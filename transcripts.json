{"episode_39": "\n\nTitle: The Watchers on the Wall[Opens on Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly standing on the edge of The Wall. It's night]\n\nSAM: What was she like?\n\nJON: She...she had red hair.\n\nSAM: Oh? How big were her feet?\n\nJON: Well what do you want me to say?\n\nSAM: I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.\n\nJON: So you and Gilly never-\n\nSAM: No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.\n\nJON: But if she had, you would've? You'd have broken your vows?\n\nSAM: The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women.\n\nJON: What?\n\nSAM: \"I shall take no wife\" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. \"I shall father no children\" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation.\n\nJON: I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.\n\nSAM: Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?\n\nJON: It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!\n\nSAM: No, you're really not.\n\nJON: And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.\n\nSAM: There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.\n\nJON: There will.\n\nSAM: They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.\n\nJON: Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch.\n\n[Sam gets in the lift back down off the wall. An owl perches on a post. Cut to the Wildlings where Thenn warg is standing with his eyes white. Ygritte, Tormund, and Styr are sitting in the background]\n\nTORMUND: Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?\n\nYGRITTE: Yes.\n\nTORMUND: Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. [?]\n\nYGRITTE: I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.\n\nTORMUND: We could be waiting here a while.\n\nYGRITTE: Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting.\n\nSTYR: You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.\n\nYGRITTE: Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon.\n\nSTYR: Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.\n\nYGRITTE: I probably killed him already.\n\nSTYR: So you've said.\n\nYGRITTE: And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.\n\nSTYR: And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.\n\n[Everyone laughs. Ygritte gets up and rushes towards Styr]\n\nYGRITTE: What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?\n\nSTYR: Maybe I have.\n\nYGRITTE: Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me.\n\n[Gilly walks along the top of the hill with her baby, looking down at the Wildling camp. She walks away quickly. Cut to Sam in the library reading]\n\nAEMON: And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?\n\nSAM: Maester Aemon. How did you know-\n\nAEMON: That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?\n\nSAM: Let me help you.\n\nAEMON: Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of irony if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?\n\nSAM: Maester [?]\n\nAEMON: Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester [?] ever got to a Wildling was this very library.\n\nSAM: But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of [?] report.\n\nAEMON: Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.\n\nSAM: I don't love her.\n\nAEMON: Yes you do.\n\nSAM: No.\n\nAEMON: Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.\n\nSAM: You were?\n\nAEMON: You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?\n\nSAM: I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that.\n\nAEMON: You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.\n\nSAM: Who was she?\n\nAEMON: Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.\n\n[Aemon gets up and blows out the candle. Sam leaves the room and outside hears Gilly at the gate talking with Pypar]\n\nPYP: I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!\n\nGILLY: They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!\n\nPYP: I'm sorry, I can't.\n\nGILLY: If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do.\n\nSAM: Pyp! Open the gate.\n\nPYP: I can't.\n\nGILLY: Sam, is that you?!\n\nSAM: Yes!\n\nPYP: The [?] gave me strict orders to not open the gate.\n\nSAM: Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!\n\n[Pyp goes to open the gate]\n\nPYP: I've never heard you curse before.\n\nSAM: Yes, well, best get used to it.\n\n[Gilly runs inside and Sam embraces her]\n\nSAM: Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella.\n\nGILLY: It was horrible.\n\nSAM: I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.\n\nGILLY: Don't let them send me away, Sam.\n\nSAM: Never.\n\nGILLY: I know there's no women allowed.\n\nSAM: Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too.\n\n[A horn sounds in the distance]\n\nALLISER: Get ready!\n\n[Members of the Night's Watch can be heard shouting frantically. The owl screeches. Cut to Thenn warg whose eyes turn back to normal]\n\nTHENN WARG: It's time.\n\n[The Wildlings get up and look at the hill. The owl flies away as the Night's Watch prepare for battle. Jon Snow walks out to the edge of The Wall and looks down upon flames in the distance. The Night's Watch light torches preparing for battle. Barrels are rolled to the edge of The Wall]\n\nJANOS: Pick up the pace!\n\n[The barrels are rolled into place]\n\nJON: There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.\n\nALLISER: A hundred thousand you say?\n\nJON: Yes sir.\n\nALLISER: You can say it if you like. We should've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.\n\nJON: It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.\n\nALLISER: Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job.\n\n[Sam and Gilly are walking down a hall. Sam unlocks a door and they both enter. The room is filled with supplies. Gilly lays her baby on a sack of something]\n\nSAM: You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.\n\nGILLY: You're leaving me again?\n\nSAM: I'm not leaving you!\n\nGILLY: You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.\n\nSAM: I...I didn't mean in the same room.\n\nGILLY: What are you going to do out there?\n\nSAM: Help my brothers.\n\nGILLY: How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.\n\nSAM: I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.\n\nGILLY: Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here.\n\nSAM: Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do.\n\n[Sam kisses Gilly]\n\nGILLY: Promise me you won't die.\n\nSAM: I promise you I won't die.\n\n[Sam turns around and leaves the room. Outside the Night's Watch is still getting ready for battle. Pyp sets some arrows up then stands back, scared]\n\nSAM: There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.\n\nPYP: I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?\n\nSAM: Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us.\n\nPYP: Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?\n\nSAM: I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.\n\nPYP: But you're afraid now?\n\nSAM: Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore.\n\n[Ygritte looks up at Castle Black. She sees Sam in the tower and she runs down the hill toward the other Wildlings]\n\nYGRITTE: Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.\n\nSTYR: How high are the walls?\n\nYGRITTE: Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened.\n\nTORMUND: Let's kill some Crows!\n\n[Everyone cheers]\n\nTORMUND: *yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*\n\n[The Wildlings head towards Castle Black. Overhead shot pans to show the castle, The Wall, and then the flames in the distance. Mance Rayder's forces are seen stomping and yelling through the woods. A giant rides a giant mammoth. The Night's Watch perched upon the wall look down at them in awe]\n\nALLISER: Archers knock, everyone else hold.\n\n[The archers get ready to shoot, Grenn accidentally drops a barrel]\n\nALLISER: I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!\n\nNIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!\n\nALLISER: Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!\n\nNIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!\n\nALLISER: You all plan to die here tonight?\n\nNIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!\n\nALLISER: That's very good to hear. Draw!\n\nMEMBER 1: Help, down below.\n\n[Tormund and his men rush Castle Black as archers shoot at them. Ygritte grabs flaming arrows from the ground and shots up at the Night's Watch]\n\nJANOS: They're attacking the southern gates!\n\nALLISER: Now?\n\nJANOS: Now!\n\nALLISER: I'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall.\n\nJANOS: What?!\n\nALLISER: What are you fucking waiting for, loose!\n\nJANOS: You heard the man. Loose!\n\n[The archers on The Wall let loose a barrage of arrows downward at Rayder's troops. They back up, then cheer. On the other side, Ygritte continues to let loose flaming arrows]\n\nTORMUND: You, over there.\n\n[Pyp shoots a crossbow down at Tormund's troops]\n\nSAM: Did you get one?\n\nPYP: No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam.\n\nSAM: Yeah?\n\nPYP: I think we're gonna die.\n\nSAM: If you keep missing we will.\n\n[Tormund's troops throw rope up at the gate. Alliser steps off the lift and walks towards the Night's Watch]\n\nALLISER: Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?\n\nNIGHT'S WATCH: No!\n\nALLISER: Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand.\n\n[Night's Watch cheers]\n\nALLISER: The Night's Watch will stand.\n\n[Night's Watch cheers]\n\nALLISER: With me now! Now, with me!\n\n[Alliser and the Night's Watch rush at the Wildlings that have scaled the gate. Pyp and Sam leave their position as Tormund scales the gate. On the other side Rayder's troops advance]\n\nJANOS: No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders.\n\nJON: We can't just let them attack the gate!\n\nJANOS: The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel.\n\nJON: Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?\n\nJANOS: No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.\n\nGRENN: Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya.\n\nJANOS: Needed below? Yes. Yes.\n\n[Janos runs away. Jon and Grenn nod at each other]\n\nJON: Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!\n\n[The archers let loose a bunch of arrows at Rayder's men as they rush the wall and begin to climb]\n\nJON: They won't summit before dawn.\n\nGRENN: How do you know that?\n\nJON: Because I've made that claim.\n\nED: I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.\n\n[Archers of the Night's Watch are lowered perpendicular to The Wall]\n\nJON: Knock! Draw! Loose!\n\n[A Wildling tries to shoot an arrow up at The Wall unsuccessfully. A giant stands next to him and shoots his own arrow up. The first rips through one of the posts. The second clears one of the Night's Watch straight off the wall. At Castle Black the fighting continues. Styr kills a man, the blood splatters on Olly's face. Janos comes down off the lift and Olly returns the lift to the top. Wildlings break into the kitchen. Janos cowardly runs down a hall toward where Gilly and her baby are hiding. He looks at her in shock. Outside Pyp finally hits someone with his crossbow.]\n\nPYP: I got one. Right through the heart, he's dead.\n\nSAM: Oh, is it over?\n\nPYP: Huh?\n\nSAM: Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*\n\n[Pyp goes up to shoot a Wildling, but Ygrytte shoots an arrow right through his neck. He falls into Sam's arms]\n\nSAM: You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester [?] is coming, he's gonna make it alright.\n\nJON: Now!\n\nED: Now!\n\n[The Night's Watch drop barrels down toward the Wildlings that approach the gate. Two giants and a mammoth approach the gate and begin pulling at it with long ropes]\n\nJON: *to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate.\n\nGRENN: Alright.\n\nJON: *grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...\n\nGRENN: They won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three, on me! Come on you lazy bastards!\n\nJON: Oil!\n\nED: Oil on the ramp!\n\nALLISER: Protect the gate!\n\n[Alliser and Tormund start fighting each other like badasses. Tormund slices Alliser in the gut. Alliser falls to the ground and gets dragged  underneath]\n\nALLISER: Hold the fucking gate! Hold it!\n\n[Sam sits with Pyp on his lap, dead. He lays him on the ground and grabs the crossbow. He makes a run for the lift as Thenn warg sees him and chases after him. Sam shoots him in the head with his crossbow. Grenn and the men that came down with him get off the lift]\n\nSAM: *to Grenn* We need more men down here.\n\nGRENN: We have to hold the gate.\n\nSAM: But we need men here.\n\nGRENN: Tell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!\n\n[Sam gets in the lift]\n\nSAM: *to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!\n\n[Olly sits on the ground with his hands over his ears in fear]\n\nSAM: Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?\n\n[Olly raises the lift]\n\nSAM: And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!\n\n[Olly looks down at a bow and arrow. On The Wall, barrels of flaming oil are dropped down on the giants and the mammoth. The mammoth goes running off and one of the giants chases after it. Up top, one of the barrels got stuck and the men of the Night's Watch frantically try to get it off the ramp. A spear is fired down at one of the giants and it hits him right in the back. The other giant shouts in anger and goes to raise the gate with his bare hands. The barrel explodes on the ramp. Sam approaches Jon]\n\nJON: What are you doing up here?\n\nSAM: The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.\n\nJON: Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.\n\n[Jon leaves his post and grabs his sword]\n\nJON: Two brothers now fight with me.\n\nED: Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!\n\n[Grenn gets to the inner gate with his men as the giant continues to raise the gate]\n\nDONNEL: How are we gonna stop that?\n\nCOOPER: We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.\n\nGRENN: You heard Jon, we hold the gate.\n\nDONNEL: Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.\n\nGRENN: We hold the gate!\n\n[The giant lifts the gate and goes under it]\n\nDONNEL: Mother save me. Father save me.\n\nGRENN: The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?\n\nDONNEL: No, please.\n\n[The giant rushes toward the inner gate as Grenn and his men stand in fear, ready to fight]\n\nGRENN: Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns\n\nAll TOGETHER: And win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come!\n\n[Jon, Sam, and the other men ride the lift to the bottom]\n\nJON: *to Sam* I don't want you out there.\n\nSAM: You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.\n\n[Jon hands Sam a key]\n\nJON: I need him more than I need you.\n\n[Sam nods as Jon opens the lift door early and leaps out and begins fighting. So begins the most incredible shot in the series, as the camera pans around the entire battlefield showing us glimpses of this truly epic battle. Sam runs to a door and unlocks it]\n\nSAM: We need you boy.\n\n[Ghost runs out and attacks one of the men that Jon was fighting. Tormund gets his first arrow to the back. Styr sees Jon and rushes to fight him. They go at it for a bit. Ygritte runs out of arrows so she jumps down and steals some from a dead body. Styr and Jon are still fighting as Ygritte finally spots Jon. Styr slams Jon's face against an anvil. Jon kills Styr with a hammer. As he turns around he sees Yrgitte with an arrow aimed right at him. They both stare, Jon smiles. An arrow goes straight through Ygritte's chest. She falls to the ground. It was Olly, that bastard. Jon rushes to catch Ygritte]\n\nYGRITTE: Jon Snow.\n\nJON: No, shh, don't talk.\n\nYGRITTE: Do you remember that cave?\n\n[Jon nods]\n\nYGRITTE: We should've stayed in that cave.\n\nJON: We'll go back there.\n\nYGRITTE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.\n\n[Ygritte dies. The battle rages on as Jon holds Ygritte's dead body. On the other side, Rayder's troops are climbing the wall]\n\nED: Drop the scythe, boys!\n\n[A massive scythe drops down on the men]\n\nED: Hoister up!\n\n[Rayder's troops retreat]\n\nED: They've had enough for one night.\n\n[The Night's Watch cheers in excitement]\n\nED: Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.\n\n[Inside Castle Black's walls Tormund is still alive, swinging his sword with two arrows in his back]\n\nJON: Tormund. It's over, let it end.\n\nTORMuND: This is how a man ends.\n\n[Jon grabs a crossbow and shoots Tormund in the leg then kicks away his weapon]\n\nJON: Put him in chains. We'll question him later.\n\nTORMUND: I should've thrown you from the top of your wall boy!\n\nJON: Aye, you should've.\n\n[Gilly hears someone entering her room. She grabs a leg of meat as a weapon and rushes the door]\n\nSAM: Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?\n\n[Sam turns around and sees Janos. Outside the Night's Watch clean up after the battle. Sam and Jon descend the stairs]\n\nSAM: We held them off.\n\nJON: For one night.\n\nSAM: This is a great victory.\n\nJON: Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them.\n\nSAM: Where are you going?\n\nJON: I'm going to find Mance.\n\nSAM: To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.\n\nJON: Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home.\n\nSAM: Without Mance? You're going to kill him?\n\nJON: I'm going to try.\n\nSAM: They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him.\n\nJON: He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.\n\nSAM: He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!\n\nJON: You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?\n\n[Jon stands there for a second as he and Sam look at each other, then he walks off, Sam scampering after him. They walk down the tunnel toward the gate. The giant and Grenn and his men are dead on the ground]\n\nJON: They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out.\n\n[Sam waves his torch to signal the raising of the gate. Jon removes his sword]\n\nSAM: What are you doing?\n\nJON: I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.\n\nSAM: Jon. Come back.\n\n[The gate raises and Jon walks through it]\n\n", "episode_28": "Is the Wall as big as they say? Bigger. How much longer? A few more days. I found something at the Fist of the First Men. What does it do? Sam: I'm not sure that it does anything. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-- He said you're a traitor. I am, child. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. My lady, I can't read the words. I wouldn't know where to start. At the beginning. This word is Aegon. Barristan: The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them. But they won't meet us on the field. They have strong walls. Women in our position must make the best of our circumstances. How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him. I didn't ask for this marriage. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her. My feelings for you have not changed. Listen to me, my lady. I'm not your lady. I'm your whore. You will release every slave in Yunkai. You are mad. We have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well. ( screeching ) He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about? I don't know. Find out. Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your blood is noble. I'm just a b*st*rd. The b*st*rd of Robert of the House Baratheon. There is power in a king's blood. You're a liar! You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. Now-- Anguy, bring her back. Man: Come back, girl! Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good. ( theme music playing ) ( birds chirping ) I'll give you one try, girl. Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard. Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you. There's no one worse than you. Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them. You're lying. Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open. Is that the Blackwater? The Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you? Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen. f*ck Joffrey. f*ck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins. But why? Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you. Why would they be at the Twins? ( chuckles ) Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding. ( horses neighing ) Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted. Jorah: They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well. You know these men? Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, \"The Titan's b*st*rd.\" Is he more titan or b*st*rd? He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are. How many? Barristan: 2,000, Your Grace. Armored and mounted. Enough to make a difference? It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side. I imagine you're right. I'd like to talk to the Titan's b*st*rd about winning. He may not agree to meet. He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl. Barristan: Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons-- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and...Daario Naharis. You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I f*cked you once in a pleasure house in Lys. Mind your tongue. Mero: Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it. ( laughs ) You, slave girl, bring wine. We have no slaves here. You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons. Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons? Under 2,000, Your Grace. We have more, don't we? Barristan: 10,000 Unsullied. I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us. I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have 8,000 Unsullied. You're very young to be a captain. He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant. Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side. The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won. The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run. Or you could fight for me. ( Mero laughs ) We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai. Daenerys: I would pay you as much and more. - ( sniffs ) Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again. Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms. You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry. A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide. Show me your c**t. I want to see if it's worth fighting for. _ You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder. Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink? A barrel, then. Good. The Titan's b*st*rd does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you. I'll come looking for you when this is over. Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first. Gladly, Your Grace. Half Robert, half lowborn. Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon. What do you mean to do with him? You know what I mean to do with him. Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy. Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king? No. If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor. You've slaughtered many lambs? And none have seen the blade. ( door closes ) Davos: \"And tho-- and thowg... V-v-visenya... Targaryen... rod-- rode Vhagar-- Vhag--\" f*ck me. ( sighs ) \"Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still... large enog-- enough-- enough to swallow a horse whole.\" Your Grace. They feeding you enough? Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain. You don't belong in a place like this. Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse. Yeah. I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad. Melisandre's returned. I didn't know she'd been gone. Came back with a b*st*rd boy. Robert's b*st*rd boy. Why? She says there's power in king's blood. She's going to kill him. Sacrifice him. Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew. What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night? Because he has your blood in his veins. So did Renly. Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent. How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women? The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one b*st*rd boy against a kingdom? Your Grace, why did you come to see me today? I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again. I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her. You have little regard for your own life. Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me,\"I don't ever want to die.\" I wanted to say to him, \"You won't, child. You won't ever.\" I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night. I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed,but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real? ( horse neighs ) ( people chatting ) Little dragon bitch. She talks too much. You talk too much. She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock. 8,000 Unsullied stand between her and your cock. ( laughs ) My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach? She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me. Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores. I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend. She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference? I fight for beauty. For beauty? We fight for gold. The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die-- the thrill of f*cking a woman who wants to be f*cked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you. You'll die young. Prendahl: What do we do about the dragon girl? We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield. There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her. She's well guarded. Mero: Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights. Which one of us? Close your eyes, love. Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking. Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here. You have something for me? Valar morghulis. ( knock at door ) ( sighs ) Lady Sansa. You look very handsome, my lord. Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden? My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this. I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord. No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say-- I'm just trying to say very badly-- I just-- just want to say I know how you feel. I doubt that very much, my lord. You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel. But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine? When I have to. Well, today you have to. Margaery: You look radiant, Your Grace. Radiant? Why radiant? It's the word that came to mind. ( chuckles ) We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends. You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice. A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid. Ah, but you know the song \"The Rains of Castamere\"? Of course. They play it so often here at court. So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere? Not as well as you, I'm sure. House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now? Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now? Gone. Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword. I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. \"And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.\" If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep. ( doors open ) What are you doing? Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband. You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection. ( light laughter ) ( snickers ) ( laughter ) ( laughter stops ) Could you... Thank you. Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever. Have you ever seen one like it? I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life. It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it. In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken. ( liquid pouring ) Here, taste this. You think I'm trying to poison you? That's good. That's really good. Where do you think it's from? I couldn't even guess. Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take. That thought had crossed my mind, yeah. There are no mistakes. Not for us. I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern. Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us. I don't understand. This-- this doesn't seem very religious. According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up c**ts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see. Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I. ( breathing heavily ) Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me. ( both moaning ) What are you doing? You have to trust me. What--? Get it away. Get it off me. Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much. Why are you doing this? I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood. No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there! You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration. Gendry: Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord! ( cries out ) The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. ( music playing ) ( people chatting ) So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute. ( snorts ) Will you pardon me, my lord? Of course. Of course. En-- enjoy. Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead. I've got a lifetime for that. Stay. You seem rather drunk. Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding? Tywin: This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible. And? If you're going to give her one, you need to perform. What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast. More than once. There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit. You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty. Well... My father once told me-- Nobody cares what your father once told you. Congratulations, my lady. Thank you, Your Grace. Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it? What a glorious day. Yes, Your Grace. I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that? You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down. ( claps ) Time for the bedding ceremony. ( cheering ) There will be no bedding ceremony. Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy. There will be no bedding ceremony. There will be if I command it. Then you'll be f*cking your own bride with a wooden cock. What did you say? What did you say?! I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king. ( laughs ) A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there. Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace. Tyrion: I am. Guilty. But-- but it is my wedding night. My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife. I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood. Is that wise, my lord? Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion. Is that wise, Tyrion? Nothing was ever wiser. Astoundingly long. What? Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly? 14. Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage. Stop. I can't. I could, I won't. But your father-- If my father wants someone to get f*cked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to. What if I never want you to? And so my watch begins. ( thuds ) ( horse neighs ) ( chatter ) 19? Yes, Your Grace. How can anyone speak 19 languages? It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well. Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope-- what do you mean reasonably well? Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh. Athjahakar. Athjahaka. Ath-ja-hakar. Athjahakar. Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice. Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry. ( Missandei gasps ) No screaming or she dies. What do you want? You. Let her go. Don't scream, lovely girl. You were sent here to kill me? ( chuckles ) So why haven't you? I don't want to. What do your captains have to say about that? You should ask them. Why? We had philosophical differences. Over what? Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them. You're a strange man. I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do. And this is supposed to impress me? Yes. Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades? They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine. Will you fight for me? Swear to me. The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours. ( door opens ) ( door closes ) You really ought to knock. I brought your breakfast. ( door opens, closes ) ( wind howling ) ( baby fusses ) ( cawing ) It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night. ( baby fussing ) ( caws ) ( wind howling ) ( stones clacking ) How hard can it be to build a fire? It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm. ( baby fusses ) He winked at me before. I doubt it. I saw him wink at me. He blinked. I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink. A what? Well, I mean, there's no real difference. A wink is on purpose. You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name. Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me? What? No. This is just the way I talk. I'll build that fire. Don't you think he should have a name? I don't know many boys' names. Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jon... ( stones clacking ) Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer. Craster. Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-- Mormont. That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name. Why is it a last name? Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly. His name is Samwell Tarly, too? No, Randyll Tarly. Randyll is a handsome name. Please don't name him Randyll. Is your father cruel like mine? ( crows cawing ) Different manner of cruel. Not Randyll, then. ( crows cawing loudly ) Don't. Don't go out there. I'll be back. I just want to look. ( loud cawing continues ) Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-- ( screeching ) ( cawing stops ) ( chittering ) It's come for the baby. Stay back! You stay back! ( baby crying ) No, you can't have him! No! No! ( shouting ) ( screams ) ( roaring ) ( screeching ) ( crows cawing ) ( both panting ) ( cawing )", "episode_29": "You think I can't hear you every day talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and black magic? I don't want you talking to him till we get to Castle Black. We're not going to Castle Black. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall. Oh, no, I'm not going back there. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further. You won't win. You don't have the discipline. You don't know how to fight together. You don't know that. If you attack the Wall you'll die, all of you. All of us. I can't force them to meet us in the field. Casterly Rock can't run away. Can you do it? There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army. Walder Frey. We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs. Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters. You were sent here to kill me? I don't want to. What do your captains have to say about that? Daario: You should ask them. Will you fight for me? The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours. Is that the Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you? Back to King's Landing. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins. Your uncle's marrying one of the Frey girls. Your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you. That rain will cost us another day. Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight. He's getting the wedding he wanted. He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted. It's come for the baby. You stay back! ( grunts ) No, you can't have him. No! ( yelling ) ( screams ) ( howls ) ( panting ) ( crows cawing ) ( theme music playing ) ( crickets chirping ) Catelyn: Are you sure about this? No. It's dangerous. If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home,take his gold, take his power. Why are you telling me? You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice. Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground, the North is overrun with ironborn, and Bran and Rickon are gone. So Casterly Rock... I'm asking your advice. We have enough men? If Walder Frey cooperates. If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing before we take the castle... we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea. We'll lose the war and die the way Father died. Or worse. Show them how it feels to lose what they love. Walder: My honored guests... be welcome within my walls and at my table. I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven. We thank you for your hospitality, my lord. I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness. Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace. It wasn't me you spurned. It was my girls. One of them was supposedto be queen. Now none of them are. This is Arwyen my daughter. My daughter Walda,my daughter Derwa,my daughter Waldra. My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.Serra and Sarra,granddaughters, twins. You could have had either.Could have had bothfor all I care. My granddaughter Marianne.My granddaughter Freya. My granddaughter...Wertha. Waldra. Waldina. I'm Merry. Fine. And here's my youngest daughter Shirei,though she hasn't bled yet. Clearly you don't have the patience for all that. My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be luckyto have any one of you. I did what I didnot to slight you,but because I loved another. I know these wordscannot set rightthe wrong I have doneto you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends. Walder:Very good. There she is. Come closer. Let me have a look at you. Still can't see you. Old eyes. Love. That's what the Starksof Winterfell call it, eh? ( chuckles ) Very honorable. I call it a pretty face. Mmm, very pretty. Prettier than this lot, that's for sure. Very shapely as well. Oh, you try to hide herunder that dress. If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place. I can always see what's going on beneath a dress. Been at this a long time. I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is. Doesn't drop an inch. Your king says he betrayed me for love. I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit. And I can respect that. When I was your age, I'd have broken 50 oaths to get into that without a second thought. Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot. We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men. Thank you, my lord. Well, let's get ready. The wine will flow redand the music will play loudand we'll put this mess behind us. ( horse neighs ) ( weapons clang ) Where? There. There. It's a back gate. My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves. Your men, but not you? Daario: I have no interest in slaves. A man cannot make love to property. This is where we enter the city. Very few guards. They know me. They let me inside-- We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate. I kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates. Then comes the army. Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours. Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkaiwill pay you your feeand you won't have to split it three ways 'cause you've already slaughtered your partners. You have a very suspicious mind. In my experience, only dishonest people think this way. You command the Unsullied. What do you think? You leave tonight. Very good. We'll prepare. Ser Jorah. You can use an extra sword. You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost, no matter our pride. We're west of Castle Black,but the Nightfort's closest to us. It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I. Too big. Impossible to maintain. Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. No one's used it in centuries most likely. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort,if one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens, I do. How do you know all that? I read about it in a very old book. You know all that from staring at marks on paper? Yes. You're like a wizard. Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived. Here we are. Alive. ( donkey braying ) Remember what happens to children who run. I'm your father and I'll do the talking. The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning. Need a hand? Need about eight hands. Oh! Got to get this salt pork to the Twins in time for the wedding. Many thanks. Don't! Don't kill him. Dead rats don't squeak. You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are. More than anyone you know. You're wrong. I know a killer. A real killer. That so? You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger. That him? No. Good. Don't kill him. Please. Please don't. You're very kind. Someday it'll get you killed. ( groaning ) ( grunts ) Where are we? The Gift, I think. Brandon the Builder gave all this landsouth of the Wallto the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support. Maester Luwin taught me that. Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment. It's good land and there's no war up here. Why leave? Wildlings. Sorry. But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women. Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it. That's what Old Nan said. There's a storm coming. I don't see any-- ( thunder rolling ) It's as good a place to shelter as any. We can drink some blood while we wait. I don't need much. ( screeching ) Only one old man and eight good horses. What's one old man doing with eight horses? He breeds them for the Watch. How's he keep folks from stealing them? The Watch protects him. Not today they don't. He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there. Tormund: And proper steel. Let's carve him up. We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat. I keep telling you. He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear. The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers. I hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough. Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do. Spread out. Surround the hut and move in. ( sword clangs ) ( snorts ) ( neighing ) Ygritte! Man:Clear the barn! No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all. Best part of the animal. Don't worry. They're still there. I know they're still there. You check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move. I'm not afraid. Of course you are. You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it. The closer you get, the worse the fear gets. No point in trying to hide behind that face. I know fear when I see it. Seen it a lot. I knew fear when I saw it in you. You're afraid of fire. When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl. And I know why, too.I heard whatyour brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop. That give you some ideas? Might do. Go ahead, then. You might get away. Might even make it there on your own. They're just over the river. The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck. Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull. ( thunder rumbling ) ( thunder crashes ) How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it's 700 feet high. ( thunder crashes ) How did you get past it? Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals. It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals. Some climb straight up the ice. Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back. Hodor. 19 castles guard the Wall. ( thunder booms ) Only three are still manned. Hodor! One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through. My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted. Well, we'll have to open them up again. ( hoofbeats, horse neighs ) Whoa, whoa, whoa! Meera: There's a rider out there. Just one? ( thunder crashes ) Meera: There's more. Hodor! ( horses neighing ) Shh. Shh. It's just thunder, sweet giant. Hodor. Man: I yield. =- I yield. Wildlings. =( men shouting ) =Where's Shaggydog and Summer? =- Hunting. ( horses neighing ) =- ( thunder crashes ) Hodor! =- Shh, quiet, Hodor. Hodor! =Make him shut up. If they hear us... =- Hush, Hodor. No-- no more Hodoring. Hodor! Hodor! Hodor, calm down. You need to keep quiet. They're gonna hear us. ( Hodor shouting ) Bran: Hodor, be quiet. ( thunder crashes ) Ah! Hodor! Hodor, calm down. Hodor! Hodor! Hodor, be quiet! What did you do? Nothing. I don't know. ( horse screaming ) What's that? That's a horse dying. Man:Bring them over here. Man #2: That was the last of them. The rest are dead. Orell: I heard shouting up there. Thunder. I know the difference between shouting and thunder. Maybe it's ghosts. ( laughs ) ( eagle screeching ) That won't help you, grandpa. Where you riding? Doesn't matter now, does it? No, it doesn't matter now. Cut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here. You understand. Let me stand at least. Let me go with a bit of dignity. Make the crow kill him. You're one of us now. Prove it. The wolves are out there. I can't do it by choice. I don't know how. It happens in my dreams. You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood. I can't. You just did with him. A wolf is nothing compared to that. She looks sharp. ( muttering prayer ) Do it. Do it. I told you. He's still one of them. Go on, boy. Go on! ( groans ) He's a crow. He'll always be a crow. And here's his crow wife guarding him. He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets. Kill him. ( Jon shouts ) ( screaming ) He's one of them. No! Do you hear me? ( screams ) You're not gonna die for one of them. Do it. They'll find us if you don't. ( swords clanging ) ( breathing heavily ) ( growling ) ( Orell shouts ) ( gasps ) You were right the whole time. ( gasps ) ( eagle screeches ) ( Jon screaming ) Hyah! Daario: When you hear a songbird's whistle, you come. I'm a great whistler. The greatest in the land. ( guard shouts in Valyrian ) Daario Naharis. ( whistling ) Daario: That one was quick. There may be others. I doubt it. The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them. ( guards shouting ) That's what you call a few guards? ( guards shouting ) ( men shouting ) Come on! What do you got, huh? ( cheering ) Lord Edmure... I hope I'm not a disappointment to you. ( chuckles ) You're a delight to me, my lady. You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection. In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon each other and say the words. Both:Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger... I am hers... I am his... and she is mine... and he is mine... Both: ...from this dayuntil the end of my days. Is that safe? They're long gone. You were right. I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want. Of course you can. North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals. But you did a lotmore than that.You got inside Hodor's mind. They can't do that north of the Wall? No one can do that...anywhere. When I was looking through Summer's eyes, I saw Jon. Where? He was with the wildlings. 466 00:34:36,692 --] 00:34:38,727 They tried to kill him, but he got away. 467 00:34:38,761 --] 00:34:40,395 Osha: He'll be heading back to Castle Black, then. 468 00:34:40,430 --] 00:34:42,264 That's where we should go. 469 00:34:42,298 --] 00:34:44,666 For all we know, Castle Black's already under attack. 470 00:34:44,701 --] 00:34:47,502 If this many wildlings got through-- I already told you. 471 00:34:47,570 --] 00:34:49,538 I'm not going north of the Wall. 472 00:34:49,572 --] 00:34:52,541 Everything Jojen told me is true. 473 00:34:54,477 --] 00:34:56,745 You saw what I did to Hodor. 474 00:34:56,779 --] 00:34:58,747 I have to find the three-eyed raven. 475 00:34:58,781 --] 00:35:00,349 Listen to me, little lord. Don't worry. I'm not asking you to come with me. It won't be safe for Rickon. Me? I'm coming with you. No. You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth. The Umbers are our bannermen. They'll protect you. I'm coming with you. I'm your brother. I have to protect you. Right now I have to protect you. Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall. If something happens to us,you're the heir to Winterfell. Would you know how to find the Last Hearth? You southerners build your big castles and you never move. You're easy to find. We're not southerners. And I don't want to leave you. Shh, shh. Come here, little soldier. You and me, we're gonna have some adventures. You don't have to do any of this. ( crying ) Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be. Shh. We'll be fine, you and me. The Umbers are great warriors. Even I heard about them growing up. They'll teach you how to swing a sword. I know how to swing a sword. ( kisses ) You're leaving now? It's the middle of the night. I learned to walk in darkness. Say your good-byes, little man. Keep this one safe. He means the world to me. We've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city? It was just as you said. They did not believe until it was too late. Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered. And Daario Naharis? ( footsteps ) The city is yours, my queen. ( music playing ) ( people laughing, chatting ) They're good, aren't they? They ought to be because they cost enough. ( laughs ) Look at the crowd there. ( Catelyn laughs ) He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun, and now look at him. Blackfish: The gods love to reward a fool. Uncle. What? He's my nephew. I love him. And he's a damned fool. ( chuckles ) Don't you drink, Lord Bolton? Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses. That's the point. Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls? Aye. Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry. So I have a fat young bride. ( laughs ) I hope she makes you very happy. Well, she's made me very rich. Pardon, my lord, my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on. My mother's alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her. Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I've ever met. Be kind. She's finally starting to like you. And I like her. But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there eating blackberriesout of Roslin Frey's hand. Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake. ( scoffs ) Striking your king is an act of treason. No, don't. Don't insult them. Your Grace. ( pounding on tables ) ( pounding stops ) The septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said, and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak. But they are not yet man and wife. A sword needs a sheath. ( guests laughing ) ( laughs ) And a wedding needs a bedding. ( guests cheering ) What does my sire say? ( guests chanting ) To bed! To bed! To bed! If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them. ( guests cheering ) ( music playing ) ( chanting ) To bed! To bed! To bed! Man:Go on! Oh! Careful now, ladies. Once you set that monster free, there's no caging him again. ( chanting continues ) To bed! To bed! To bed! Poor girl. Every bride suffers the same. I'm sure you endured yours with grace. Oh, Ned forbade it. He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night. ( chuckles ) That is a very strange custom. I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective. It seems normal to you? It's a tradition. Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage. But there are other ways of providing proof. Boy or girl? I don't know. But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him. Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming. Eddard. Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses? I do. ( band playing \"Rains of Castamere\" ) ( wolf whining ) ( whines ) Man: Go on, line 'em up! ( chatter, laughter ) ( laughing ) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going? Got salt pork for the feast. The feast is over. Hound: Doesn't sound like it's over. If I tell you it's over, it's over. Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here. Got pig's feet, too. Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around. ( music stops ) Your Grace. I feel I've been remissin my duties. I've given you meatand wine and music,but I haven't shown youthe hospitality you deserve. My king has marriedand I owe my new queena wedding gift. Robb! ( gasping ) ( grunts ) ( screams continue ) ( screaming ) ( men laughing ) Stark soldier: You ready to head home to Winterfell, right? ( men laughing ) Stark soldier:Feast over yet, is it? Aye, it's over. ( men screaming ) ( wolf howling ) ( banging ) ( growling ) ( growling ) Guard:Follow him. Aim! ( snarling ) ( growls ) ( wolf whines ) ( guard shouting ) ( groaning ) ( guards shouting ) It's too late. ( grunting ) ( fighting continues ) ( chuckles ) The King in the North arises. ( chuckles ) Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please. He is my son. My first son. Let him go and I swear that we will forget this. I swear it by the old gods and new. We will take no vengeance. You already swore me one oath right here in my castle. You swore by all the gods your son would marry my daughter! Catelyn: Take me for a hostage, but let Robb go. Robb, get up. Get up and walk out. Please! Please! And why would I let him do that? On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat. I'll find another. Mother. The Lannisters send their regards. ( knife pierces ) ( wails ) ( knife clatters )", "episode_60": "\n\nTITLE SEQUENCEINT. RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBERCERSEI is standing at the balcony looking out across King s Landing at the Great Sept of Baelor.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMEN S CHAMBER\n\nTOMMEN is being dressed by an attendant.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - MARGAERY S CHAMBER\n\nMARGAERY is being dressed by a handmaiden.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW dresses himself in a roughspun tunic, sliding his hands through the sleeves one by one.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMEN S CHAMBER\n\nThe attendant places a large golden necklace around TOMMEN s neck.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - MARGAERY S CHAMBER\n\nThe handmaiden finishes tying MARGAERY s dress and fixes her hair.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMEN S CHAMBER\n\nThe attendant places TOMMEN s crown on top of his head. TOMMEN looks out the window.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nA pair of Faith Militant men open the main door to the Sept. A crowd of nobles filters inside.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - LORAS  CELL\n\nLORAS sits in the back of his cell, muttering to himself. LANCEL and two other Faith Militant enter. LORAS cowers. The Faith Militant take hold of LORAS.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW and six other septons enter. They walk down the steps. MARGAERY appears in the crowd beside her father, MACE. She and the HIGH SPARROW exchange a glance as he walks by. The HIGH SPARROW and the other septons occupy seven chairs seated in a circle around the central chamber of the sept. MARGAERY looks around.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMEN s CHAMBER\n\nTOMMEN is sitting in a chair in the center of the room, looking out the window. His attendant enters.\n\nATTENDANT: Your Grace. The trial will be getting underway soon.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBER\n\nA handmaiden connects a golden chain between two golden shoulder fastenings on CERSEI s dress.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMEN S CHAMBER\n\nTOMMEN says nothing. The attendant leaves.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBER\n\nThe handmaiden places a ring on CERSEI s middle finger.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - MAESTER PYCELLE S CHAMBER\n\nPYCELLE is standing in front of a bureau. He picks up a piece of paper and reads it, then picks up his chain, places it around his neck, and looks in the mirror. A mistress lying on his bed stares at him in the reflection of the mirror.\n\nMISTRESS: You got my money?\n\nPYCELLE: Later. Go away.\n\nThe mistress stands and leaves. PYCELLE straightens himself out, sighs, and exits the room. In the hallway, he walks down a set of steps. A young girl appears on the steps behind him.\n\nGIRL: Grand Maester.\n\nPYCELLE turns back to look at her and walks over to her. He bends down and she whispers into his ear.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nLANCEL and a group of Faith Militant usher LORAS into the sept and down the steps. His hair has been shorn. MARGAERY stares at him. The Faith Militant lead him to the center of the room and move away. The HIGH SPARROW stands.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?\n\nLORAS: There ll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: To which crimes will you be confessing?\n\nLORAS: All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.\n\nThe crowd murmurs.\n\nLORAS: I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity  dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: The gods  judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her.\n\nLORAS kneels.\n\nLORAS: I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: You understand fully what this means?\n\nLORAS: I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Brother Loras \n\nLORAS begins to cry.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: ...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW touches LORAS  face. LORAS looks up at him.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?\n\nLORAS: I will.\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW smiles. The HIGH SPARROW nods. Two Faith Militant approach LORAS and take him by the arms. A third approaches him from behind, draws a knife, and begins carving the mark of the Seven into LORAS  forehead. MACE stirs.\n\nMACE: No, I can t let them \n\nMARGAERY blocks her father with her arm.\n\nMARGAERY: Faith is the way, Father.\n\nLORAS whinces.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBER\n\nThe handmaiden finishes dressing CERSEI and steps away from her.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMEN S CHAMBER\n\nSomeone approaches TOMMEN.\n\nTOMMEN: All right. I m ready.\n\nTOMMEN stands and turns around. GREGOR is standing in the doorway.\n\nTOMMEN: I have to go, I m-- I m late for the trial.\n\nTOMMEN walks towards GREGOR. GREGOR puts his hand on TOMMEN s shoulder, blocking his path.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBER\n\nThe handmaiden exits. CERSEI looks over her shoulder.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nThe Faith Militant has finished carving LORAS s forehead. KEVAN watches from the crowd. MARGAERY has made her way to the floor in front of the HIGH SPARROW.\n\nMARGAERY: You mutilated him. You gave me your word.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: I ve kept my word. Once the queen mother s trial is concluded, Brother Loras is free to leave.\n\nMARGAERY: And where is the queen mother?\n\nLANCEL: Her litter never left the Red Keep.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: It appears the queen mother doesn t wish to attend her own trial.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBER\n\nCERSEI pours herself a glass of wine.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nHIGH SPARROW (to LANCEL): Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.\n\nLANCEL nods and exits with several Faith Militant.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBER\n\nCERSEI walks to the balcony with her glass of wine.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS\n\nLANCEL emerges onto the steps with the Faith Militant. He sees a boy running down the steps. The boy looks over his shoulder at LANCEL.\n\nLANCEL: Get the others.\n\nThe other Faith Militant disperse. LANCEL looks over the railing and sees the boy enter a door at the foot of the steps.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURN S LAB\n\nThe young girl opens the door and leads PYCELLE inside. PYCELLE looks around.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS\n\nLANCEL runs to the door the boy entered and then goes inside. It leads to a tunnel. LANCEL sees the boy running down the tunnel with a lit torch. He starts after the boy.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURN S LAB\n\nPYCELLE walks down the steps and into the lab, then turns around to see QYBURN sitting in a chair behind him.\n\nPYCELLE: Where s the king?\n\nQYBURN stands.\n\nQYBURN: Elsewhere, I m afraid.\n\nPYCELLE: What s the meaning of this? I was told that-- I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence--\n\nQYBURN: Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can.\n\nPYCELLE turns around. A young boy emerges from the shadows with a knife.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS\n\nLANCEL continues to follow the boy through the tunnels.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURN S LAB\n\nMore children brandishing knives appear.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS\n\nLANCEL runs down the tunnel after the boy.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURN S LAB\n\nQYBURN: This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest.\n\nThe girl who led PYCELLE into the room brandishes a knife.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS\n\nLANCEL turns a corner and finds a smaller tunnel. He gets down on his hands and knees and crawls through it.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - QYBURN S LAB\n\nThe children converge on PYCELLE. PYCELLE slaps one of them but is overwhelmed. The children stab him repeatedly with their knives, killing him. QYBURN watches.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS\n\nLANCEL happens upon the boy s torch and raises it up.\n\nLANCEL: The longer you wait, the worse it ll be for you.\n\nLANCEL spies a side passageway lined with barrels. The boy sneaks up on him and stabs him in the side. LANCEL yells and falls to the ground. The boy runs away. LANCEL breathes heavily. The boy returns and looks at LANCEL.\n\nLANCEL: What are you doing?\n\nThe boy runs away.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nThe crowd is murmuring. MARGAERY looks around at them, then looks at LORAS. LORAS is hanging his head, his eyes downcast.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS\n\nLANCEL looks down the tunnel and sees a glimmer of light. He drags himself through the dirt towards it.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBER\n\nCERSEI is standing at the balcony, staring out at the Great Sept of Baelor.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nMARGAERY looks around.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS\n\nLANCEL crawls closer to the other end of the hall. There is a green glow all around him.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nMARGAERY hurries over to the HIGH SPARROW.\n\nMARGAERY: There s something wrong.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: You have nothing to fear, Your Grace. The trial will begin shortly.\n\nMARGAERY: Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--\n\nMARGAERY: Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I m telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave.\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW scoffs and shakes his head.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS\n\nLANCEL has almost reached the end of the tunnel. He sees green pools of liquid on the ground in front of two barrels with candles in their centers. The candles have almost burned down to nothing. He looks around at the casks lining the walls of the tunnel and pulls himself onward towards the candles.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nMARGAERY (to the crowd): We all need to leave now!\n\nMARGAERY hurries over to LORAS. The crowd begins to stir. MARGAERY takes LORAS  chin and lifts his face so his eyes meet hers.\n\nMARGAERY: Loras. Stay with me.\n\nMARGAERY ushers him towards the steps.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS\n\nLANCEL groans as he pulls himself closer to the candles.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nMARGAERY hurries towards the exit with LORAS. The crowd begins to panic and also heads towards the exit. Two Faith Militant block MARGAERY s path to the exit.\n\nMARGAERY: Let me through. Let me through. Get out of my way.\n\nMARGAERY pushes against the guards. The HIGH SPARROW looks around at the crowd.\n\nMARGAERY: Let us through!\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS\n\nLANCEL reaches the candles. He tries to blow out the flame with his breath, but it won t go out.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nMARGAERY looks over her shoulder at the HIGH SPARROW. They stare into each other s eyes.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS\n\nThe flame from the candle touches the pool of green liquid and ignites it. The surrounding barrels are ignited and explode in a mass of green flame. LANCEL is incinerated. The explosion travels down the tunnel, igniting all of the barrels.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nThe sound of an explosion can be heard. The green flame erupts from the center of the sept, incinerating the HIGH SPARROW and then engulfing the entire sept, killing everyone inside. The sept crumbles from the force of the explosion. The bell from its tower is flung down into the city, smashing into a bystander. The flames rush out from the sept.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBER\n\nCERSEI watches the explosion. She cocks her head back, then smiles, sips her wine, and walks away.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMEN S CHAMBER\n\nGREGOR is standing in the hallway.TOMMEN is staring out the window at the explosion with his mouth hanging open. GREGOR exits.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - UNKNOWN CHAMBER\n\nSEPTA UNELLA is lying strapped to a table. CERSEI stands over her and pours wine in her face. SEPTA UNELLA sputters and struggles against her bindings.\n\nCERSEI: Confess. Confess.\n\nCERSEI raises a pitcher of wine over SEPTA UNELLA s head.\n\nSEPTA UNELLA: No.\n\nCERSEI: Confess.\n\nCERSEI pours the pitcher into SEPTA UNELLA s face. SEPTA UNELLA sputters and struggles. When the pitcher is empty, SEPTA UNELLA gasps for air.\n\nCERSEI: Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn t do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother  because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow  and all his little sparrows  all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.\n\nCERSEI touches SEPTA UNELLA s face.\n\nCERSEI: You ve always been quiet.\n\nCERSEI walks around the table.\n\nCERSEI: I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?\n\nSEPTA UNELLA: Good. I m glad to see your face. I m ready to meet the gods.\n\nCERSEI: What? Now? Today? You re not going to die today. You re not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.\n\nGREGOR enters the room.\n\nCERSEI: This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He s quiet, too.\n\nSEPTA UNELLA looks at GREGOR. GREGOR removes his helmet. His face is cloaked in shadow.\n\nCERSEI: Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.\n\nCERSEI walks towards the exit. GREGOR enters. His face is purple and mangled. He puts his helmet down on the table next to SEPTA UNELLA.\n\nSEPTA UNELLA: No.\n\nSEPTA UNELLA struggles against her bindings, then cries out in pain.\n\nCERSEI: Shame.\n\nCERSEI take hold of the door and closes it behind her.\n\nCERSEI: Shame.\n\nSEPTA UNELLA screams.\n\nCERSEI: Shame.\n\nCERSEI closes the latch on the door s porthole and walks away. SEPTA UNELLA screams.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - TOMMEN S CHAMBER\n\nTOMMEN is staring out the window.\n\nATTENDANT: I m very sorry, Your Grace. Very sorry.\n\nThe attendant exits. TOMMEN takes his crown off his head and walks to another part of the room. He returns to the window, stands up on the sill, and plummets off the edge.\nINT. THE TWINSA banquet is underway. WALDER FREY is making a toast. JAIME and BRONN sit at the tables with the Frey and Lannister men, listening.\n\nWALDER: For House Lannister!\n\nMEN: Hear me roar!\n\nThe men cheer.\n\nWALDER: For House Frey!\n\nMEN: We stand together!\n\nThe men cheer.\n\nWALDER: May we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last.\n\nThe men cheer.\n\nWALDER: And when we drive our swords through our enemies  hearts, may we speak the words of our alliance,  The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards. \n\nThe men cheer. A handmaiden looks at BRONN and then at JAIME.\n\nBRONN: You don t even have to do anything, do you?\n\nJAIME looks at the handmaiden.\n\nBRONN: You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking.\n\nJAIME: You re welcome to her.\n\nBRONN: She doesn t want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.\n\nJAIME nods at two women standing on the other side of the room.\n\nJAIME: Those two have their eyes on you.\n\nBRONN looks at the women.\n\nBRONN: They have their eyes on you, cunt.\n\nJAIME: Not my type.\n\nBRONN: Not blonde enough?\n\nJAIME: Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay.\n\nJAIME looks at BRONN.\n\nJAIME: There you go.\n\nBRONN: Maybe I m not in the mood.\n\nThe girls approach Bronn.\n\nBRONN: Fuck it.\n\nBRONN stands and approaches the girls.\n\nBRONN: No need to call me ser just because I m an anointed knight.\n\nWALDER sits down next to JAIME.\n\nWALDER: This came together rather well. Your father would be pleased.\n\nJAIME: I m sure he would be.\n\nWALDER: Edmure is back in a cell. Can t go killing my son by law. It wouldn t be right. Give the family a bad name.\n\nWALDER sips his wine.\n\nWALDER: So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said.\n\nJAIME: Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?\n\nWALDER: I m a bit old for all that.\n\nJAIME: No, but back in your day.\n\nWALDER: The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn t it?\n\n\nJAIME nods.\n\nWALDER: I ve defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it s mine. What do you call that? Victory.\n\nJAIME: Yes, you re a great conqueror.\n\nWALDER: Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you re an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn t matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it s like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don t mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing.\n\nJAIME: They don t fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?\n\nJAIME stands and exits. WALDER watches him go.\n\nINT. RED KEEP - QYBURN S LAB\n\nCERSEI and QYBURN are standing over TOMMEN s body. His body is covered in a veil.\n\nCERSEI: Show me.\n\nQYBURN: Your Grace, there s no need--\n\nCERSEI: Show me.\n\nQYBURN uncovers TOMMEN s body. CERSEI stares at it.\n\nQYBURN: What are your thoughts concerning the king s funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?\n\nCERSEI: He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.\nEXT. OLDTOWN - OUTSKIRTSA horse-drawn carriage moves down the road, then stops. SAM and GILLY emerge from behind it. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM. They walk to a nearby hill look out over a lake. Oldtown stands across the lake. SAM and GILLY marvel at it.\n\nCUT TO: THE CITADEL\n\nSAM and GILLY enter and walk to the front desk. A maester is sitting behind the desk, holding spectacles up to his eyes and reading.\n\nSAM: Hello.\n\nThe maester keeps reading and then looks up at SAM, removing his spectacles.\n\nSAM: From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.\n\nSAM holds up a letter. The maester puts down his spectacles and opens his palm. SAM reaches across the table with the letter, offering it to the maester. The maester does not retrieve it. SAM presses himself against the desk, leans further in, and places the letter directly in the maester s hand. The maester takes the letter, breaks the seal, and reads it.\n\nSAM: I m-- I m to be the new maester.\n\nThe maester looks at SAM and then opens a large book. He flips a few pages.\n\nMAESTER: Oh.\n\nThe maester points his finger to a line of text on the open page.\n\nMAESTER: According to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.\n\nSAM: He died.\n\nMAESTER: We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.\n\nSAM: Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He s since passed away. Which is why I m here.\n\nMAESTER: This is irregular.\n\nSAM: Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular.\n\nThe maester stares blankly at SAM, then picks up a quill and crosses off two lines of text in the open book.\n\nMAESTER: The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you. In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library. Follow me.\n\nThe maester stands and begins walking away. SAM and GILLY start to follow him. He turns back and looks at GILLY.\n\nMAESTER:  No women or children!\n\nThe maester turns and walks away. SAM makes several baffled gestures to GILLY and then follows the maester. They enter a small hallway full of books. The maester stops in front of a dark side passage and gestures towards it. SAM starts down the passage. The maester leaves. On his way through, SAM touches several of the books lining the shelves. SAM emerges onto the other side of the passage. The passage opens onto an enormous library with a chandelier dangling from the ceiling that reflects light. SAM gets teary and smiles.\nEXT. WINTERFELL - OUTSKIRTSA white raven flies over the Northern wilderness towards Winterfell.\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL - DINING HALL\n\nJON SNOW is standing behind the high table, staring across the hall. MELISANDRE stands by his side.\n\nJON SNOW: When we had feasts, our family would sit up here  and I d sit down there.\n\nJON SNOW points to the other end of the hall.\n\nMELISANDRE: Could have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts.\n\nJON SNOW chuckles.\n\nJON SNOW: Aye, you re right. I was luckier than most.\n\nDAVOS enters the hall and tosses the charred stag statuette at MELISANDRE. MELISANDRE catches it.\n\nJON SNOW: What is that?\n\nDAVOS: Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.\n\nMELISANDRE: The Princess Shireen.\n\nDAVOS: Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!\n\nMELISANDRE: We burned her at the stake.\n\nDAVOS: Why?\n\nMELISANDRE: The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.\n\nDAVOS: You burned a little girl alive!\n\nMELISANDRE: I only do what my Lord commands!\n\nDAVOS: If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!\n\nMELISANDRE: We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.\n\nDAVOS: I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!\n\nMELISANDRE: So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.\n\nDAVOS: The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied.\n\nMELISANDRE: I didn t lie. I was wrong.\n\nDAVOS: Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?\n\nDAVOS and MELISANDRE stare at each other in silence.\n\nDAVOS (to JON SNOW): I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.\n\nJON SNOW (to MELISANDRE): Do you have anything to say for yourself?\n\nMELISANDRE: I ve been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he s not. You ve seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war.\n\nJON SNOW approaches MELISANDRE.\n\nJON SNOW: Ride south today. If you return to the North, I ll have you hanged as a murderer.\n\nMELISANDRE puts the stag statuette down on the high table and begins to walk away. DAVOS moves in her way.\n\nDAVOS: If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself.\n\nMELISANDRE moves past DAVOS and exits.\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL\n\nJON SNOW stands atop the outer wall watching MELISANDRE ride south on her horse. SANSA appears.\n\nJON SNOW: I m having the lord s chamber prepared for you.\n\nSANSA: Mother and Father s room? You should take it.\n\nJON SNOW: I m not a Stark.\n\nSANSA: You are to me.\n\nJON SNOW: You re the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We re standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.\n\nSANSA: He did.\n\nJON SNOW: And you trust him?\n\nSANSA: Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I m sorry.\n\nJON SNOW approaches SANSA.\n\nJON SNOW: We need to trust each other. We can t fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.\n\nJON SNOW touches SANSA s face and kisses her on the forehead, then turns to walk away.\n\nSANSA: Jon.\n\nJON SNOW turns back to face SANSA.\n\nSANSA: A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.\n\nJON SNOW smiles and looks up at the sky.\n\nJON SNOW: Well, Father always promised, didn t he?\n\nJON SNOW exits. SANSA looks out at the wilderness.\nEXT. SUNSPEAR - COURTYARDELLARIA SAND and OLENNA TYRELL are sitting across a table from each other. OBARA SAND, NYMERIA SAND, and TYENE SAND flank ELLARIA.\n\nOLENNA: The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?\n\nELLARIA: You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna.\n\nOLENNA: You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?\n\nOBARA: We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?\n\nOLENNA: What is your name again? Barbaro?\n\nOBARA: Obara.\n\nOLENNA: Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don t presume to tell me what I need.\n\nNYMERIA: Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--\n\nOLENNA: Do shut up, dear.\n\nOLENNA looks at TYENE.\n\nOLENNA: Anything from you?\n\nTYENE opens her mouth to speak.\n\nOLENNA: No? Good. Let the grown women speak.\n\nELLARIA: The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.\n\nOLENNA: Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I m after now.\n\nELLARIA: You re absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart s desire.\n\nELLARIA rings a bell.\n\nOLENNA: And what is my heart s desire?\n\nELLARIA: Vengeance. Justice.\n\nVARYS emerges from a hallway.\n\nVARYS: Fire and blood.\nINT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOMDAENERYS is sitting on a couch, sipping a glass of wine. DAARIO enters.\n\nDAARIO: Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.\n\nDAARIO pours himself a glass of wine.\n\nDAARIO: I m curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.\n\nDAENERYS: You re not coming with us.\n\nDAARIO: New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King s Landing.\n\nDAARIO approaches DAENERYS and stands in front of her.\n\nDAENERYS: You re not going to Westeros. You re staying here with the Second Sons. There s finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.\n\nDAARIO sets his glass of wine down on a table.\n\nDAARIO: Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I m here for you, not them.\n\nDAENERYS: You promised me.  My sword is yours. My life is yours.  This is what I command. If I m going to rule in Westeros, I ll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage.\n\nDAARIO sits down.\n\nDAARIO: Who are you marrying this time?\n\nDAENERYS: I don t know. Maybe no one.\n\nDAARIO: But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?\n\nDAENERYS: I can t bring a lover to Westeros.\n\nDAARIO: A king wouldn t think twice about it.\n\nDAENERYS: So that s what you want? To be my mistress?\n\nDAARIO: I m not proud. I don t care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don t want a crown. I want you.\n\nDAARIO approaches DAENERYS and kneels in front of her.\n\nDAARIO: I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.\n\nDAENERYS touches DAARIO s face.\n\nDAENERYS: I can t.\n\nDAARIO stands.\n\nDAARIO: The dwarf told you to do this.\n\nDAENERYS: No one tells me to do anything.\n\nDAARIO: Clever fellow. Can t argue with his logic. I m no use to you over there.\n\nDAENERYS: Don t get angry.\n\nDAARIO: I m not angry. I m full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?\n\nDAENERYS: A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.\n\nDAENERYS stands.\n\nDAARIO: Bay of Dragons?\n\nDAENERYS: We can t call it Slaver s Bay anymore, can we?\n\nDAARIO: You ll get that throne you want so badly, I m sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness.\n\nDAARIO sips his wine.\n\nDAARIO: I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what s coming for them.\n\nDAENERYS: Farewell, Daario Naharis.\n\nDAARIO nods and exits.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM\n\nTYRION is sitting off to the side of the room on a bench. DAENERYS enters, walking down the steps from the throne.\n\nTYRION: How did he take it?\n\nDAENERYS: No tears.\n\nTYRION: I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it s any consolation.\n\nDAENERYS reaches the bottom of the steps and approaches TYRION.\n\nDAENERYS: It s not.\n\nTYRION: No, I suppose not. I m terrible at consoling.\n\nDAENERYS sits down on the bench next to TYRION.\n\nDAENERYS: Yes, you really are.\n\nTYRION: All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It s all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?\n\nDAENERYS nods.\n\nTYRION: Good. You re in the great game now. And the great game s terrifying. The only people who aren t afraid of failure are madmen like your father.\n\nDAENERYS: Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.\n\nTYRION: He wasn t the first to love you and he won t be the last.\n\nDAENERYS: Well, you have completely failed to console me.\n\nDAENERYS stands and turns to face TYRION.\n\nTYRION: For what it s worth, I ve been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone s always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am.\n\nTYRION stands on the bench.\n\nTYRION: I believe in you. It s embarrassing, really. I d swear you my sword, but I don t actually own a sword.\n\nDAENERYS: It s your counsel I need.\n\nTYRION: It s yours. Now and always.\n\nDAENERYS: Good. I, um  I had something made for you. I m not sure if it s right.\n\nDAENERYS pins a Hand of the King s brooch on TYRION s chest.\n\nDAENERYS: Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen.\n\nTYRION holds back tears, then kneels.\nINT. THE TWINSWALDER FREY is sitting at the high table, eating and drinking. The rest of the dining hall is empty. A handmaiden approaches and sets down a platter of pie on the table in front of him.\n\nWALDER: You re not one of mine, are you?\n\nHANDMAIDEN: No, my lord.\n\nWALDER: Didn t think so. Too pretty.\n\nWALDER slaps the handmaiden on the buttocks and smiles.\n\nWALDER: Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.\n\nHANDMAIDEN: They re here, my lord.\n\nWALDER: Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now.\n\nHANDMAIDEN: But they re already here, my lord.\n\nWALDER looks around the hall. The handmaiden points to the pie.\n\nHANDMAIDEN: Here, my lord.\n\nWALDER pulls back the top layer of the pie. A finger protrudes from the center of the slice.\n\nHANDMAIDEN: They weren t easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.\n\nWALDER breathes heavily.\n\nWALDER: What \n\nThe handmaiden reaches up to her face and pulls it away, revealing her true identity is ARYA.\n\nARYA: My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you re ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.\n\nARYA brandishes a knife. WALDER gets up to run, but ARYA grabs him and pulls him back down. She grabs him by the forehead and slits his throat. He convulses and groans as he dies. ARYA smiles and stares at him.\nEXT. WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREESANSA sits underneath the weirwood tree. PETYR approaches her.\n\nPETYR: Forgive me, my lady  if you re at prayer.\n\nSANSA: I m done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had.\n\nSANSA stands and walks towards PETYR.\n\nSANSA: I was a stupid girl.\n\nPETYR: You were a child.\n\nSANSA: What do you want?\n\nPETYR: I thought you knew what I wanted.\n\nSANSA: I was wrong.\n\nPETYR: No, you weren t. Every time I m faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne  and you by my side.\n\nPETYR leans in to kiss SANSA, but SANSA puts her hand on his chest to stop him.\n\nSANSA: It s a pretty picture.\n\nSANSA walks past PETYR.\n\nPETYR: News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I ve declared for House Stark for all to hear.\n\nSANSA: You ve declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It s never stopped you from serving yourself.\n\nPETYR: The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?\n\nSANSA exits.\nEXT. BEYOND THE WALLBENJEN stares up at The Wall. BRAN and MEERA wait nearby.\n\nBENJEN: This is where I leave you.\n\nMEERA: You re not coming with us?\n\nBENJEN: The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass.\n\nBENJEN approaches his horse and lifts BRAN off of it. He carries BRAN to the foot of a nearby weirwood, then walks back to his horse.\n\nMEERA: Where will you go?\n\nBENJEN: The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I ll do what I can  as long as I can.\n\nBENJEN mounts his horse.\n\nBRAN: Thank you, Uncle Benjen.\n\nBENJEN: I wish you both good fortune.\n\nBENJEN rides away. BRAN looks at the weirwood and then starts to crawl towards it. MEERA helps him. BRAN reaches out to the weirwood but MEERA grabs his wrist.\n\nMEERA: Are you sure you re ready for this?\n\nBRAN:I m the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this.\n\nBRAN touches the weirwood tree.\nEXT. VISION OF THE PAST - TOWER OF JOYNED stands at the base of the Tower of Joy. He heards LYANNA screaming in the Tower and rushes towards the stairs. BRAN stands on the ground behind him. NED turns back as though he hears a noise, but sees nothing. He hurries up the steps. BRAN follows. NED bursts through a door into a bedroom. LYANNA lies in bed. The sheets are soaked with blood. A handmaiden is standing in the corner.\n\nLYANNA: Ned?\n\nNED: Lyanna.\n\nNED rushes to LYANNA s side.\n\nLYANNA: Is that you? Is that really you?\n\nLYANNA lifts her hand. NED takes it.\n\nLYANNA: You re not a dream.\n\nNED: No, I m not a dream. I m here. Right here.\n\nLYANNA: I ve missed you, big brother.\n\nNED begins to cry.\n\nNED: I ve missed you, too.\n\nLYANNA: I want to be brave.\n\nNED: Shh. You are.\n\nLYANNA: I m not.\n\nNED lifts his hand from LYANNA s stomach. His palm is covered in blood.\n\nLYANNA: I don t want to die.\n\nNED: You re not going to die.\n\nNED looks at the handmaiden.\n\nNED: Get her some water!\n\nLYANNA: No, no water.\n\nNED: Is there a maester?\n\nLYANNA: Please. Listen to me, Ned.\n\nLYANNA whispers in NED s ear.\n\nLYANNA: If Robert finds out, he ll kill him, you know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me.\n\nThe handmaiden hands NED the child.\n\nLYANNA: Promise me, Ned. Promise me.\n\nNED stares down at the baby. The baby opens its eyes. Zoom on the baby s face.\nINT. WINTERFELL - DINING HALLSlow zoom out from JON SNOW s face. JON SNOW is sitting at high table. SANSA sits beside him. Representatives from Northern houses, the Vale, and the wildlings are gathered in the dining hall. TORMUND and DAVOS sit among the wildlings. PETYR stands off to the side, watching.\n\nVALE KNIGHT: You can t expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.\n\nTORMUND: We didn t invade. We were invited.\n\nVALE KNIGHT: Not by me.\n\nJON SNOW stands.\n\nJON SNOW: The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.\n\nOne of the houses  representatives stands.\n\nMAN: The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it ll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.\n\nJON SNOW: The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won t wait out the storm. He brings the storm.\n\nThe men begin to murmur. LYANNA MORMONT stands.\n\nLYANNA: Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don t care if he s a bastard. Ned Stark s blood runs through his veins. He s my king from this day until his last day.\n\nThe men resume murmuring. LORD MANDERLY stands.\n\nMANDERLY: Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn t think we d find another king in my lifetime. I didn t commit my men to your cause  cause I didn t want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North.\n\nMANDERLY draws his blade, then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels. LORD GLOVER stands.\n\nGLOVER: I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.\n\nJON SNOW: There s nothing to forgive, my lord.\n\nGLOVER: There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow  the King in the North!\n\nGLOVER draws his blade, then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels.\n\nGLOVER: The King in the North!\n\nEveryone in the hall stands and draws their blades.\n\nALL: The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!\n\nJON SNOW stands. SANSA and PETYR look at each other.\nEXT. KING S LANDING - OUTSKIRTSJAIME, BRONN, and several Lannister knights are riding on horseback on a high hill. They stop and look out at King s Landing.

Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!\n\nED: I didn't say it was alright!

A hundred and two.\n\nPYP: How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?\n\nED: Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back.\n\n[Everyone takes a drink]\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN\n\n[Men and women are seen swimming in a lake. They're bathing and washing clothes. Grey Worm looks over at Missandei who is naked. Missandei sees him looking, he looks away ashamed then looks back. She stands up proudly, then covers up. He dunks his head under water]\n\nDANY: You think he was spying on you?\n\nMISSANDEI: No, not spying.\n\nDANY: The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.\n\nMISSANDEI: Yes your grace.\n\nDANY: But you are not Dothraki.\n\nMISSANDEI: No.\n\nDANY: Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes.\n\nMISSANDEI: He was interested.\n\nDANY: What?\n\nMISSANDEI: I believe he was interested.\n\nDANY: When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?\n\nMISSANDEI: All of it?\n\nDANY: The...the pillar an the stones.\n\nMISSANDEI: I don't know, your grace.\n\nDANY: Haven't you ever wondered?\n\nMISSANDEI: Yes, your grace.\n\n[Missandei is seen walking up toward Dany's throne. Grey Worm enters]\n\nGREY WORM: Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.\n\nMISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.\n\nGREY WORM: *in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.\n\nMISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* No.\n\nGREY WORM: The lessons you give I [?] on. These are precious to I.\n\nMISSANDEI: To me.\n\nGREY WORM: To me.\n\nMISSANDEI: I don't remember teaching you the word precious.\n\nGREY WORM: Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word.\n\nMISSANDEI: Do you remember the name you were given at birth?\n\nGREY WORM: I remember nothing. Only unsullied.\n\nMISSANDEI: When they cut you, do you remember that?\n\n[Grey Worm shakes his head no]\n\nMISSANDEI: I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.\n\nGREY WORM: Why? Why sorry?\n\nMISSANDEI: It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.\n\nGREY WORM: *approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry.\n\n[Grey Worm turns around and begins to walk away]\n\nMISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* Grey Worm.\n\n[Grey Worm stops and turns around]\n\nMISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.\n\nGREY WORM: *in Valyrian* So am I.\n\n[Grey Worm turns and walks out of the throne room]\n\nCUT TO: MOAT CAILIN\n\nRAMSAY: Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?\n\nTHEON: I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands.\n\nRAMSAY: And what are you really?\n\nTHEON: I'm Reek.\n\nRAMSAY: Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud.\n\nTHEON: I'm Reek.\n\nRAMSAY: Until when?\n\nTHEON: Always. Forever.\n\nRAMSAY: That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.\n\n[Theon approaches the castle on horseback]\n\nGUARD 1: *to Theon* No closer. Who are you?\n\n[Theon enters the castle walls. Inside a lot of people are sick or dying]\n\nRALF: I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?\n\nTHEON: Yes.\n\nRALF: And why should I believe that?\n\nTHEON: I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.\n\nEVERYONE: What is dead may never die.\n\nRALF: And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?\n\nTHEON: Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.\n\nRALF: And what does Lord Bolton want?\n\n[Theon hands Kenning a scroll]\n\nTHEON: You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.\n\nRALF: He wants us to surrender?\n\nTHEON: My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you.\n\n[Kenning falls to the ground. His men pick him up]\n\nRALF: ...shame fought with honor.\n\nTHEON: I'm sorry, I didn't hear...\n\n[Kenning spits blood in Theon's face]\n\nRALF: No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?\n\nTHEON: *scared* You don't know.\n\nRALF: The Ironborn will not surrender.\n\nTHEON: *whispering* Reek. Reek.\n\nRALF: You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?\n\n[MAN 4 kills Kenning with an axe]\n\nTHEON: Reek.\n\nMAN 4: If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?\n\nTHEON: Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.\n\n[Cut to MAN 4's body with no skin and his eye cut out]\n\nRAMSAY: You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?\n\nTHEON: Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?\n\nRAMSAY: I believe we will. To our new home.\n\nCUT TO: THE VALE\n\nYou have foreign blood, don't you, Baelish?\n\nPETYR: A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.\n\nLORD ROYCE: Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.\n\nPETYR: The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce.\n\nLORD ROYCE: She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black.\n\nPETYR: My lord...\n\nLORD ROYCE: And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn...\n\nPETYR: Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.\n\nLADY ANYA: Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair.\n\nPETYR: Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.\n\nLADY ANYA: She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.\n\nLORD ROYCE: Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door.\n\nPETYR: She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.\n\nLORD ROYCE: We were told there was a witness. A girl.\n\nLADY ANYA: A niece of yours, I believe.\n\nPETYR: A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help.\n\nLORD ROYCE: We'd like to speak with her.\n\nPETYR: Let me fetch her.\n\nLADY ANYA: No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.\n\n[Sansa Stark enters the room]\n\nLADY ANYA: Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.\n\nPETYR: My lady...\n\nLADY ANYA: I wasn't asking you.\n\nSANSA: He can stay.\n\nLORD ROYCE: Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw.\n\nSANSA: *to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything.\n\nLADY ANYA: Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.\n\nSANSA: My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.\n\nLORD ROYCE: Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?\n\nSANSA: Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.\n\nSER VANCE: Your secret is safe with us, my lady.\n\nLORD ROYCE: Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.\n\nLADY ANYA: Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.\n\nSANSA: You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me.\n\nLORD ROYCE: Lady Sansa.\n\nSANSA: It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*\n\nLADY ANYA: Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault.\n\n[Sansa looks up at Petyr]\n\n[Lord Royce, Lady Anya, and Petyr walk down the stairs]\n\nLORD ROYCE: You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.\n\nLADY ANYA: Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.\n\nLORD ROYCE: Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly.\n\nPETYR: You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same.\n\nLADY ANYA: Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?\n\nPETYR: For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl.\n\nLORD ROYCE: Are you questioning our courage?\n\nPETYR: I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?\n\nLORD ROYCE: Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.\n\nPETYR: No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?\n\nLADY ANYA: Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead.\n\nPETYR: I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale.\n\nLADY ANYA: Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.\n\nPETYR: And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.\n\nLADY ANYA: More often they die young.\n\nPETYR: I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse.\n\nLORD ROYCE: Aye, it's time.\n\nPETYR: Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN\n\nBOY: Ser Barristan.\n\nSER BARRISTAN: Yes? Who sent you?\n\n[A boy hands a scroll to Ser Barristan. He reads it]\n\n[Ser Jorah is looking at a map by the water alone]\n\nSER JORAH: Ser Barristan.\n\nSER BARRISTAN: Ser Jorah.\n\nSER JORAH: Have I forgotten a council meeting?\n\nSER BARRISTAN: No.\n\n[Ser Barristan hands Ser Jorah the scroll]\n\nSER JORAH: What's this?\n\nSER BARRISTAN: A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.\n\nSER JORAH: Who gave you this?\n\nSER BARRISTAN: Does it matter?\n\nSER JORAH: Have you told her?\n\nSER BARRISTAN: I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back.\n\nSER JORAH: Let me speak with her in private.\n\nSER BARRISTAN: You'll never be alone with her again.\n\n[Ser Barristan leaves]\n\n[Ser Jorah enters Dany's throne room, walking toward her]\n\nDANY: Why did the usurper pardon you?\n\nSER JORAH: If we could speak alone.\n\nDANY: No, speak to me here. Explain it to me.\n\nSER JORAH: Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him.\n\nDANY: The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.\n\nSER JORAH: It is not forged.\n\nDANY: Why, then?\n\nSER JORAH: I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing.\n\nDANY: What was the content of these letters?\n\nSER JORAH: Information.\n\nDANY: What information?\n\nSER JORAH: When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.\n\nDANY: You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?\n\nSER JORAH: I...\n\nDANY: Yes or no?\n\nSER JORAH: Khaleesi.\n\nDANY: Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?\n\nSER JORAH: Yes.\n\nDANY: That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.\n\nSER JORAH: I stopped you from drinking his wine.\n\nDANY: Because you knew it was poisoned.\n\nSER JORAH: I suspected.\n\nDANY: You betrayed me from the first.\n\nSER JORAH: Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me.\n\nDANY: You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...\n\nSER JORAH: I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.\n\nDANY: ...and you want me to forgive you?\n\nSER JORAH: I have loved you.\n\nDANY: Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can.\n\nSER JORAH: Daenerys, please.\n\n[Ser Jorah goes for Dany's hand]\n\nDANY: Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now.\n\n[Ser Jorah rides away from Mereen]\n\nCUT TO: MOAT CAILIN\n\n[Ramsay is seen holding a flag out to Lord Bolton]\n\nRAMSAY: Moat Cailin is yours, Father.\n\nLORD BOLTON: Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?\n\nRAMSAY: No.\n\nRAMSAY: Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see.\n\nRAMSAY: Moors, fields, hills.\n\nRAMSAY: Tell me what you see.\n\nRAMSAY: Nothing.\n\nROOSE: Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?\n\nRAMSAY: Ramsay Snow.\n\nROOSE: No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.\n\nRAMSAY: You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise.\n\n[The Bolton army rides forward on horseback]\n\nRAMSAY: Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.\n\nCUT TO: THE VALE\n\n[Sansa is seen sitting on her bed sewing. Petyr knocks on her door]\n\nSANSA: Yes?\n\nPETYR: First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?\n\nSANSA: They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.\n\nPETYR: That's not an answer.\n\nSANSA: If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?\n\nPETYR: I don't know.\n\nSANSA: Neither do I.\n\nPETYR: Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?\n\nSANSA: I know what you want.\n\nPETYR: Do you?\n\n[She looks up at him]\n\nCUT TO: OUTSIDE THE VALE\n\n[Arya and the Hound approach the Vale]\n\nHOUND: I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy.\n\nARYA: Lots of things make me happy.\n\nHOUND: Like what?\n\nARYA: Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.\n\nHOUND: So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?\n\nARYA: At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.\n\nHOUND: Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.\n\nARYA: You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?\n\nHOUND: I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel.\n\nARYA: That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.\n\nHOUND: *laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*\n\nARYA: You should have let me burn it.\n\nHOUND: It's a fleabite.\n\nARYA: That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.\n\nHOUND: Well, we won't have to walk too much further.\n\nARYA: You really think my aunt will pay for me?\n\nHOUND: Aye, she'll pay.\n\nARYA: I've never even met her.\n\nHOUND: Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about.\n\nARYA: I'm not a lady.\n\nGUARD: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?\n\nHOUND: The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.\n\nGUARD: Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.\n\n[Arya bursts out laughing]\n\nCUT TO: THE VALE\n\n[Petyr is walking down the stairs with Robin]\n\nROBIN: I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave.\n\nPETYR: You shouldn't be.\n\nROBIN: The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside.\n\nPETYR: It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.\n\n[Sansa enters the scene and walks down the stairs, Petyr looks at her]\n\nSANSA: Shall we go?\n\nCUT TO: KING'S LANDING\n\n[In prison, Tyrion drinks wine from Jaime]\n\nTYRION: Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?\n\nJAIME: Soon.\n\nTYRION: Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?\n\nJAIME: I've never seen him fight.\n\nTYRION: Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.\n\nJAIME: Oberyn believes in himself.\n\nTYRION: That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?\n\nJAIME: Beheading.\n\nTYRION: Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.\n\nJAIME: Cousins.\n\nTYRION: Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?\n\nJAIME: Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.\n\nTYRION: Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.\n\nTOGETHER: Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!\n\nTYRION: Nothing made him happier.\n\nJAIME: Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.\n\nTYRION: On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.\n\nJAIME: The joke wore thin, though.\n\nTYRION: For you. You drifted away.\n\nJAIME: I had other interests.\n\nTYRION: Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.\n\nJAIME: Why?\n\nTYRION: I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. \"Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?\" He gave me an answer. \"Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!\" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.\n\nJAIME: Volarik. Tried to touch me once.\n\nTurns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of \"khuu, khuu, khuu\". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard \"khuu, khuu, khuu\" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.\n\nJAIME: Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?\n\nTYRION: I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.\n\nJAIME: He was twice your size.\n\nTYRION: He just pushed me aside with a \"khuu\" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?\n\nJAIME: I don't know.\n\n[Bells begin chiming in the distance. Jaime goes to leave]\n\nJAIME: Good luck today.\n\n[Tyrion walks out toward the arena. The Lannisters are there, Oberyn is there getting ready for the battle. Tyrion passes him in handcuffs]\n\nTYRION: Looks like very light armor.\n\nOBERYN: I like to move around.\n\nTYRION: You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.\n\nOBERYN: You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.\n\nTYRION: It could get you killed. It could get me killed.\n\nOBERYN: Today is not the day I die.\n\nELLARIA: You're going to fight that?\n\nOBERYN: I'm going to kill that.\n\nELLARIA: He is the biggest man I've ever seen.\n\nOBERYN: Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.\n\nTYRION: Thank the gods.\n\nPYCELL: In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion...\n\n[Tywin speeds the process along in boredom. Horns sound to start the fight. Oberyn kisses Ellaria]\n\nELLARIA: Don't leave me alone in this world.\n\nOBERYN: Never.\n\n[Oberyn is tossed his weapon. He's very good with it. The crowd cheers]\n\nOBERYN: Have they told you who I am?\n\nMOUNTAIN: Some dead man.\n\n[The Mountain lunges forward as the battle begins]\n\nOBERYN: I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.\n\nOBERYN: I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.\n\nOBERYN: Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.\n\nOBERYN: You raped her! You murdered her!

I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it. When I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. How did you kill those guards? Show me how. If you would learn, you must come with me. I want to, but I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. You have to go. Go to the Wall, to Jon. Osha, you must protect them. You're the only one who can. Karstark: 200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep. The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons. They rot in the ground while their killer runs free. Those were Stark men. I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Cersei: Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom this morning. Margaery: I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about. Not long ago we were attacked by a mob there. The king barely escaped with his life. My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. You said you'd take me home. If you were to tell just one... Please, Lord Baelish, tell me what to do. Tell me when. Ros: Watch out for her. Watch out for her with him. ( snarls ) Sam: Ah! ( Ghost growling ) We need to get back to the Wall. We know what's out there, but we have to warn them. ( theme music playing ) ( panting ) ( wind blowing ) ( caws ) ( caws ) Don't think too much, Bran. Relax your bow arm. ( caws ) ( laughing ) Ned: And which one of you was a marksman at 10? Father? ( raven caws ) You can't kill it, you know. Why not? Because the raven is you. ( raven caws ) ( gasps ) Hodor. It's all right, Hodor. ( sighs ) Hodor. Osha: Were you inside the wolf again, little lord? No, it was the three-eyed raven. He's back. I tried to kill it, but I couldn't. There was a boy. I don't want to hear about it. But you asked. We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them. I didn't ask for black magic dreams. I know you didn't, little lord. ( birds screeching ) We need to move. We don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive. And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you? No. Some good he is, then. I don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off. My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds. Did you ever think you'd marry one? I never thought I'd marry anyone at all. Never? Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians. ( door opens ) Pardon me, Your Grace. My queen. Lord Bolton. Let me guess which one is the good news. Word from Riverrun and Winterfell. ( crying ) I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many. We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return. Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest? Something else? By the time Bolton's b*st*rd got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages. Have you received any demands? Have you heard anything from Theon at all? ( gasps ) ( shivering ) Where am I? Who are you? What do you want? I want to do this. ( screaming ) Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests? Yes. ( sheep bleating ) So how shall we pass the time? By putting one foot in front of the other. It's going to be a very dull walk. I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine. You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword. If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman. All the good it's done her. ( moans ) How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about. Not your concern, Kingslayer. It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell. How would you know? Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways. Move. Were you pledged to Stannis? Gods, no. Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal. Shut your mouth. Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you. I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king. Sounds like you quite fancied him. I did not fancy him. Oh, gods, you did. Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid. He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him. I'm not interested in foul rumors. Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it. Shut your mouth! I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love. ( horse snorts ) Where are you headed, then? Jaime: South. You? Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win. No, you really can't. Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but... ( laughs ) I wouldn't tangle with you. ( laughs ) Seven blessings to you. And you. Jaime: He knows who I am. He doesn't. Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone? We're not doing it. He's an innocent man. More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters? Make it tighter here. That's better. It makes you look very strong. No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others. Yes, Your Grace. Bloody flowers. On the king. Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric. Tell me what you think of her. Who? Margaery. She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century. It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent. Yes, she is. Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting. Not to me. ( chuckles ) I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself ... This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had. Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason. She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do ... what they're told. You need to ask yourself ... I don't need to do anything. ( sighs ) Better. Much better. I still don't believe it. He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother. Men only want one thing from a pretty girl. Littlefinger's not in love with me. Love is not the thing he wants. He's too old. They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...? No. If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me. Why? What will you do? I will make him stop. ( knocks ) Guard: Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady. Send him in. Lady Sansa. Ser Loras. My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens. May I escort you to them? I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa. You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose. Of course I did. Margaery: It's more your color. You take it. Thank you. You're such a dear. I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa. Thank you, Ser Loras. Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother... the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell. Kiss me, child. It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses. And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant. Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king. Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras. Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father ... Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us? She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes? Lemon cake's my favorite. So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others. Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden? I haven't had the pleasure. No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now... I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey. I... I... You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you? Has he ripped out your tongue? Joff ... King Joffrey, he ... His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion. Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand? I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means. ( footsteps approaching ) Bring me some cheese. The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady. The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now. Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you. My father always told the truth. Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head. Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it. Go on. I ... I can't. I never meant ... my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore. She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her. Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it. He's a monster. Ah. That's a pity. Please, don't stop the wedding. Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese. ( panting ) Karstark: We're at war. This march is a distraction. My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction. Are we riding to battle at Riverrun? No. Then it's a distraction. My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men. Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference. Have you lost faith in our cause? If it's revenge, I still got faith in it. If you no longer believe ... I can believe till it snows in Dorne. Don't change the fact that we've got half the men. You don't think we can win? May I speak my mind, Your Grace? Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark? I think you lost this war the day you married her. ( horse whinnies ) Whoa, whoa. Your Grace. You're afraid of her. And she knows it. I'm not afraid of her. ( snorting ) May I help you, Lady Stark? No. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have ... You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them. You've made them before? Twice. Did they work? After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall. Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering. Which boy? Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us. And he lived. And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then... all this horror that's come to my family... it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child. Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand? Yes. You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people. I understand. Well, how could you understand? You want to protect your people. Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army? No. I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth. Shouldn't be long now. ( screeching ) What's wrong with him? Mance: He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us. What, you've never met a warg? ( screeching ) Mance: Orell. ( shivers ) Where were you this time? The Fist of the First Men. What did you see? ( chuckles ) Dead crows. ( men coughing ) Rast: What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to. Hey. Get up, Sam. No. Get up. I can't. If you stop, you'll die. 'Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too. You don't care. 'Course we care. You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me. Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow. We didn't want to die. ( Sam sobbing ) Help me get him up. Looks like that piggy is done for. Help us get him up. He's slowing us down. Just get him up! Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him. What is this? Get up, Tarly. Is he all right? Aye, I think so. If he can't, we may as well just go without him. That's enough. Tarly, I forbid you to die. Do you hear me? Why should the rest of us ... Rast... you're responsible for him. What am I supposed to do? Make sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on! I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me? ( branch snaps ) ( wolf growling ) Where's Rickon and Hodor? Looking for food. ( growling ) What's out there? ( growling ) ( growling ) Osha: Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood. I'm unarmed. That was poor planning. My sister carries the weapons. I'm better with them. Drop the spear. Drop it. If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits. ( growling ) You must be Summer. ( sniffing ) I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera. We've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go. Gendry: I'm just trying to understand. Arya: Would you please shut up about it? Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills. I'm not listening. But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey. Shut up. You could have picked Tywin Lannister. Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining? But you could have ended the war. Where are we going? North. If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now. Maybe we already passed it. It's 100 feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather's a lord. He'll protect us. ( man singing ) Could be a minstrel. Shut up. ? A lion still has claws... ? Hot Pie: A minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food. Shh. ? And so he spoke, and so he spoke ? ? That Lord of Castamere ? ? But now the rains ? ? Weep o'er his hall ? ? With no one there to hear. ? ( gasps ) Singer: What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf? Archer: Just a dirty little cub, I think. Singer: Loose a few more shafts. Don't. Put the sword down, girl. You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you. ( laughing ) Generous. You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy? What friends? The fat one to your left and the lad beside him. Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal? Arya: Who are you? Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy. No, who do you fight for? The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal. I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us. You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way. Here's the thing, fat boy. When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking. ( men laughing ) Half the country's starving and look at this one. Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving. My lion. We've spoken of this. You cannot come here. But you said I should come to you with any problems. Did anyone see you? No. You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain. All right. What is this problem? I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him. Baelish doesn't have friends. I don't know her name. Oh, Ros? The redhead? How do you know her? I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need. She's a whore. Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things. You f*cked her. Oh, please. All right, yes, I f*cked her once. Twice. But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else. And was she good? Did you like her? Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger? That Sansa shouldn't trust him. Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger? We have to protect her. We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name. A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty? Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing ... to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you. You pervert. You want her? This child? I don't even want to talk about her. But you are. Only because you're making me. ( chuckles ) I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out. This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair. \"Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me.\" Hmm, yes. Now do you think I'm cruel? Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again. Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people. ( moans ) ( knocks ) Guard: Lady Tyrell, my king. Send her in. You wanted to see me, Your Grace? I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left. That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want. Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp. A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady. And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady? Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all. What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it? The duty of any wife to any husband ... to provide him with children. You failed to do this. Why? I ... I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace. You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart? No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly... I don't believe he was interested in the company of women. What makes you say this? Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he ... he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something ... something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me. No, he was a known... degenerate. It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace. Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death. As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do. You are the king. Yes. I am. Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms. It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works? It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string. The bolt goes here. And then you just aim... and... ( laughs ) Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman. It's not unheard of. My father would never let me before ... You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it? May I? Please. I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there. Could you do it? Could you... kill something? I don't know, Your Grace. Do you think I could? Yes. Would you like to watch me? Yes. ( screams ) Stop! Stop! Tell us the truth. About what? ( screams ) I don't know what you want. I want the truth. What truth? Why'd you take Winterfell? I took it to ... I took it ... Who gave the orders? No one. I took it on my own. Why? To take the North while it was vulnerable. What were you going to do once you took it? Hold it. Rule it. Good. That's very good. ( screams ) Why did you do that? I told you. Why did you take Winterfell? I took it to bring glory to my house and my father. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them. What are you doing? Please. ( screaming ) I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off. ( door closes ) Your sister sent me. Yara? ( whimpers ) I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps. No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! ( sobbing ) Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go. Rickon, stay with us. It's all right. The wolves will protect him. You can get inside his head, see through his eyes. Only when I'm asleep. That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg. It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a ... A three-eyed raven? You've seen it? We saw him together. You haven't forgotten? Does it have anything to do with warging? No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight. Seeing things that haven't happened yet? Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away. What's he telling him? Why don't you ask? Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him? Where's the shame in that? Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting. Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping. When my father died, I dreamt it. You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I. You have the sight, too? When I told my father about your father... for the first time in my life, I saw him cry. Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah. He saved my father's life during the rebellion. Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too. What else have you seen? Only one thing that matters ... you. ( men laughing ) Thoros: I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand. I don't drink ale. There's no story so good a drink won't make it better. Yeah! You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children ... We're not children. How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal? Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory. A smith, eh? Where'd you train? King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop. That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city. That's because he's twice as good. Aha! A smith and a salesman. Gendry stole us weapons. Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see. He knows how to use a sword and so do I. ( men laugh ) My brothers taught me. ( men laugh ) Men: Ooh! ( men cheer ) To your brothers! ( cheering ) You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another. You'll free us? I gave you my word. But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your ... Hey, hey. ( men cheering ) Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person? One waits for him to drink until he passes out. Poor man. You have my sympathy. Aha, not a man at all. A Hound! ( men howl and bark ) So good to see you again, Clegane. Thoros? The f*ck you doing here? Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever. ( men laugh ) A pretty prize, lads. Men: Yeah! Girl. What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch? Jaime: It's a tough decision ... take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water. Silence, Kingslayer. Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river. Good luck. It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose? Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed. Be quick about it. ( Jaime groans ) I need to rest. Get up. I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them? Get up now. Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same sh1t boots for over a year. This heel is ruined. There's no way ... ( grunts ) ( chuckles ) I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords. ( sighs ) Ooh. You move well... for a great beast of a woman. You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game. Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you. You're good. Graceless, but good. See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there. ( grunting ) ( grunts ) ( panting ) ( groans, coughs ) ( Jaime breathing heavily ) ( horse neighs ) Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman. We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste. You sure he's the one? That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding. Give the man his silver. Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want. Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours.", "episode_23": "This march is a distraction. My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction. Are we riding to battle at Riverrun? No. Then it's a distraction. They're growing fast. Not fast enough. I need an army. We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world. The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. - Who are you? Thoros of Myr. Who do you fight for? The Brotherhood without Banners. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Your sister sent me. Yara? I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father. I will not fail you again. What's wrong with him? He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us. Orell, where were you this time? The Fist of the First Men. What did you see? Dead crows. Get up, Tarly. I forbid you to die. You're responsible for him. Make sure he gets back alive. So good to see you again, Clegane. Girl. What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch? Get up. Ah! Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want. Enough to buy me a new head? If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing ... Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him \"nephew.\" He is your king. Robb knows I meant him no disr ... You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag. My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around. It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you. I seized an opportunity. What value was the mill? The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it. Is he there now? Of course not. We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us. I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad dog without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill. We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister. Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old. Martyn is 15, I believe. Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace? No. Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons? No. How many men did you lose? 208. But for every man we lost, the Lannisters ... We need our men more than Tywin needs his! I'm sorry. I didn't know. You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient. We seem to be running short of patience here. You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister. Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it. What news of Jaime? 20,000 unwashed Northerners have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is? We are trying, my lord. Try harder. What do we have, then? Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name. Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn. For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord. Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been... positively predisposed toward me. A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale. Titles do seem to breed titles. You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him. Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended. Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin. Master of Coin? It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents. I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it. I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge. Hear, hear. ? He lifted her high in the air ? ? He sniffed and roared and smelled her there ? ? She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair ? ? But he licked the honey from her hair ? ? From there to here, from here to there ? ? All black and brown and covered with hair ? ? He smelled that girl in the summer air ? ? The bear, the bear and the maiden fair... ? I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us. You were armed when we were taken. I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound. All my life I've been hearing, \"Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.\" You were slower than I expected. And more predictable. I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year. And I'm a woman. I was still beating you. You were not beating me. Maybe you were as good as people said... once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name. When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist. Would I? They'll knock your teeth out. You think I care about my teeth? No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter? What does it matter? Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly. If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted? If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods. If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new. Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart. Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend? You're not our prisoner, little lady. What am I? Our guest. No one's put any chains on you. So I can walk away, then? These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. You're lucky we found you. You think you're good with that bow, you little twat? Better than anyone you've ever met. A coward's weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him. Why? So you can kiss him? You remember the last time you were here? Looks like every other sh1t inn on the road. Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more. Watch your head. Off we go. Walk up! What are you doing? We're about to leave. I'm staying. You're what? I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of Winterhell. Winterfell. You sure? I'm sure. Well, I made you something. What is it? It's a wolf. Yes, it is. That's the tail? Yeah. Well, be safe. Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed. You don't... burn your fingers. Good-bye, Hot Pie. Good-bye, Arry. Up you go, little lady. Hey, Hot Pie. It's really good. A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war. It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening. I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words ... Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience. I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end? After 30 years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name. Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. \"Wait for me, little Cat,\" he'd say. \"Wait for me and I'll come back to you.\" And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again. You mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him. You're Robb Stark's wife. Hold still. Is it true what they say about him? I don't know. What do they say about him? That he can turn into a wolf at night. True. And he eats the flesh of his enemies. True. You're a Lannister, aren't you? Martyn Lannister. Martyn Lannister. You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children. Unless it's a full moon. It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear. Always the artists. It's only horses. No men. You said there was dead crows. There was. How many men were here? About 300. And you know what those men are now? We're all the same to them ... meat for their army. Do you think anyone got away? It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and 20 good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not... throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly. We're finally going to war, old friend? Hide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night. They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side. We'll meet again. Aye. If you do your job. Ah. How will we see your signal? Send your eagle above the Wall every night. When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen. Ghost? What have we here? Frozen crows? We've come a long way. Smaller flock than you went north with. We can talk inside. Oh, can we? They need some water. Tether it and I'll be inside. Keep your eyes where they belong. They're not for you. Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us. Aye, pig's got value to me. You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in. I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man. You are a godly man? I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods. Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. And she's almost as fat as this one here. Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast. Here we are. Sharpen these for me, would ya? I see the head. Push. That's it. You're nearly there. One more push should do it. What is it? What is it? Keep quiet. If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance. I can ride. You're sure? Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you. I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this. We're not in the Iron Islands. Go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on back. You refuse to tell me where you're going? I don't know yet. The fires will show me. How long will you be gone? I don't know. You're abandoning me. I will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire. I am sworn to serve you. Then serve me. When I return, you will understand. My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son. I cannot. Why? You don't have the strength. It would kill you. I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years. I want you. Your fires burn low, my king. There is another way. A better way. You told me your magic requires a king's blood. Yes. I'm the one true king. You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it. The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace. To whom? To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did. Give me your water. Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death. Here, drink. Leave this place, Your Grace. Leave tonight, I beg you. And what is she to do for soldiers? We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr. Is it \"we\" already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done. The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents. How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan? Three. Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands? I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead. Do you disagree, Ser Barristan? When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him. Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died. Did you know him well, Ser Barristan? I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met. I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon. All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace? They did not. I want to buy them all. There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all? Yes. 8,000. And the ones still in training as well. Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor. I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop. Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this. Your ship will buy you 100 Unsullied. Because Master Kraznys is generous. The gold you have left is worth 10. But good Master Kraznys will give you 20. The Dothraki you have with you ... The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them. Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 Unsullied. I have dragons. I'll give you one. You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace. Khaleesi, please. Three dragons. One. Two. One. They want the biggest one. Done. Done. I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck. Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army. Aegon Targaryen proved that. You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood? Do you have a name? This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace. Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice? No, Your Grace. No family living. You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth. Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less. I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? \"Let me die.\" There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace. Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience? All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it. And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed. Valar morghulis. Yes, all men must die. But we are not men. A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers. I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city. Not for bastards. That's all of them, my lord. Thank you, my dear. Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment. Yes, my lord. I hear you owe that boy a significant debt. Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid. You should have him knighted. If only the Master of Coin had such power. If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her. Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding. Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship. We don't. I did f*ck her once. I know. But we don't. I know. But how would the queen get that idea? Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position? Keep a low profile. If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are. Well, you are richer than I am. Good point. They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores. I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie. Come on, I'm here later. Come on. Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading. You think all reading is dull reading. It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know. The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages. Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to. Unless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up. Yes, my lord. Podrick. Yes, my lord? After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman? No, my lord. Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers. She's not bad with second-timers, either. Uh, my lord... A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say? Now, as it happens, Marei... is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me. He's handsome. You didn't tell me he was handsome. Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot. My lord, I don't even... She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as \"my lord.\" Be back in time for my supper. Pace yourself, lad. For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold. Let me guess. He's not a magician. No. He's stealing it? Worse, he's borrowing it. What's wrong with that? We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father. Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt. Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive. I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules. Well... Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest. And what if I don't? Well, you have to. But what if I don't? This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back. Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step? The lad's practically skipping. You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth? Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year. He's a squire. You don't pay him. Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year. They wouldn't take it, my lord. Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin. Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them. What did you tell them? I didn't tell them anything. What did you do to them? Lots of things. And they seemed to like these things? Yes, my lord. Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it. Only they weren't paid. What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free? Is that what you're telling us? Sit down, Podrick. We're going to need details. Copious details. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on. Ha! Ha! You know how we deal with runaways here, do you? Take off his pants. No! No! No, no, no! I'm gonna f*ck you into the dirt. No, please! No, no, no! No, don't! No, please! No! No! You little b*st*rd. Come, my lord. You're a long way from home and winter is coming. I'll take the big bitch first. When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off. My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing. Catelyn Stark's a treasonous c**t. Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said sh1t about you. You're only making it worse. Take her over there where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy. Come on! You know who she is, don't you? A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big. She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth? I'm gonna cut your throat! They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones. I know what they are. Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched. Bring her back here. Yes, my lord. Get up. Come on. Come on, on your feet. Unbesmirched. Not defiled. Fancy word for a fancy man. I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words. I bet you did. Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back? You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles ... you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold. Aye, you have both. Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding. Hard to argue with that. Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once. None of us are. Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree. Come on, men. Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat. I'm famished, actually. I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire. Well, I do like partridge. Bring the bird over here and the carving knife. Will this work as a table, my lord? Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic ... ah! On the stump. You think you're the smartest man there is. That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots. My father ... And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say \"my father\" and that's it, all your troubles are gone. Don't. Have you got something to say? Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that. Here, this should help you remember. ?

Thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here. They came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked. Your sword. The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night. How?

There is only hope of escaping the North with his head. Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes. With the exception of Theon Greyjoy. I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer. Mance is gonna march on the wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth 1,000 fighting against him.

Tell them I am very much alive. Yes, My Lord. Would you like something for the pain? What happened? The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father. Where am I? These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King. Oh. For your trouble. I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather Tywin Lannister the savior of the city and the Hand of the King. Thank you, Your Grace. Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward. For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal... With all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time. You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons. Ser Loras Tyrell. Your House has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it and it shall be yours. Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before... She remains innocent. I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our Houses. Is this what you want, Lady Margaery? With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me. Well, I too have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, My Lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A King must keep his word. Your Grace, in the judgment of your small council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you... to set Sansa Stark aside. Margaery! We want Margaery! I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow. Your Grace, the Gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness. I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the Gods. The Gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. You will be my Queen and I will love you from this day until my last day. My Lady. My sincerest condolences. They're right ... I'm not good enough for him. You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well. But if he's not marrying me ... He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home. King's Landing is my home now. Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you. Come in. Make yourself comfortable. That doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me. No need for that, my dear. You sure? Most men like what they see. I'm not like most men. That's what most men say. If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do. I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be. Have we met? You wouldn't remember me if we had? I meet a lot of men. And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them. You're very kind, My Lord. Allow me to return the favor. You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there. I know who you are. And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other. How do you know about that? I thought you said you knew who I was. What can I do for you, Lord Varys? Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner. I'm afraid of him. Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks. You're a virgin, I take it? Walk. Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside big Brienne. One or two tried. Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough. Not interested. Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman. Ah. \"They lay with lions.\" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks. I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams. What are you doing? Burying them. We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river. I think these women would understand if ... I don't care what you think. I didn't leave it here. Untie me now. I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more. So unless it got stuck in your ass on its way to your c**t, it stands to reason that it's gone ... whoa! What's your business here? Traveling a prisoner. You're a woman. A woman! Well, f*ck me! If you've quite finished up ... All right, we'll be going. Whoa, whoa. Who do you fight for? The Starks. What did he do? Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew? No, stealing is a crime. But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you. Where are you taking him? To Riverrun. Why Riverrun? Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in. Why not kill him? For stealing a pig? I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone. Sending him with you? How important could he be? All right, have it your way, m'lady. Do I know you? Have you been to Ashemark? No. Then you don't know me. Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock? Is it near Ashemark? No. I've never been there. What do you think of these beauties? I hope you gave them quick deaths. Two of them we did, yeah. Wait. I do know you. That's Jaime Lannister. I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig. If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it. How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like? I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the King. He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head. I have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three. Two quick deaths. Those were Stark men. I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told her I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay. Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross. I know that. And you mean to do it anyway? I love her. I know that seems important to you. It is important to me. Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer. And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had? Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting? Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it. And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing ... My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless. You said you saw my victory in the flames. I did. I still see it. The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a Fire God. I fought for your God in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the Seventh Hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me? The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses. You claimed to speak for a God. Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle? You talk about war as if you understand it. I've been fighting far longer than you. Have you? Show me how you fight. Show me. Where's your God now? Will he save you? Where is your God? Inside you. I murdered my brother. We murdered him. Share the weight with me. He wasn't your brother. This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be King. You promise these things, but... you don't know. None of us know. Let me show you. Look into the fire, my King. Look. I see fire. Keep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my King? Yes. I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing c**t before I fall. They want you to know you're surrounded. I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded. They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before ... Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me. No word from my father? No. Send more ravens. You killed all the ravens. The first time I saw Winterfell... The first time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, \"of course Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. We never stood a chance against a man who lives here.\" Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home. Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of sh1t has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father... I will kill that man. I swear it to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every f*cking God in every f*cking heaven, I will kill that man. Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you. And what's your counsel, trusted friend? Run. 500 Northmen wait outside the walls. You have 20 men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run. There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family. Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch. Once a man has taken the Black... he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven. I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates. There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck... the Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there. The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep. The opportunity to make amends for what you've done. I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing. I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet. You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else. You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to f*ck us. Well, I haven't had a good f*ck in weeks. I'm ready for one. They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland. Aye! You think they're right? Aye. We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from 100 wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman, and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr; Wex and Urzen; Stygg and Black Lorren ... Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle. Aye! Mothers will name their sons for us. Aye! Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them. Aye! And whoever kills that f*cking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke! Aye! What is dead may never die! What is dead may never die! Ah! Thought he'd never shut up. It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt. What is this? What are you doing? Let's go home. Come on. Why should I believe you? Why would I lie about it? To create strife between my sister and me. Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your Squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man. Pod. Yes, My Lord? Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week? No, My Lord. You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal Gold Cloaks outside my door at all times. I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The Gold Cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak. Then my hill tribesmen. Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, My Lord. Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends. We are. Podrick, would you mind? There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The King won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget. Come along now, Podrick. My love. It was good of you to come. Good of me? Of course I come. I want to see you. Believe me, you don't. Have you looked? I will be the first. Well? You are a mess. I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double. You think I'm here for money? That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me. Aw, I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. f*ck your money. Let's leave. Leave? Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers ... you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. You don't belong here. What would we do in Pentos? Eat, drink, f*ck, live. I want to go with you. So do it. Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they can't stop you. Forget about them. Come with me. I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Outtalking them, outthinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave? You have a sh1t memory. I am yours and you are mine. In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon one another and say the words. Father, smith, warrior, mother, maiden, crone, stranger... I am hers and she is mine... I am his and he is mine... from this day until the end of my days. Is this a riddle? Khaleesi! Khaleesi! Khaleesi! Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl? How did he find us? What are you doing here? Waiting for you. How did you know we'd come this way? After all the things you have seen, this is your question? How did you kill those guards? Was it hard? No harder than taking a new name if you know the way. Show me how. I want to be able to do it, too. If you would learn, you must come with me. Where? Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos. My dancing master was from Braavos. To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man ... that is something else entirely. A girl has many names on her lips ... Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, Ilyn Payne, the Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all one by one. I want to. But I can't. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her, too. Then we must part. A man has duties as well. Here. What is it? A coin of great value. Could it buy a horse? It is not meant for the buying of horses. Then what good is it? If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, \"Valar Morghulis.\" Valar Morghulis. Please don't go, Jaqen. Jaqen is dead. Say it again. Valar Morghulis. Valar Morghulis. Good. Farewell, Arya Stark. Osha, what are you doing? Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers. We'll make you better. I feel just fine. They burned it down. They burned everything. Not everything. Not you. But they may come back. You have to go. Put on your warmest clothes. Pack as much food as you can carry and go north. North's the wrong way. Their mother and brother are south. We don't know where. There are too many enemies in the South. Go to the Wall to Jon. He'll look after you and let your mother know you're safe. I don't want to leave you. No more than I want to leave you. I pulled you into the world. Both of you. I've seen both your faces almost every day since. And for that, I consider myself very, very lucky. Go now with Hodor. Go on. I'll be right here. Hodor. Osha. You must protect them. You're the only one who can. You may have to protect them against your own kind. I've got no great love for my own kind. I'll get you milk of the poppy. Tell me where to find it. I don't want milk of the poppy. Do it quickly. Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. They miss their mother. They want to be with you. Do you want to be with them? You will be. When your dragons were born, our magic was born again. It is strongest in their presence. And they are strongest in yours. You will be with them, through winter, summer, and winter again. Across a thousand thousand seasons you will be with them. And we will be with you until time comes to an end. Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn. This is not my home. My home is across the sea where my people are waiting for me. They will be waiting a long time. Dracarys. We should be there by sundown. Won't be a fun night for you. Mance knows how to make crows sing. If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night. Not talking's not the way to go. Careful with that. You might cut yourself. Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle. Enough of that! Stop! Why, traitor? So you can give Mance Rayder an invitation to Castle Black? Let 'em fight. That's it? That's what you can do? You little sh1t. Your traitor father teach you that? Or was it your whore mother? We are the Watchers on the Wall. You can tell Mance that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand. Burn the body. Aye. You don't want this one coming back for you. Come along, Jon Snow. Time to meet the King-Beyond-The-Wall. What the ... ? Khaleesi, please. He said you'd never leave Qarth alive. Come. Nothing. Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson. I am King of Qarth. I can help you now, truly help you. We can take the Iron Throne. I'll bring you 1,000 ships. Please, Khaleesi, I beg you. All that you have dreamed is within your reach! I beg you, please! Khaleesi. Please! Please! - Khaleesi! It's all a lie. Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship? Aye, a small ship. I thought we were coming north to fight wildlings. Is this goat? It's moose. People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn sh1t to keep warm. Well, you see a tree, let me know. If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is ... Just bloody kill me. No, truly. The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better. The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you. And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing. It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back. Two blasts is wildlings. You're not fighting them alone. Come on. Three blasts? Run! Wait! Wait for me! Grenn! Edd!", "episode_21": "( wind howling ) ( panting ) ( breathing heavily ) Brother? ( snow crunching ) ( Ghost snarling ) Did you send the ravens? Tarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens? That was your job. Your only job. We need to get back to the Wall. It's a long march. We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead. ( wind blowing ) ( people talking indistinctly ) First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow? Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail. ( growling ) Man: Crow! Boy: Crow! Girl: Look over there! Man #2: Crow! Girl: Crow! Look over here! Look! Woman: Ah, look, crow coming! Boy: Crow! Ygritte: You're wearing the wrong color. Mance was a ranger. In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free. When I'm free, will I be free to go? Crow! Crow! Sure, you will. Oh! ( laughter ) And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul. What happened to their fathers? Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't... I smell a crow. We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one. What do we want with a baby crow? This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us. That half-handed c**t killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size. My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts. Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy? Jon Snow. Your Grace. ( laughter ) Your Grace? ( laughter ) Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart. ( laughs ) Stand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall. So, you're Ned Stark's b*st*rd. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us. The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us? Bearded warrior: Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls. This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane. Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand. He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead. He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him? The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning. Why? He wants me to lead one day. But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall. If I'm a traitor, then you are, too. Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow? I want to be free. No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us? We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw... You saw what? I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it. You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers? Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place? We'll need to find you a new cloak. ( children chattering ) What if you took off that bit there? Don't you want to leave something to the imagination? Trouble is, I've never had much imagination. I want you to take it off. ( tsks ) Mouth. ( door opens, closes ) Podrick: Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn. I didn't hear that. Apologies, ser. Bronn: Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more. Lord Tyrion sent me. I will murder you, boy. He said it was a matter of life and death. ( knocking ) Pod? Cersei: It's your sister. The queen. What are they doing here? Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in? No, I don't think so. If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me? They stay outside. I'm not afraid of you, little brother. Why are you here? I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that. The man who cut me lost more than his nose. I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father. Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me. No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room. Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees. You're meeting Father today? How do you know that? Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him? What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came. You're going to make me cry. Why do you care what I want from him? Because you've slandered me to Father before. Slandered? When? You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock. You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe. I was nine, too. She lost an eye, if I remember correctly. If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again. It's not slander if it's true. And what's this truth you plan on telling him today? Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father? Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey. Any lies in particular? You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are. Still makes me more clever than you. ( door opens ) Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares. Ser Meryn Trant. Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. You're no knight. Pod. Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself. You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more. That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion. You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand. As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me. A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me. I've been doing that for a while now. Do you grow bored protecting me? I grow poor protecting you. Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch. Briefly. I'm sure you filled your pockets. And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more. I thought we were friends. We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor. How much? Double. Double? I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double. I don't even know how much I'm paying you now. Which means you can afford it. ( breathing heavily ) ( waves lapping ) ( seabirds calling ) Here. Here! Help me! ( horn blowing ) Who are you? I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight. Aye, ser, and serving which king? The one true king of Westeros ... Stannis Baratheon. I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son? He may have swam ashore as you did. No, the wildfire took him. I saw it. I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father. If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives? He licks his wounds at Dragonstone. Will you take me there? There is nothing for me at Dragonstone. This war is not over. Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over. We're both sworn to King Stannis. I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships. Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ... He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive. What? They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned. I'm a pirate. You're a smuggler. Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid. Take me back there, please. You cannot turn Stannis against her. Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out. You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend. You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day. And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors. I have to stop her. Please, do this for me. When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck. We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal. There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin. I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend. The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one. ( flies buzzing ) 200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep. The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons. Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free. The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him. Robb: A Mallister? Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman. Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell. Talisa: She's your mother. She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice. ( coughing ) Water. Water. This needs to be cleaned and closed. What's your name, friend? Qyburn. You're lucky to be alive. Lucky? ( birds cawing ) ( sighs ) The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position? Am I enjoying it? I was very happy as Hand of the King. ( chuckles ) Yes. I heard how happy you were. ( blows ) You brought a whore into my bed. It wasn't your bed at the time. I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves. Occasionally I drank with the harlots. What do you want, Tyrion? Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield. Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal. I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start. Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want. I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir. You want Casterly Rock? It is mine by right. ( sighs ) We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock. Why? Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go. Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang. Sansa: Dorne. It's going to Dorne. Shae: Why Dorne? It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm. I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm. Don't ruin the game. I told you, I don't want to play. What about that one there? That one? It's going to Volantis. Why? Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one. That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why. Why should I make up a story when I know the truth? Because the truth is always either terrible or boring. Lovely day for it. Watching the ships. Lord Baelish. Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment? I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister. Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home. You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ... I won't tell anyone. How do I know? Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when. I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice. You're her handmaiden? Yes. And you're his...? I help manage his affairs. He's an important person. So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I. Yes. Given where we started. And where is that? It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Ros: Watch out for her. I always do. Watch out for her with him. ( dragon screeching ) ( screeches ) ( screeches ) ( screeching ) They're growing fast. Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army. ( dragon screeching ) We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world. The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people. Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne? It's too beautiful a day to argue. ( man vomiting ) You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas. Daenerys: Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ... The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before. ( seabirds calling ) Your Grace. I heard you were dead. Not yet. I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace. We are alone. Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight. I am fighting. By burning prisoners alive? How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos? I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone. I'm not your enemy. You are my enemy. Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them. ( gasps ) Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true. Death by fire is the purest death. ( growls ) This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons. Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell. Your Grace! Come on. You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos. She will destroy us all! I will pray for you. Davos: Your Grace! ( door closes ) ( guards shouting ) Guard: Halt. Down. Guard #2: Halt. Down. Why have we stopped? It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace. Joffrey: What is she doing? Who gave her permission? Maid: My lady. We should have guards, my lady. Why? Pardon me. Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress. I have others. Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace? No. He was a soldier. He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay. He never came back. And your mother? She died when she had me. Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them. Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father. He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier. And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him. Was your father a soldier, too? You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you. ( children laughing ) Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me. ( doors open ) Your Grace. Your Grace. Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time? ( laughs ) That's a lovely gown, my lady. Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold. The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace. Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady? I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras? Yes. Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it. You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning. Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about. Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden. The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart. Cersei: An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life. My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger. You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery. Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need. Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing. I'm sure she does. ( speaking Valyrian ) The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water. ( speaking Valyrian ) They will stand until they drop. ( speaking Valyrian ) Such is their obedience. They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training. They begin their training at five. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training. ( speaking Valyrian ) Missandei: Their discipline and loyalty are absolute. They fear nothing. Even the bravest men fear death. ( continues in Valyrian ) Missandei: My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them. He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace. ( speaking Valyrian ) Tell the good master there is no need. Missandei: My master points out that men don't need nipples. ( speaking Valyrian ) To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them. You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin? ( speaking Valyrian ) ( continues in Valyrian ) My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother. How many do you have to sell? ( Missandei speaking Valyrian ) 8,000. Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested. 8,000 dead babies. The Unsullied are a means to an end. Once I own them, these men ... They're not men. Not anymore. Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be? Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you? You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point. You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it. ( grunts ) ( chittering ) ( hisses ) The warlocks. I owe you my life, ser. The honor is mine, my queen. You know this man? I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard. King Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them. I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father. Allow me to join your Queensguard and I will not fail you again.", "episode_26": "The raven brings the sight. Seeing things that haven't happened yet? Things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away. You have the sight, too? Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you. You'd like to know that. He's no crow. We'll find out soon enough. Stannis: How long will you be gone? I don't know. You told me your magic requires a king's blood. Yes. I'm the one true king. But there are others with your blood in their veins. The Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras. We need to find Sansa Stark a different husband. You can't mean it. Tyrion will do as he's bid, as will you. What do you mean? You'll marry Ser Loras. I will not. Yes, you will. Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer. Pick him up, Locke. Cut her free. Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later. Theon: How far is it to Deepwood Motte? Boy: Not far, my lord. Your sister's waiting for you there. ( yells ) Put him back where he belongs. ( yelling ) Rickard Karstark, I sentence you to die. I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry-- Walder Frey. ( shouting ) ( women screaming ) I shall have your head for this! We have to go. Now! ( baby crying ) ( men chanting ) Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Lord, cast your light... Arya: I thought he killed you. He did. But how...? How many times have you brought me back? It's the Lord of Light brings you back. How many times? This makes six. ( theme music playing ) You've got too much wood in there. But the more wood, the bigger the fire. It needs to breathe. Take off that big log. Huh. You know your fires. Someone built your fires for you growing up? It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course. I knew you were highborn. Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think. What does it do? I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it? ( baby coos ) How much longer? Not so far. A few more days. Is the Wall as big as they say? Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds. You're playing with me. I'm not. It's 700 feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best. Do you sing? No. No, no, no. Not very well. Sing me a song. Oh, all right. Let's see. ( baby coos ) Oh... ahem. ? The father's face is stern and strong ? ? He sits and judges right from wrong ? ? He weighs our lives, the short and long ? ? And loves the little children ? ? The mother gives the gift of life ? ? And watches over every wife ? ? Her gentle smile ends all strife ? ? And she loves her little children. ? That's not how you skin a rabbit. I know how to skin a rabbit. Not by the looks of it. You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game. I didn't see any game before I got here. If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits. Well, I made this bow myself. Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall. You learn how to use your fists, though. Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death? I had someone else in mind. Well, someone else is sitting right here. You're both very good at skinning rabbits. Some of us are just a little better. Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall? You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth. Bran: Stop it! Hodor. You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it. Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground. You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back. Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat. First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace. Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine. I said so, didn't I? Osha! You're a good little hunter. Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you. Don't push me. ( Jojen gasping ) Shh. I'm right here with you. What's happening? I'm right here with you. What's wrong with him? The visions take their toll. He's having one now? I saw Jon Snow. You saw him? At Castle Black? He was on the wrong side of the Wall... surrounded by enemies. Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes. Your flock gets smaller every year. You ever climbed it before? No. But Tormund's done it half a hundred times. You're afraid. Aren't you? Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down. I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good. You kill someone for them? Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised. He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue. Can we not talk about that here? ( mocking ) \"Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.\" Did I seem scared the other day? You were trembling like a leaf. Only in the beginning. ( chuckles ) Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. What secret? Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent. But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down. It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me. I won't. 'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck. Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers. ( laughs ) Arya: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. You're good. You're not as good as you think you are. Face, tits, balls-- I hit 'em right where I wanted to. Aye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position. Keep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold. What? Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold. But I have to aim. Never aim. Never aim? Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye. There's someone out there. That's about far enough. We come as friends. Anguy: Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that. Valar morghulis. Thoros: Valar dohaeris. My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady? Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the ladies. How many times has the Lord brought him back? Six. I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. f*cked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but... he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him. You've been to the other side. The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason. You have someone He needs. Anguy: Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at 200 yards. Can you make 'em? Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel. I'll get you the steel. Man: Come on. Arya: I don't like that woman. That's 'cause you're a girl. What does that have to do with anything? Forgive me, lad. What are you doing? Let go of him. Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them! We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy. Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she? You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold. We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold. Gendry: You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you. You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall. You're a witch. You're going to hurt him. I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me-- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again. ( horse neighs ) ( wheels squeaking ) ( pickaxes clanging ) You staring at my ass, Jon Snow? You all right? Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad. ( laughing ) ( horn blowing ) ( gasps ) Sorry. Were you sleeping? Wa-- Wa--? Wa--? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you. ( whimpering ) So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least? Please. Please is not a body part. I'll tell you everything, please. But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you. Now... how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that. ( groans ) You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger. If I win, you'll let me go? If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention. Please. You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we? The North. Too vague. Deepwood Motte. ( laughing ) Terrible guess. ( crying out ) Now, where? Last Hearth. Do I look like a f*cking Umber to you? ( screams ) Karhold! Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in? No. It was just a guess. Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I? Torrhen Karstark. He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer. He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark. You swore to tell me if I-- You're right. Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me. Yes. You win. Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar. ( screams ) I'm afraid I am. ( screaming ) Everything I told you is a lie. ( screaming ) This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason-- I enjoy it. Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off! ( screaming ) I win. Robb: Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times. The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come. Lothar: Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters. Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong. As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands. I don't think that's-- We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it. And there's something else. We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs. Not what, whom. What? ( chuckles ) No. Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters-- Roslin. How old is she? 19. Could I see her first? You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end. Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war? Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband. And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements. He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it. Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord. Robb: He's a proud man and we've wounded him. I didn't wound him. My answer is no. Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-- The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry. The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth. It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead. He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing. You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife? I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill. You recall that heroic engagement? I had something less permanent in mind. I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost. I'll marry her. You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it. Roose: I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear. Brienne: Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing. When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason. I should send you back to Robb Stark. You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be? Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you. We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution. You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies. It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it. King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else. He'll make time for you. As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming. Shall we drink on it? I don't partake. You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people? Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident. Oh, she won't be going with you. I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-- You are charged with abetting treason. I'm afraid I must insist. You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position. Olenna: Impossible. Why? My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-- Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms... and the mother of the king. Old. Old? Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely. The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them? Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through. And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name. Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys? Of course. And you never... No. Not once? Not in any way? Never. I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets. Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior. I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but... brothers and sisters-- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out. I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it. Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation. I don't care what people believe. And neither do you. ( chuckles ) As an authority on myself, I must disagree. Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt. And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take. The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you. If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children. Oh... The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery. You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you? I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage? It's a rare enough thing-- a man who lives up to his reputation. ( men shouting ) ( wind howling ) ( cracking ) ( screaming ) No! ( screams ) ( screaming ) ( grunts ) ( screaming ) ( grunting, shouting ) We've gotta cut them loose! No! ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( screams ) ( grunts ) ( yelling ) ( grunting ) Take my hand! ( panting ) Sansa: That's a wonderful pin. Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so... I'm very happy about... Uh, yes. I-I am as well. I feel like I'm in a dream. Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady? No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place. It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is. Tyrion: I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this. We can have them both killed. It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery. Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together. On a boat you built. The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family. I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it. I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate. Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater? The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot. What do you want me to say? I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger. Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here. Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister. Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands. You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels. When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere. Jaime or not, I'm truly f*cked. Who's going to tell her? Do you think people will like it? I don't think they will even notice it. You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade. I'm sure he does. Will they let me invite my family? They haven't asked my opinion. But do you think they will? No. Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I-- I beg your pardon, my lady. Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding. Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa. Of course. Alone, if I may. Why do you need to speak to her alone? Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to. Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances. It's all right, really. How to begin? It's-- this-- this-- this is awkward. 1,000 blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread. There aren't 1,000 blades. There aren't even 200. I've counted. Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice. Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really... you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want. Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then? You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect... you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience. I did what I did for the good of the realm. The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie. But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all. Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is. ( wind howling ) ( panting ) ( grunts ) ( screeching )", "episode_27": "Lothar: Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters. It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery. Cersei: Who's going to tell her? Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding. Yes, it should be quite a wedding. Roose: I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father that I had nothing to do with your maiming. My lady. She won't be going with you. Let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least? ( screaming ) How many times has the Lord brought him back? - Six. He sent you to us for a reason. You have someone He needs. You told me I could be one of you. You told me this was a brotherhood. You will make kings rise and fall. The visions take their toll. He's having one now? I saw Jon Snow. At Castle Black? He was on the wrong side of the Wall, surrounded by enemies. ( wind howling ) ( both grunting ) ( theme music playing ) 3x07 The Bear and the Maiden Fair ( screeches ) Ygritte: How far are we? About a week, I think. You think? You don't know? Jon: When we went to Castle Black, we took the kingsroad. ( scoffs ) You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners? Most of the time, yes. How do the men holding the banners fight? They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil. And the drummers-- is that a great honor, too? Usually it's the young boys banging the drums. So what good are they? They help the men march. How? Well, it's-- it's the rhythm. Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming. No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming. You know nothing, Jon Snow. Orell: She's right, you don't. I know you cut me loose on the Wall. Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are. And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird? People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her. ( thunder rumbling ) That rain will cost us another day. Frey will wait. He knows we're coming. Lord Walder is prickly by nature. Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met. Yes, and that is why-- I've seen wet sh1ts I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen. I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet sh1ts. ( laughs ) Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight. He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted. He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted. Robb: Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep. ( heavy breathing ) If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again. Attack. Attack. Who are you writing? My mother. Is that Valyrian? Gaaa. Gaaa? ( sighs ) Say hello for me. Rytsas. \"Ritsas.\" ( laughs ) That was close enough. Does she know her daughter's a queen? Not yet. That will be a surprise, I expect. Many surprises for her. How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that? Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over? I will. I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild. What, now? Are you certain? Are you angry with me? Angry? You're my queen. And I have your little prince or princess inside me. Maybe one of each. Don't get greedy. ( laughing ) Can you leave the war for one night? I love you. Do you hear me? I love you. ( thunder rumbles ) Tormund: Most men f*ck like dogs. ( grunting ) No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. ( laughs ) Come on! ( laughs ) Hey, come on. Orell: You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle? No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks. I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls. What, you're jealous? Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own. And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth. You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him? 'Cause he's pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy? Don't touch me. You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is. Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark-- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns. Come on. Come walk with me. I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother. You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances. How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him. Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you? No. Has he been kind to you? He's tried. You don't want him, though. He's a Lannister. Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say? I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you... My son will be king. Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What? My son... with him. I'll have to-- we'll have to-- If it's the pain you're worried about-- I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me. What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar. He's a dwarf. And Loras-- Loras. Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced. And that's a good thing? It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice. How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you? Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me. Tyrion: She's a child. Bronn: She's a foot taller than you. A tall child. What's the youngest you've ever had? Not that young. How much older? Older. You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem. Shae isn't going to like it. Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time? I should never have told you about that. You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own. Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them. You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. ( chuckling ) You want to f*ck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it. I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company. You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free. ( doors close ) Your Grace. Grandfather. You wanted to speak to me? Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council. You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them. I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention. Of course. You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber. I have, yes. May I ask why? The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively. So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand? We could arrange to have you carried. Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons. Where did you hear about this? Is it true? Apparently so. Don't you think we ought to do something about it? When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple. And the biggest was the size of a carriage. Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us. But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel? Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing. But I haven't been counseled. You are being counseled at this very moment. I should be consulted about such things. From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace. Yunkai. The Yellow City. Barristan: The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them. On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man. I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea. We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne. How many slaves are there in Yunkai? 200,000, if not more. Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city. ( drum beating ) ( drumming stops ) Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace. ( dragons screech ) Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons. You may approach. Sit. Will the noble lord take refreshment? Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi. ( screeching ) Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early. If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people. The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen. There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship. My ship? Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require. And what do you ask in return? All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace. I have a gift for you as well. Your life. My life? And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy. You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well. ( screeching ) You swore me safe conduct. I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother. Take the gold. ( screeching ) My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out. ( speaking Valyrian ) The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend. And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about? I don't know. Find out. ( screeches ) ( purring ) Chains? Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock. Golden chains. You could buy a ship with these. Do I need a ship? What? Am I going somewhere? Of course you're not going anywhere. So, am I invited to your wedding? I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it. No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself. That doesn't mean that-- this is duty, not desire. Is that what you will tell yourself when you f*ck her? I don't have a choice. My father-- Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea. What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock. And I'm Shae the funny whore. My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her. While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored? I swear to you it will not be like that. No? What will it be like? I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for. Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them? Listen. Listen to me, my lady. I'm not your lady. You are. You'll always be my lady. I'm your whore. And when you are tired of f*cking me, I will be nothing. ( seabirds calling ) What happened? Wildfire. I should have been here. After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started. Do you miss it? King's Landing? Your father's house. Never had a father. Never wanted one. Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting? I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench. Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up. I was born in Flea Bottom. Your blood is noble. Are you saying my father, he was some lord or... There. Your father's house. I'm just a b*st*rd. The b*st*rd of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood. Come sit by the fire, child. Not talking, eh? That's a first. I don't talk to traitors. I didn't like giving up the boy. But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up. The Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power. When he commands, we obey. He's not my one true god. No? Who's yours? Death. ( men chattering ) ( man coughing ) Spotted a Lannister raiding party. How many? No more than 20. How far? Less than a day's ride south. What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt? Men: Yeah! But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here. It will still be west of here two days from now. You swore. To take you home, and I will. But we need to do this first. Why? So you can steal their gold? I swear to you, this isn't-- I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all. One day you'll understand, but now-- Anguy, bring her back. Man: Come back, girl! ( gasps ) Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good. ( door opens ) I thought you were gone. Tomorrow. Have they told you what they plan to do with me? Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here. With Locke? I owe you a debt. When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid. I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it. Good-bye, Ser Jaime. ( grunting ) Here. Let me. It will take time. Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain. My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand. You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust? Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards. Safe journey, Kingslayer. Nothing to say? I liked you better before. I don't remember chopping your balls off, too. And don't you worry about your friend. We'll take good care of her. Shh. ( Theon groaning ) Gentle, my lord. ( gasping ) Gentle. ( Theon coughs ) Shh shh shh. Myranda knows what she's doing. Let her. She trained as a septa, only... ( giggles ) she had other urges. So did the Septons, only they lied about it. Where is he? Who, my lord? There's no one here but you, me, and Violet. Please. Don't you want us to see it? Oh, come on. Let us see it. Everybody talks about it. He sent you. Who sent us? We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy. We heard so much about it. ( giggles ) Please. Oh! There it is. Oh. Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly. Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face. Help me. If he comes back... We need to make him feel better. And how can we make him feel better? I have an idea. Oh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls. Maybe he doesn't know how we are. Oh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy. As good as they say? Mmm. ( breathing heavily ) And why should you get all the fun? What? You like her better? Plenty there for both of us. I was here first. ( moaning ) ( horn blows ) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing. ( crying ) But I was getting jealous. Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about? ( groans ) Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back. Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part? ( whistles ) Please. ( sobbing ) No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy! This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations. No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please! You're gonna scare it off. I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it. It's too far away. Is that a palace? It's a windmill. Windmill. Who built it? Some king? Just the men who used to live here. Ygritte: They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high. Winterfell has towers three times that size. ( mocking ) \"I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.\" If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell. What's swooning? Fainting. What's fainting? When a girl sees blood and collapses. Why would a girl see blood and collapse? Well... not all girls are like you. Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? ( gasps ) Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow. My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday. I'd like to see you in a silk dress. Would you? So I could tear it off you. Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye. Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell. Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back. Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that. You know nothing-- Six times in the last thousand years, a King-beyond-the-Wall has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed. And how do you know that? Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same. Mance is different. You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together. You don't know that. I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you. All of us. You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live. Yes, first we'll live. ( Jojen speaking quietly ) What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work? Hodor. 00:46:15,058 --] 00:46:18,628 That's where we are. What are you telling him? It's all right, Osha. It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse. Leave him alone. He can speak for himself. I don't fill his head with anything. Osha: So what do you talk about? What's happening to him and what that means. Go on, then. Tell us what it means. It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier. I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black. We're not going to Castle Black. What did you say? I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall. Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me. The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now. You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong. What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason? Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold sh1t for you or me or anyone. You don't understand. You don't know. You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long. I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further. Qyburn: How is the pain, my lord? What's the purpose of an arm with no hand? Well, we've stymied the corruption. Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man. All the good it's done me. You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle. Faint praise, my lord. So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many? No, my lord. That's not my weakness. What is? Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted. You performed experiments on living men. On dying men. With their permission? My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives. Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside. How many men have you killed, my lord? I don't know. 50? 100? Countless. Countless has a nice ring to it. And how many lives have you saved? Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you-- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth? A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered 300 gold dragons for his daughter's safe return. A fair offer. A fair offer. Locke won't take it. Why not? He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros. ( sighs ) He feels he's being cheated. They'd be fools to kill her. These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much. We have to return to Harrenhal. Why? I've left something behind. Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton. And what are those orders? To deliver you to your father at King's Landing. You think you'll get a reward. I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-- You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off. I had nothing-- Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now. ( birds cawing ) Whoa. Eyes open, lads. Be quiet. ( distant men singing ) Men: ? The bear, the bear and the maiden fair ? ? From there to here, from here to there ? ? All black and brown and covered in hair ? ? He smelled that girl in the summer air ? ? The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair! ? ( cheering ) Man: Don't spare her. Don't spare her! ( roaring ) Well, this is one shameful f*cking performance. Stop running and fight. ( bear growling ) A wooden sword? I thought you'd gone. You gave her a wooden sword. We've only got one bear. I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there. All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold. This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and f*ck yourself with it. ( roaring ) Ah! Get behind me. I will not. ( groans ) ( growls ) What the f*ck are you doing to my bear? Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do. Pull her up. Hold my legs. ( roaring ) Pull him up! ( men booing ) The bitch stays. We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me. She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders. What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive? ( bear roaring ) Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires. ( bear roaring )", "episode_24": "Why you help us? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend? You're not our prisoner, little lady. You're lucky we found you. These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. Ride east. Your sister's waiting for you. Come on. Come on. I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. I might be able to take you with me. Watch out for her. Watch out for her with him. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn. My lord. - You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible. I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera. We've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go. What have we here? Frozen crows? Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us. That pig's got value to me. What is it? Yah! Come, my lord. You're a long way from home and winter is coming. I want to buy them all. 8,000. Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this. I have dragons. They want the biggest one. Done. I'll take you as well, now. You think you're the smartest man there is. And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say \"my father.\" You're nothing without your daddy. Never forget that. Here, this should help you remember. How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass? Depends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us? He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him. Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please. If I die, you won't be getting ... Oh, enough. Here. Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast. Stop! Far enough. Do that again and I'll take your other hand. Come on, you. Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in. I hope we might speak. In confidence. Oh, always in confidence. About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time? Oh, no. It's a wonderful time. I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to ... End your life? I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof. Proof? Will there be a trial? I need to know. I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still? I don't know. Do I? As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts. Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which ... You do not possess at the moment. But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special. The sorcerer. Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time... if you have the stomach for it. When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling. Or the sh1t. They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it. And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that. But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling. Oh, look. More sh1t. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day. We need to get out of here. When the Lord Commander says we go, we go. The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us? He had no way of knowing. We do now. We know what's out there. Craster's been out here surviving. So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster? We're like the sons he never had. Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live... we'll have to look out for ourselves. Shh, shh, shh. You woke him. I'm sorry. He's beautiful. Shh! He's beautiful. Does he have a name? No. Are you going to give him one? Why? Here. Gilly. You said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back. I wanted you to have it. I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you? I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time. You have to go after him. How? You know how. Brandon. Mother. How many times have I told you? No climbing. Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me. I want you to promise me. No more climbing. Promise me. Promise me! Promise me! Mother! Mother! Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me! Is he very large? No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was ... Extraordinary. The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men. We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple? What did he do to them? I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive. So what did they say? They said it was hard to describe. Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income? He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey. Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark? He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest. What makes you say so? His shipboard inventory. Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession. Former profession. Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out? Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin. Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls? He's not interested in them, my lord. How do you know? Because I'm one of his girls. Prodigies in odd places indeed. Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there. The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably. There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else. There aren't more than 700 people of any importance. No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats. Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon. He was wrong. And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle. Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried? Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre? Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace. I'd love to see their tombs, really. It's like taking a walk through history. The tomb's just up here. This is so exciting. You were married here, Your Grace? Yes. Must seem like only yesterday. Seems like a lifetime ago. Your husband, was he buried here as well? No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End. Such a tragedy. A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don't mix. I should say not. My son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle. I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year. All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent. I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion. He had no business fighting an actual warrior. We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave. But they do seem to yearn for it. We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing. And yet the world belongs to them. A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind. The gods have seen fit to make it so. My father didn't want them here. He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise. I'm glad he did. I'm sorry, Your Grace. I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this. Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness. I couldn't agree more. Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold. I've spoken with them. I know how they feel about you. You led the defense of King's Landing. They adore you. Open the doors. Joffrey. Wait. Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery! Bless you, Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery! Margaery! Long live Lady Margaery! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! Gods bless King Joffrey! How far is it to Deepwood Motte? Not far, my lord. Your sister is waiting for you there. She sent you to save me? Yes. I served them, the men who were torturing you. I did what they told me and waited for the right moment. Why would you risk your life for me? I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord. I was only a boy when they took you away. My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off. I remember the look on my father's face when he told us, \"That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son.\" And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you. Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me. Did he? I ... I don't know, my lord. They ... they never told me much. My sister's men are loyal to her. We don't need to hide from them. Not all those are your sister's men. Some of them are loyal to your father. What is it? I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place. What did he tell you to do? Raid fishing villages. He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark. Ha. I could never be a Stark. Robb Stark always reminded me of that. He lorded it over you? Didn't have to. All he had to do was be. Be who he was born to be. His life fit him better than his clothes. How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He's the King in the North. And me... my father gave me a choice and I made it. I could never be a Stark. But ironborn, that's what I was born to be. I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys. The Stark boys? Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies... so I could keep Winterfell... and make my father proud. Maybe it's not too late. It is. My real father lost his head at King's Landing. I made a choice... and I chose wrong. And now I've burned everything down. Not everything, my lord. She's up here. Yara. Shh. Wait. I brought him back. He killed the others. What? No, I didn't. You can't! No, please stop! No! Put him back where he belongs. Eat. What are you doing? I'm dying. You can't die. You need to live to take revenge. I don't care about revenge. You coward. A little misfortune and you're giving up. Misfor ... misfortune? You lost your hand. My sword hand. I was that hand. You have a taste ... one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit. You sound like a bloody woman. I know what you did for me. You told them Tarth was full of sapphires. It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water. You knew that. Why did you help me? You wanted to speak to me? Yes, about Jaime. What about him? I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back. When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner... what did I do in response? You started a war. And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir? Whatever you can. Whatever I can. You're still here. Yes. Why? Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me. Years and years of lectures on family and legacy ... the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations ... did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children? All right. Contribute. The Tyrells are a problem. The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives. Margaery has her claws in Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him. Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are. You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city. Perhaps... you should try stopping him from doing what he likes. I will. Do you like it, Nana? Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. \"Growing strong.\" Ha! The dullest words of any house. \"Winter is coming!\" Now that's memorable. \"We do not sow.\" Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong ... ha, that strikes fear in the heart. Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong. My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence. The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me? A little obvious, perhaps. Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It's been so long. Though I rather think it's all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you've come mincing all this way for something. So? Might I sit? No. Come, I've heard you're such a clever man. I'm curious why you've sought me out. You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark. Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? She's an interesting girl. Is she? No, not particularly. But she's had an interesting childhood. She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then. I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being. Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too. I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still. Which is Sansa Stark? Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father. Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head? I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter. How? You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her. That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name. Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor. It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point. Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him. And why have you come to me with this matter? Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army? Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North. And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket. Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride? You must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him. Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes. You are a clever man, Lord Varys. You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution. One doesn't need to be clever for that. It's all rather obvious, isn't it? Ahem. I didn't mean to disturb you. You haven't. We'd like some privacy, please. If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names, I'll ask the king to speak with you himself. What did you pray for? I can't tell you. Why not? I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning. Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you? I'm sorry, I just can't. My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. Pig-face, she called me. Pig-face? That's ridiculous. I think it had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink. So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague. Porridge plague? You don't have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony. But that's awful. You're ... I believed you! Porridge plague. I'm an idiot. Don't say that. No, you're not. So what happened to Alanna? Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It's all terribly frustrating. I'm sure she's jealous of you now. You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen. I want us to be friends, good friends. That would make me very happy. You must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months. I ... I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing. The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras... Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that? His name was Bannen. He was a good man, a good ranger. He came to us from ... where did he come from? Down White Harbor way. He came to us from White Harbor. Never failed in his duty. He kept his vows the best he could. He rode far, fought fiercely. We shall never see his like again. And now his watch has ended. And now his watch has ended. Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man. It wasn't his foot that killed him. That b*st*rd Craster starved him to death. Craster's got his daughters to feed. You on his side? We can't just show up and steal all his food. We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves. The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow. He's a bloody wildling is all he is. Never knew Bannen could smell so good. You have one son, don't you, Mormont? I had my 99th. You ever meet a man with 99 sons? And more daughters than I can count. I'm glad for you. Are you now? Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone. As soon as our wounded are strong enough. Ah. They're as strong as they're gonna get. Them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it? Hmm? Or leave them if you've not the stomach and I'll sort them myself. Whose throat you gonna cut, old man? Wait outside. It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat. My wives gave you bread. There's sawdust in the bread. You don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow. I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away. I told you to wait outside. He's sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die. I gave you crows enough. I've got to feed my women! So you admit you've got a hidden larder, then? How else'd you make it through winter? Enough! Out! I am a godly man. You're a stingy b*st*rd! b*st*rd? Out with you, you little thief. And you! And you! Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies. I'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me b*st*rd. You are a b*st*rd. A daughter-fucking, wildling b*st*rd. The gods will curse us for this. By all the laws ... There are no laws beyond the Wall. Now show us where he hides the food or you'll get the same as he did. Unhand her. I shall have your head for this. Quickly. Quickly. What's happening? I'm not going out there. No, we have to go. Now! Follow me. I know the best way. Come on. Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well! I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights. Can I take this hood off yet? I do apologize, little lady, but it's better for you if you don't see where we're going. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Halt! What is it? Blackstrap rum. Ugh! Not easy finding molasses in wartime. I'd have some. Let's go home. What is this place? Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling. You look like a bunch of swineherds. Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before. You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier? No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier. Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days. And I won't see them again. Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it. Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are 1,000 miles from home. Which of us is running? Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants? Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name. Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive. You're fighting for ghosts. That's what we are ... ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear ... Lannister, Stark, Baratheon ... you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down. You found god? Is that it? Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen. If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it. You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice. And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched. I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door. House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne. Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime? Murder is a crime. I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not. You murdered Mycah. The butcher's boy. My friend. He was 12 years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer. Aye, he was a bleeder. You don't deny killing this boy? I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince. That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away. Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes. You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat. So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here? Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight. The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price. And who knows? In 10 years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper. Is it done, then? They belong to me? It is done. You hold the whip. Dracarys.", "episode_25": "The Tyrells are a problem. The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon.

Kissed by Fire Original Air Date on April 28, 2013 ? Lord, cast your light upon us. Lord of Light, defend us. Show us the truth. Strike this man down if he is guilty. Give strength to his sword if he is true. Lord of Light, give us wisdom. For the night is dark and full of terrors. For the night is dark and full of terrors. Get back. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Kill him! Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished. Restore it. For the night is dark and full of terrors. Lord, cast... Arya, don't! Bring him back from death and darkness... No! Let go of me! Let me go! Looks like their god likes me more than your butcher's boy. Burn in hell! He will. But not today. Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. Tell me what you know. There are four to a patrol ... two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies. How often do these patrols go out? It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you. You'd like to know that. There are 19 castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned? Three. You sure of that? Which three? Castle Black. Aye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others? Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower. How many men remain in Castle Black? 1,000. Liar. What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground? He's no crow. Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us. I'm not afraid of you. I like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat. 1,000 men. We'll find out soon enough. I don't need you to protect me. Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt. Give it back. Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back. Ygritte! Ygritte! Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte! Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself. Ygritte. You swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me. All of me. We shouldn't. We should. Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno ... That thing you did with your mouth ... is that what lords do to their ladies in the South? I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all. Hmm. You seemed to like it. Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that? There's been no one else. Only you. A maid. You were a maid. I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid? What do you think? Who was he? Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But... he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth. Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund ... I'm not done with you yet. How long's it been since you had a bath? Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever. I want my gold. It says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over. Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves. We're outlaws. Outlaws steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you. Come try it, archer. I'll shove those arrows up your ass. You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty. Not in the eyes of god. You can't! Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make. Go in peace, Sandor Clegane. The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet. Riders coming through! The Kingslayer. Down! On your knees. Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer. Pick him up, Locke. You've lost a hand. No, my lord, he has it here. Take this away. Send it to his father? You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it. Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now. Thank you, my lord. Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later. Lord Bolton. Is there word from the capital? You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister... How can I put this? Your sister... is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed. Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn. Will I die? No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off. Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain? The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow. I don't need my right hand to kill you. I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption with boiling wine. Mmm. With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy. No milk of the poppy. There will be pain. I'll scream. Quite a bit of pain. I'll scream loudly. Lord Baelish. Your Grace. I wonder if I might ask you for a favor. Of course, Your Grace. I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart. I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin? My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts. Myself, I often find them a hindrance. And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital. I shall do my best. Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark? I assure you that it will. Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern. Pardon, my lady. No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons? Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters. I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters? It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it. Naturally. It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used. What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding? I understand that. Good. But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense. And? And we're at war, Lady Olenna. Oh, I'd nearly forgotten. Yes, and maintaining supply lines ... I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, 12,000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? 1,800 mounted lances. 2,000 in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. 20,000 head of cattle. 50,000 sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them. And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm. As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say? I would. And traditionally paid for by the royal family. I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis? My lady ... Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient? Quite sufficient. Thank you. Very good, then. That's settled. Good day. Give me that. What are you doing? Just mending Lord Beric's armor. Why? I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood. Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet. The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood. You don't have to do this. I want to. They need good men. Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you ... What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving. You just said you were serving Lord Beric. He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family. I can be your family. You wouldn't be my family. You'd be \"my lady.\" Willem. Willem! Is this a rescue? Lannister filth! Take him! Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please ... Bring them in. Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires? Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance. Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen ... Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin. They were boys! Look at them. Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I. My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason. It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy? Leave him. Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North? Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest. Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards. This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die. Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me! Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it. Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer? It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done. I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die. The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord. Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you. You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead. And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it. Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage. A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed. The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin ... Stark and Karstark. That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now. I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days. Kneel, my lord. Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word? Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine. Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me? At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home. I'm a hostage and you're selling me. Don't think of it that way. But it is that way. It is. And it isn't. More is than isn't. Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether. So why don't you? We need the gold. Do I frighten you, child? No. You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged. I thought he killed you. He did. But how...? Thoros... how many times have you brought me back? It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words. How many times? Five, I think. No, this makes six. Six. There was the first time ... the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest. Then I was stabbed in the belly. Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side. Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye? Both. Fuckers couldn't decide. And the Hound makes six. Second time I've been killed by a Clegane. You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know. I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away. Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once. I don't think it works that way, child. He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him. I would. You're alive. Lord, cast your light upon me. Protect me in the darkness. Burn away my sins. Help me serve you. Use me as you will. For the night is dark and full of terrors. I have prayed day and night for you to come to me. My lady. I meant to come sooner. The battle ... I know of your troubles, my king. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. Yes, of course. You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious. I believed that once. You are the one god's champion and the finest man I've ever known. Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned. No. I've wronged you. I have shamed you. You're doing god's work. You don't understand. The Red Woman ... the Lady Melisandre ... I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy. Oh, my sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric. I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us. She gave you a son. I gave you... nothing. That's not true. So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions. She's my daughter. I want to see her. You are a king. You don't need my permission. ? Under the sea ? ? I know, I know ? ? Oh, oh, oh ? ? The birds have scales ? ? And the fish take wing ? ? I know, I know ? ? Oh, oh, oh... ? Shireen. Father! You've grown since I last saw you. Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win? No. Did the Onion Knight come back with you? He did. He fought bravely. He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital. He won't be visiting, child. Why not? He's my friend. Look. He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight. Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him. Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off. What are you doing here? I need a bath. Help me out of these rags. Now get out. There's another tub. This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub. Why should I care how you die? You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him. That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most ... Don't you mock me. I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce. You need trust to have a truce. I trust you. There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for 17 years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire? Of course. The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city ... beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken c**t. \"You can trust the Lannisters,\" he said. \"The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.\" So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to... bring him my father's head. Then he... turned to his pyromancer. \"Burn them all,\" he said. \"Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.\" Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then? First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. \"Burn them all,\" he kept saying. \"Burn them all.\" I don't think he expected to die. He ... he meant to... burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me. If this is true... why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark? Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right? Help! Help! The Kingslayer! Jaime. My name is Jaime. Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight. Princess? Gods, what are you doing here? Shh, you'll wake Bert. Bert? He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot. Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew ... He said you were a traitor. Are you? I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price. I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle. Aye. So they did. You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more. Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me. Take it. I have more. My lady, I can't read the words. You can't? I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you. No. No. No. It's easy. It'll be fun. Go. We can't. Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells? I wouldn't know where to start. At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is \"An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.\" It was a bitch of a siege. Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke? The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his. Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle? Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. \"In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.\" All I could think of was how badly I had to piss. In full plate metal for 16 hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots. Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings. You swore an oath. Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her? With all my heart. These are the ones? Yes, khaleesi. The officers. All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut ... Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are ... vermin. King Robert wanted her dead. Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen. I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him. I didn't sit on the small council. No? Doesn't the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally ... Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion. He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics. Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings and betrayals the world over. Mm-hmm. Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms. She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience. Which men do you have in mind? Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years. It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery. I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home. Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man. We both want her to rule. Am I wrong? You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions. If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride. You're not Lord Commander here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen. Come to bed. You were right. The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait. Don't let him. What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day. We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter. Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children. Give them a new purpose. What? Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is. Here. And we're here. King's Landing ... What is it? I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not. And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them. Can you do it? I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry ... Walder Frey. He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might... I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly. Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here. And only one to let you go. Because it will please me. Squire! Well fought, ser. That was no fight. I don't know you. Olyver, if it please you. I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser. How did you know? Know what? That I wanted to. My lord... I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion. They rarely do, in my experience. You have a good deal of experience, do you? With the husbands. That didn't take long. Well, it took long enough. It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed. Is he? And... who's the lucky girl? She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it? What is? It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different. Is it? Lady Margaery wears it that way. Many ladies wear it this way. I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon. You still want me to come with you? It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you? Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare. I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend. I do, Lord Baelish. Petyr. Petyr. If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay. We'll speak again when I return. You're late. What's she doing here? Our business concerns her, too. Sit. You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding. Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss. I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important. Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable. Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras. Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do. Your jokes are not appreciated. It wasn't my best, but ... I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me. Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother. The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells. The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them? There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib. And how do we do that? We find Sansa Stark a different husband. Wonderful. Yes, it is. You can't mean it. I can and I do. Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you. Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours. She's a child! She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length. There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that. And if I refuse? You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed. I was wed. Or don't you remember? Only too well. You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve. Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you. What do you mean? You'll marry Ser Loras. I will not. The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach. No, I won't do it. Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed. I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare. You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all. Father, don't make me do it again, please. Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long. ? It's always summer ? ? Under the sea ? ? I know, I know ? ? Oh, oh, oh ? ? The birds have scales ? ?

He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.\nEddard Stark:  Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.\nVarys:  Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.\nEddard Stark:  You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?\nVarys:  l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.\nEddard Stark:  You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.\nVarys:  Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nTheon shoots a raven coming from The Twins. Robb picks it up and reads the message.\n\nRobb Stark:  lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.\nTheon Greyjoy:  Or so Walder Frey would have you think.\nCatelyn Stark:  Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.\nRobb Stark:  He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?\nGreatjon Umber:  Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.\nRobb Stark:  Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.\nTheon Greyjoy:  Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.\nGreatjon Umber:  Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.\nCatelyn Stark:  The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.\nRobb Stark:  Have my horse saddled and ready.\nGreatjon Umber:  Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.\nTheon Greyjoy:  Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.\nRobb Stark:  My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.\nCatelyn Stark:  l agree. l'll go.\nEveryone:  You can't!\nCatelyn Stark:  l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.\nGreatjon Umber:  Unless there was a profit in it.\n\nCatelyn finds herself inside the Twins, which the Freys gathered to watch her audience with Lord Walder.\n\nWalder Frey:  What do you want?\nCatelyn Stark:  lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord.\nWalder Frey:  Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?\nStevron Frey:  Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is  \nWalder Frey:  Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?\nRyger Rivers:  Father, please  \nWalder Frey:  l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.\n(gestures to Catelyn) All right, you come forward.\n(kisses her hand) There. Now that l've observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.\nCatelyn Stark:  ls there somewhere we can talk?\nWalder Frey:  We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!\n(taps his new wife on the bottom) Oh! You too.\n(To Catelyn) You see that? Fifteen, she is. A little flower. And her honey's all mine.\nCatelyn Stark:  l'm sure she will give you many sons.\nWalder Frey:  Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.\nCatelyn Stark:  He is quite ill, my lord.\nWalder Frey:  Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me.\nCatelyn Stark:  My lord, l  \nWalder Frey:  Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.\nCatelyn Stark:  l'm sure there were reasons  \nWalder Frey:  l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?\nCatelyn Stark:  To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.\nWalder Frey:  Why should l let him?\nCatelyn Stark:  lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.\nWalder Frey:  There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.\nCatelyn Stark:  You swore an oath to my father.\nWalder Frey:  Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.\nCatelyn Stark:  Why don't you?\nWalder Frey:  Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAt Castle Black, Jon Snow and Commander Mormont are having a chat.\n\nVoices outside:  And engage!\nJeor Mormont:  When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?\nJon Snow:  Soon, he says.\nJeor Mormont:  Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.\nJon Snow:  This is Valyrian steel.\nJeor Mormont:  lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.\nJon Snow:  My lord, you honor me, but l can't  \nJeor Mormont:  Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?\nJon Snow:  Yes, my lord.\nJeor Mormont:  Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it.\nJon Snow:  l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.\nJeor Mormont:  No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist   l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.\nJon Snow:  Yes, my lord.\n\nJon Snow leaves the room and emerges outside, heading towards the mess hall.\nUnidentified Night s Watchers:  Well done. Well done.\nNight s Watcher #1:  You earned that, Snow.\nNight s Watcher #2:  Well done.\n\nJon arrives at the mess hall. The other men gather around him to see his new sword, but Sam remains seated at a distance, looking distraught.\n\nPyp:  Go on, let's have a look.\nJon Snow:  At what?\nGrenn:  The sword! Show us the sword.\nAll:  Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!\nPyp:  Let's have a look.\nGrenn:  Piss off.\nPyp:  Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!\nGrenn:  Look at its eyes.\nWhile the others are playing with the sword, Jon gets seated beside Sam.\nJon Snow:  What is it?\nSamwell Tarly:  l - l can't.\nJon Snow:  You can't what?\nSamwell Tarly:  l'm really not supposed to say.\nJon Snow:  And yet you really want to say. You want to say that \nSamwell Tarly:  There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.\nJon Snow:  What? What about him?\nSamwell Tarly:  He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe.\nJon Snow:  l should be there. l should be with him.\n\n--------------------------\nBack at the Crossing, Catelyn returns from her conversation with Walder Frey at the Twins, and finds Robb and the others having a meeting in his tent.\n\nGreatjon Umber:  lf we do that, they'll never get back across.\nRobb Stark:  Well? What did he say?\nCatelyn Stark:  Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well.\nRobb Stark:  Huh.\nCatelyn Stark:  Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.\nRobb Stark:  What does he want in return?\nCatelyn Stark:  You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.\nRobb Stark:   Fine, fine. And?\nCatelyn Stark:  And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.\nRobb Stark:  She won't be happy about that. And?\nCatelyn Stark:  And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.\nRobb Stark:  l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?\nCatelyn Stark:  l did.\nRobb Stark:  And?\nCatelyn Stark:  One was   Do you consent?\nRobb Stark:  Can l refuse?\nCatelyn Stark:  Not if you want to cross.\nRobb Stark:  Then l consent.\nRobb leaves the meeting right away. Theon laughs while Catelyn watches.\nWe cut to a shot of Robb s men on the other side of the river, having already crossed the Green Fork of the Trident and heading south.\n\n--------------\nBack at Castle Black. Jon goes to see Maester Aemon, finding him cutting meat to serve to the ravens.\nJon Snow:  Sam said you wanted to see me?\nMaester Aemon:  l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?\nJon Snow:  No.\nMaester Aemon:  So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?\nJon Snow:  He would do whatever was right, no matter what.\nMaester Aemon:  Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?\nJon Snow:  Sam told you.\nMaester Aemon:  We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose.\nJon Snow:  And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?\nMaester Aemon:  Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know.\nJon Snow:  You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.\nMaester Aemon:  The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South: the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless, blind, frail. But when l heard they had killed my brother's son and his poor son and the children! Even the little children.\nJon Snow:  Who are you?\nMaester Aemon:  My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King.\nJon Snow:  You're Aemon Targaryen.\nMaester Aemon:  l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have.\n\n\n------------------------------\nAcross the Narrow Sea, the Dothraki are on the move. Drogo leads them, but seems to have fainted. Daenerys rides right behind him.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) My lord  My sun and stars  Drogo.\nDrogo falls off his horse.\nKhal Drogo:  (in Dothraki) My horse \nCohollo:  (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood \nKhal Drogo:  (in Dothraki) No, l must ride.\nQotho:  (in Dothraki) He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here.\nQotho:  (in Dothraki) This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.\nQotho:  (in Dothraki) You do not command me, Khaleesi.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.\nQotho:  (in Dothraki) The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.\nQotho:  (in Dothraki) Hyah! Hyah!\n\n---------------------\nAt the Lannister camp, Tywin is presiding over lunch/war meeting. Tyrion gets there while everyone s already seated and eating.\nKevan Lannister:  Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.\nTywin Lannister:  The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.\nTyrion Lannister:  Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.\nTywin Lannister:  l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.\nKevan Lannister:  The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided.\nTyrion Lannister:  Shagga likes axes.\nTywin Lannister:  When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.\nTyrion Lannister:  The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?\nKevan Lannister:  They do seem rather ferocious.\nTyrion Lannister:  Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.\nTywin Lannister:  When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.\nTyrion Lannister:  Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.\nTywin Lannister:  There'll be no more discussion on the matter.\nTyrion Lannister:  lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords.\n\nBack at his tent, Tyrion finds Bronn there with a woman (a prostitute) waiting there too.\nTyrion Lannister:  Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?\nBronn:  l took her.\nTyrion Lannister:  Took her? From whom?\nBronn:  From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.\nTyrion Lannister:  And he didn't have anything to say about it?\nBronn:  He said something.\nTyrion Lannister:  Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.\nBronn:  Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one.\nBronn leaves. Tyrion addresses the prostitute.\nTyrion Lannister:  Who are you?\nProstitute:  Who would you like me to be?\nTyrion Lannister:  What did your mother call you?\nProstitute:  Shae. What did your mother call you?\nTyrion Lannister:  My mother died giving birth to me.\nShae:  ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?\nTyrion Lannister:  What sort of accent is that?\nShae:  Foreign.\nTyrion Lannister:  For-\nShae:  What do you want from me?\nTyrion Lannister:  What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.\nShae:  And what do l get?\nTyrion Lannister:  One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular.\nShae:  Who told you this? Women you paid?\nTyrion Lannister:  And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?\nShae gets undressed and kisses Tyrion.\nShae:  Let's start with your last night in this world.\n\n------------------------------\n\nBack across the Narrow Sea. Drogo is mumbling incoherently in Dothraki (no subtitles provided) inside a tent, Daenerys by his side.\n\nJorah Mormont: Khaleesi.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.\nJorah removes an herbal treatment from Drogo s wound, revealing it has become infected.\nJorah Mormont:  He will die tonight, Khaleesi.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  He can't. He can't. l won't let him.\nJorah Mormont:  Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  l won't leave him.\nJorah Mormont:  He's already gone, Khaleesi.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo.\nJorah Mormont:  This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  l won't leave him.\nMirri Maz Duur enters the tent, and bows to Daenerys. Qotho comes to check on Drogo too, with a few other bloodriders at the entrance.\nMirri Maz Duur:  The wound has festered.\nQotho:  (in Dothraki) You did this, witch. (pulls a dagger out of its sheath)\nDaenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Stop it! l don't want her hurt.\nQotho:  (in Dothraki) No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.\nJorah Mormont:  (in Dothraki) Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.\nQotho:  (in Dothraki) Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.\nQotho:  (in Dothraki) The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.\nQotho and the other Dothraki leave.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.\nJorah Mormont:  l think you're right.\nJorah leaves the tent.\nMirri Maz Duur:  You've saved me once more.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  And now you must save him.\nMirri Maz Duur:  He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some   some magic.\nMirri Maz Duur:  There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Do it. Save him.\nMirri Maz Duur:  There is a price.\nDaenerys Targaryen:   You'll have gold, whatever you want.\nMirri Maz Duur:  lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  My death?\nMirri Maz Duur:  No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse.\nDaenerys signals to Irri, who leaves to find the horse. We cut to the horse being taken by a rope into to the tent.\nRakharo:  Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch.\nDaenerys Targaryen:   Kill her and you kill your khal.\nRakharo:  This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.\nMirri Maz Duur starts an incantation\nMirri Maz Duur:  Go. Now.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Take her and leave. Take her!\nMirri Maz Duur:  You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight.\nDaenerys caresses Drogo s forehand as she moves to leave.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  No one will enter.\nMirri Maz Duur slits the horse s throat. Blood spills all over Drogo s chest and Daenerys  face.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Bring him back to me.\nDaenerys leaves the tent as the horse collapses to the ground, dead. Jorah comes to her.\nWhat have you done?\nDaenerys Targaryen:  l have to save him.\nWe could have been 10 miles away from here by now, on the way to Asshai. You would have been safe.\nQotho:  (in Dothraki) This must not be.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) This must be.\nQotho:  (in Dothraki) Witch.\nRakharo:  (in Dothraki) Nothing good will come of this.\nRakharo tries to talk to Qotho, but gets sucker punched in the face.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) No, you can't.\nQotho unsheaths his dagger and moves past Daenerys, pushing her towards the ground. Daenerys hits the ground with her belly.\nIrri:  Khaleesi!\nJorah Mormont:  (in Dothraki) No further, horselord.\nDaenerys starts moaning in pain, while we hear Mirri Maz Duur s incantations in the background. Qotho turns around and lunges towards Jorah. The two fight, but Jorah gains the upper hand and kills him with a sword blow to the face.\nJorah Mormont:  Are you hurt?\nDaenerys Targaryen: The baby  \nJorah Mormont:  Hmm?\nDaenerys Targaryen:   is coming.\nJorah Mormont:  Fetch the midwives.\nRakharo:  They will not come. They say she is cursed.\nJorah Mormont:  They'll come or l'll have their heads.\nRakharo:  The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.\nJorah moves inside the tent with Daenerys in his arms, as screams and incantations from the inside start getting louder and louder in tone.\n\n-----------------------\nAt the Lannister camp, Tyrion, Bronn and Shae are drinking together inside Tyrion s tent at night, before the battle.\n\nShae:  Are you in agony, my lion?\nTyrion Lannister:  No.\nShae:  You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.\nTyrion Lannister:  Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?\nShae:  Just used to it.\nBronn:   Drink.\nTyrion Lannister:  Let's play a new game.\nBronn:  There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.\nTyrion Lannister:  Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?\nBronn:  Not if you win.\nTyrion Lannister:  No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at.\nShae:  What are you good at?\nTyrion Lannister:  l happen to be a great judge of character.\nBronn:  This sounds like a boring game.\nTyrion Lannister:  lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying.\nShae:  l don't want to play this game.\nTyrion Lannister:  Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.\nBronn drinks.\nBronn:  But my mother hit harder.\nTyrion Lannister:  You killed your first man before you were 12.\nBronn:  lt was a woman. (Tyrion drinks. Shae looks at Bronn, surprised.) She swung an axe at me.\nTyrion Lannister:  You've been north of the Wall.\nShae:  What brought you up there?\nBronn:  Work.\nTyrion Lannister:  And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. (Tyrion drinks) Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.\nShae:  l don't want to play.\nTyrion Lannister:  lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.\nShae:  Drink.\nTyrion drinks.\nTyrion Lannister:  All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.\nShae:  Drink.\nTyrion Lannister:  And we've established the rules about lying?\nShae:  Drink!\nTyrion drinks.\nTyrion Lannister:  You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.\nBronn:  The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.\nTyrion Lannister:  So, specifics  You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?\nShae:  Drink.\nTyrion Lannister:  Are you sure  \nShae:  Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head.\nTyrion Lannister:  My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.\nShae:  My turn.\nTyrion Lannister:  Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.\nShae:  Who were you in love with?\nTyrion Lannister:  That's not how the game works.\nShae:  l don't care the way the game works.\nBronn:  Our lord here used to be married.\nShae:  Married?\nTyrion Lannister:  How did you hear that?\nBronn:  You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.\nTyrion Lannister:  Another night, perhaps.\nShae:  Not another night. This night.\nTyrion Lannister:  lt's not a pleasant story.\nShae:  Oh, maybe l will cry.\nBronn:  l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.\nTyrion Lannister:  So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed.\nBronn:  For three chickens, l should hope so.\nTyrion Lannister:  lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.\nBronn:  Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.\nTyrion Lannister:  Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.\nBronn:  l would have killed the man who did that to me.\nShae:  You should have known she was a whore.\nTyrion Lannister:  Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.\nShae:  A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.\nTyrion Lannister:  As l said, l was young and stupid.\nShae:  You are still young and stupid.\nShae starts kissing Tyrion, causing Bronn to leave the tent. The next day, the Lannisters ride to battle; Bronn returns to Tyrion s tent to wake him and Shae up.\nTyrion Lannister:  What is it? What do you want?\nBronn:  You're sleeping through the war.\nTyrion Lannister:  What?\nBronn:  They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.\nTyrion Lannister:  Get my squire!\nBronn:  You don't have a squire.\nTyrion Lannister:  lf l die, weep for me.\nShae:  You'll be dead. How will you know?\nTyrion Lannister:  l'll know.\nTyrion leaves the tent, fully armoured.\nLannister soldier : Watch out! Move!\nLannister soldier : Out of the way! Move aside!\nBronn:  Stay low.\nTyrion Lannister:  Stay low?\nBronn:  lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.\nTyrion Lannister:  l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!\nTribesmen of the Vale (chanting): Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!\nTyrion Lannister:  To battle!\nTyrion rides to battle with the rest, but turns around quickly after and is hit with a mace from one of the Tribesmen. He passes out. Later, we cut to the end of the battle   dead bodies and swords piling on the ground. Tyrion wakes up to find Bronn talking to him as he s carried on a wheelbarrow.\nBronn:  You're a shit warrior.\nTyrion Lannister:  l'm alive?\nBronn:  You're alive.\nTyrion Lannister:  Did we win?\nBronn:  We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.\nTyrion Lannister:  How did our tribesmen do?\nBronn:  Yeah, good.\nTyrion Lannister:  lt's nice to see them getting along.\nTywin shows up next to them, fully armoured and on horseback.\nTywin Lannister:  You're wounded.\nTyrion Lannister:  Good of you to notice. l hear we won.\nTywin Lannister:  Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand].\nTyrion Lannister:  Did we get the Stark boy, at least?\nTywin Lannister:  He wasn't here.\nTyrion Lannister:  Where was he?\nTywin Lannister:  With his other 18,000 men.\nTyrion Lannister:  And where are they?\n\n--------------\nWe cut to Catelyn and Rodrik Cassel overlooking the Trident from a safe distance at higher ground.\nRodrik Cassel:  We should go, my lady.\nCatelyn Stark:  No!\nRodrik Cassel:  My lady!\nStark bannermen:  Hyah! Hyah!\nThe Stark host arrives at the clearing. Robb is amongst them, and he comes carrying a tied and bound Jaime Lannister.\nRobb Stark:  By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.\nJaime Lannister:  Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it.\nCatelyn Stark:  lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.\nJaime Lannister:  l've lost them too, l'm afraid.\nTheon Greyjoy:  Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.\nRobb Stark:  He's more use to us alive than dead.\nCatelyn Stark:  Take him away and put him in irons.\nJaime Lannister:  We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.\nRobb Stark:  lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.\nGreatjon Umber:  Come on, pretty man.\nRobb Stark:  l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.\nTheon Greyjoy:  The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.\nRobb Stark:  Aye. But the dead won't hear them. (making a speech to his bannermen) One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.\n\n-----------------------\nAt King s Landing, Arya is chasing down pigeons on the street while staying hidden from the Kingsguard. She catches one and snaps its neck. Soon afterwards, she sees a baker s stall with pastries on display.\n\nArya Stark:  Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.\nKing s Landing Baker:  Three coppers.\nArya Stark:  How about a nice fat pigeon?\nKing s Landing Baker:  Oh, piss off now. Go on.\nArya Stark:  Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?\nKing s Landing Baker:  Piss off!\nEveryone starts walking up the street, leaving Arya confused. Two street urchins run past her up the stairs.\nArya Stark:  Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?\nStreet Urchin:  They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.\nArya Stark:  Who?\nStreet Urchin:  The Hand of the King.\nArya follows the crowd to the Sept of Baelor. She climbs up the pedestal of Baelor s statue to get a better view of her surroundings. We cut to Ned Stark being taken from the sept and into the courtyard, in full view of the gathered populace; Baelor s statue is seen on the background to his left. Ned catches Arya s eye at the foot of the statue.\nPopulace:  Traitor! Coward!\nNed is taken across the populace and runs into Yoren of the Night s Watch.\nEddark Stark:  Baelor!\nYoren looks towards the statue knowingly.\nPopulace:  Traitor! Traitor!\nNed is taken to a raised platform where Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey, Littlefinger are standing. Sansa smiles warmly at her father as he addresses the crowd.\nEddark Stark:  I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say: Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, by the grace of all the Gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.\nGrand Maester Pycelle:  As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?\nJoffrey Baratheon:  My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!\nThe townsfolk roar with approval; Arya leaves the pedestal and runs towards the commotion. Sansa gets visibly distraught and starts yelling as a member of the Kingsguard holds her back.\n\nSansa Stark:  No, stop! Please, someone stop him!\nCersei Baratheon: My son, this is madness.\nPopulace: Put him down!\nVarys runs to the platform to talk to Cersei and Joffrey, Ilyn Payne puts on his executioner s mask. Arya marches towards the courtyard but is grabbed by the arm by Yoren.\nYoren: Don't look!\nArya Stark:  Let me go.\nYoren:  Shut your mouth. Look at me.\nSansa Stark:  Stop him, stop!\n\nFrom Ned s perspective, the roars of the crowd become almost silent; he looks towards Baelor s statue but finds no one there. He lowers his head in recognition of his fate as the sound of Payne s longsword cuts through the hushed silence. We see the sword swing until it reaches his head, with a direct cut to Arya as Yoren prevents her from seeing the actual execution. Arya looks at the sky; a flock of pigeons flies away from the courtyard as she holds her head against Yoren s chest; she sighs heavily, and the screen cuts to black.\n\n", "episode_8": "\n\nEntering King's Landing, we see Syrio Forel dancing with Arya.\n\nSyrio Forel:  Yah! Left high, left low.\nHow ironic it seems, how peacefully Arya and Syrio are dancing, near the Throne room, the Kings Guard fights a few Stark men.\nGoing back again at Arya's dancing training.\n\nSyrio Forel:  Right low, lunge right.\n\nOutside in a courtyard, a few Stark stewards are packing and bringing out the Stark family's belongings.\n\nSteward of House Stark:  If you break anything, the Septa will have my head. What is...\n\nThe stewards are being slaughtered by the Kingsguard.\nGoing back inside the Red Keep, Sansa is walking down a hallway with her Septa.\n\nSepta Mordane:  Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.\nHow she could forget...\nSansa Stark:  She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.\nShe's with him every morning. She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.\nShe's so clumsy.\nSepta Mordane:  Hush! Go back to your room.\nBar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.\nSansa Stark:  What is it? What's happening?\nSepta Mordane:  Do as I told you. Run!\n\nBack at Arya's training.\n\nSyrio Forel:  This way! Left, right.\nRah! Now you are dead.\nArya Stark:  You said right, but you went left.\nSyrio Forel:  And now you are a dead girl.\nArya Stark:  Only 'cause you lied.\nSyrio Forel:  My tongue lied.\nMy eyes shouted the truth.\nYou were not seeing.\nArya Stark:  I was so. I watched, but you...\nSyrio Forel:  Watching is not seeing, dead girl.\nThe seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.\nThe Kingsguard approaches.\nMeryn Trant:  Arya Stark, come with us.\nYour father wants to see you.\nSyrio Forel:  And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.\nMeryn Trant:  Mind your place, dancing master.\nThis is no concern of yours.\nArya Stark:  My father wouldn't send you.\nAs she picks up her wooden stick from the ground, she says.\nArya Stark:  And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.\nMaryn Trant:  Take her.\nSyrio Forel:  Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?\nKings guard:  Get out of my way, little man.\nSyrio Forel:  I am Syrio Forel.\nKings guard:  Foreign bastard.\nThe Kings guard draws his sword. Before he can strike, Syrio hits him with his wooden stick. Knocking him out.\nSyrio Forel:  And you will be speaking to me with more respect.\nMeryn Trant:  Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.\nSyrio Forel:  Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.\nRun to your father.\nSyrio Forel fights three Kings guards at once, eventually knocking them all out.\nMeryn Trant:  Bloody oafs.\nSyrio Forel:  Be gone now, Arya.\nArya Stark:  Come with me. Run.\nSyrio Forel:  The first sword of Braavos does not run.\nMeryn Trant strikes Syrio, a short duel takes place. Eventually Meryn Trant cuts Syrio Forel's wooden sword into pieces.\nSyrio Forel:  What do we say to the God of death?\nArya Stark:  Not today.\nSyrio Forel:  Go.\n\nArya Stark runs off and hears a bunch of screams from down the hallway. She looks concerned.\nArya Stark:  Not today. Not today.\n\nBack on the other side of the Red Keep, Sansa runs on, but is stopped by a familiar face.\n\nSansa Stark:  Stay away from me.\nI'll tell my father. I'll...I'll tell the Queen.\nSandor Clegane:  Who do you think sent me?\n\nBack to Arya, we see that she has arrived at the slaughtered stewards. She sees her belongings lying on the ground.\n\nArya Stark:  Needle.\nA stable boy appears.\nStable Boy:  There she is.\nArya Stark:  What do you want?\nStable Boy:  I want you, wolf girl. Come here.\nArya Stark:  Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.\nStable Boy:  She'll reward me, the Queen!\nArya Stark:  Stay away!\nAccidentally, she turns around sliding Needle through the stable boys belly. Her first kill is a fact.\nShook as she is, she runs off.\nIn the dark dungeon cells of Kings Landing we see Ned Stark. He sees a little light approaches him. After a short while it is clear that it's Varys, whom is holding a torch.\nLord Varys:  Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.\nNed Stark:  Varys.\nLord Varys:  I promise you it isn't poisoned.\nWhy is it no one ever trusts the eunuch? Not so much, My Lord.\nI would save the rest, if I were you.\nHide it. Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.\nNed Stark:  What about my daughters?\nLord Varys:  The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.\nEven my little birds cannot find her.\nNed Stark:  And Sansa?\nLord Varys:  Still engaged to Joffrey.\nCersei will keep her close. The rest of your household though, all dead, it grieves me to say.\nI do so hate the sight of blood.\nNed Stark:  You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.\nLord Varys:  And would again, My Lord.\nI was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.\nWhen you look at me do you see a hero?\nWhat madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?\nNed Stark:  The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.\nLord Varys:  Ah, the children. It is always the innocents who suffer.\nIt wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.\nThe wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.\nI trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?\nNed Stark:  The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.\nLord Varys:  The wrong brother sadly.\nAnd lost to her. Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.\nNed Stark:  If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.\nLord Varys:  Not today, My Lord.\nVarys is about to walk away, while being stopped by Ned one last time.\nNed Stark:  Tell me something, Varys.\nWho do you truly serve?\nLord Varys:  The Realm, My Lord.\nSomeone must.\nVarys leaves the dungeons.\nAt Castle Black a corpses are being carried inside. Some of the Night's brothers are inspecting the two bodies.\n\nJeor Mormont:  It's Othor, without a doubt.\nOthell Yarwyck:  The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.\nJeor Mormont:  Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?\nJon Snow:  Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say.\nJeor Mormont:  Mmm.\nSamwell Tarly:  The smell.\nOthell Yarwyck:  What smell?\nSamwell Tarly:  There is none.\nIf they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?\nJon Snow:  We should burn them.\nOthell Yarwyck:  Snow's not wrong, My Lord.\nFire will do for them. The Wildling way.\nJeor Mormont:  I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.\nYou may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.\nGet them inside.\nOthell Yarwyck:  You heard him.\nSer Alliser: Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers. A raven from King's Landing.\nNights Watch brother:  Come on, move 'em out.\n\nJon Snow is summoned to Jeor Mormont's chambers. While entering the room, a conversation starts.\n\nJeor Mormont:  Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.\nThe King is dead.\nJon Snow:  Is there any word of my father?\nJeor Mormont:  Sit.\nLord Stark has been charged with treason.\nThey say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.\nJon points to the letter, as he wants to read it. Jeor Mormont hands it over. When reading the letter, Jon stands up and wants to walk away.\nJeor Mormont:  I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.\nYour duty lies here now.\nJon Snow:  My sisters were in King's Landing too.\nJeor Mormont:  I'm sure they'll be treated gently.\nJon walks out.\nDeep inside the Red Keep, Sansa is having a conversation with Cersei.\nGrand Maester Pycelle, Varys and Littlefinger being in their presence.\n\nLord Varys:  Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.\nGrand Maester Pycelle:  King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.\nSansa Stark:  He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey.\nHe wouldn't. Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.\nSend for my father. He'll tell you, the King was his friend.\nCersei Lannister:  Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.\nWe know that.\nYet you are the daughter of a traitor.\nHow can I allow you to marry my son?\nGrand Maester Pycelle:  A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.\nShe is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?\nSansa Stark:  No, I'm not.\nI'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.\nI'll be a Queen just like you, I promise.\nI won't hatch anything.\nPetyr Baelish:  The girl is innocent, Your Grace.\nShe should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.\nCersei Lannister:  Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest.\nWhat's his name?\nSansa Stark:  Robb.\nCersei Lannister:  Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.\nBest it comes from you.\nIf you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.\nTell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.\nSansa Stark:  If...if I could see my father, talk to him about...\nCersei Lannister:  You disappoint me, child.\nWe have told you of your father's treason.\nWhy would you want to speak to a traitor?\nSansa Stark:  I only meant that...what will happen to him?\nCersei Lannister:  That depends.\nSansa Stark:  On...on what?\nCersei Lannister:  On your brother. And on you.\nBack at Winterfell, Robb reads the letter Sansa sent.\nRobb Stark:  Treason? Sansa wrote this?\nMaester Luwin:  It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.\nYou are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.\nRobb Stark:  Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?\nMaester Luwin: This is a royal command, My Lord.\nIf you should refuse to obey...\nRobb Stark:  I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.\nBut not alone. Call the banners.\nMaester Luwin: All of them, My Lord?\nRobb Stark:  They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?\nMaester Luwin: They have.\nNow we see what their words are worth.\nMaester Luwin: Yeah.\nMaester Luwin walks off.\nTheon Greyjoy:  Are you afraid?\nRobb Stark:  I must be.\nTheon Greyjoy:  Good.\nRobb Stark:  Why is that good?\nTheon Greyjoy:  It means you're not stupid.\n\n\nAt the Eyrie, Catelyn rushes to Lysa's chambers. Upon arrival she angrily speaks.\nCatelyn Stark:  You've had this since dawn?\nLysa Arryn:  He sent it to me, not you.\nI've only shown it to you as a courtesy.\nCatelyn Stark:  A courtesy?! My husband has been taken prisoner.\nMy son intends to declare war.\nLysa Arryn:  A war? Your son against the Lannisters?\nYou should go to him. Teach him patience.\nCatelyn Stark:  Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience? He is your brother by law!\nDoes family mean nothing to you?\nLysa Arryn:  Family means everything to me.\nAnd I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.\nRobin Arryn:  I'm hungry.\nLysa Arryn:  Hush now, darling. You just ate.\nCatelyn Stark:  You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?\nRobin Arryn:  But I'm hungry!\nLysa Arryn:  Soon, love, soon.\nYou're always welcome here, sister.\nBut if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...\nCatelyn Stark:  That is what I ask.\nLysa Arryn:  Go on, sweet. Time for your bath. I'll feed you after.\nRobin walks out of the room.\nCatelyn Stark:  If you fear for the safety of your son...\nLysa Arryn:  Of course I fear for the safety of my son!\nAre you an idiot? They killed my husband.\nYou say they shoved your boy from a window.\nThese people will do anything.\nCatelyn Stark:  And that is why we have to stop them.\nLysa Arryn:  The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.\n\n\nBoth Tyrion and Bronn are seen walking through the hills of the Vale.\nBronn:  Will you shut up? There's hill tribes all around here.\nTyrion Lannister:  If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.\nBronn:  I should just take your food and leave you here.\nEh? What would you do then?\nTyrion Lannister:  Starve, most likely.\nBronn:  You don't think I'd do it, do you?\nTyrion Lannister:  What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Golden women?\nStick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.\nBut you knew that.\nThat is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.\nBronn:  Fair enough.\nBut don't go looking for me to bend the knee and \"My Lord\" you every time you take a shit.\nI'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.\nTyrion Lannister:  Though I would treasure your friendship.\nI'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.\nAnd if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out.\nRemember this: Whatever their price, I'll beat it.\nI like living.\n\nA while later, Tyrion and Bronn are seen near a campfire.\nBronn hears noises of approaching men and tries to warn Tyrion.\n\nBronn:  Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion.\nTyrion Lannister:  Come, share our fire.\nHelp yourselves to our goat.\nShagga:  When you meet your Gods, you tell them Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.\nTyrion Lannister:  I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.\nHow would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?\nTyrion Lannister:  In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.\nTake the half man.\nHe can dance for the children. Kill the other one.\nTyrion Lannister:  No no no no no! My, my House is rich and powerful.\nIf you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.\nShagga:  We have no use for a half man's promises.\nTyrion Lannister:  Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.\nWhat do the Stone Crows do? Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?\nAre those the best weapons you could steal? Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.\nLannister smiths shit better steel.\nShagga:  You think you can win us over with your trinkets?\nTyrion Lannister:  That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.\nBut if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets.\nI will give you this.\nTyrion makes a gesture.\nShagga:  What is \"this\"?\nTyrion Lannister:  The Vale of Arryn.\nThe Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.\nThe Lords of the Vale want me dead.\nI believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.\n\nIn Castle Black's kitchen, Jon and Sam are preparing a meal, while Ser Alliser approaches.\n\nSer Alliser:  Now there's a rare sight. Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.\nJon looks Alliser in his eyes. Silence occur for a few seconds. Then, suddenly Jon tries to strike Alliser, but is stopped by Pypar and Grenn.\nSamwell Tarly:  Jon, no! Jon, stop, put it down!\nSer Alliser:  Blood will always tell. You'll hang for this, bastard.\nSer Alliser had his fun and walks away, while Jeor Mormont saw the incident and walk towards Jon.\nJeor Mormont:  I told you not to do anything stupid. You're confined to quarters. Go.\nJon obeys and walks off.\n\nLater that night, Ghost alerts Jon. He seems to be uneasy. Jon wakes up and talks to Ghost.\n\nJon Snow:  Ghost, what's wrong? Is something out there?\nJon decides to get out of bed, gear up and opens the door. Ghost runs off towards Jeor Mormants room.\nMounting his door.\nJon Snow:  Commander?\nJon Snow:  Stay.\nGhost waits at the front door, while Jon walks in.\nJon Snow:  Hello?\nWho's there?\nLord Commander?\nAs soon as he walks through the door, the door shuts and the corpse of Othor attacks Jon. Jon tries to stab him with his dagger, but nothing seems to phase him. Jon pulls himself loose, draws his sword and cuts off Othor's other hand. Then Jon stabs Othor through the heart. Othor falls down. Suddenly Jeor Mormont arrives.\nJeor Mormont:  Snow!?\nJon Snow:  Commander!\nOthor gets back on his feet, pulling out Jon's sword out of his chest. Outside of the room, Ghost goes beserk, trying to get in.\nJon grabs Jeor's lantern and throws it at Othor. Othor catches fire.\nJon Snow:  Move move!\nJon grabs Jeor by his arm and flees inside a room, shutting the door.\n\n\nThe Khalasar have arrived the lands of Lhazar. Dany and her company walk through the burned area.\n\nDaenarys Stormborn:  What did they do?\nRakharo:  Lamb men make good slaves. Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers.\nAnd the slavers will give us gold...and silk and steel.\nDaenarys Stormborn:  I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.\nJorah Mormont:  Gold to hire ships, Princess. Ships to sail to Westeros.\nWhile walking a little further, Dany sees Dothraki men looting and holding Lhazareen captive.\nDaenarys Stormborn:  Jorah, make them stop.\nJorah Mormont:  Khaleesi?\nDaenarys Stormborn:  You heard me.\nJorah Mormont:  These men have shed blood for their Khal.\nNow they claim their rewards.\nRakharo:  She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor.\nIf her wailing offends the Khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue.\nJorah Mormont:  Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.\nDaenarys Stormborn:  I do not have a gentle heart, Ser. Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.\nJorah and Rhakharo both obey and run off, trying to stop the Khalasar, while freeing some Lhazareen.\nRhakharo:  Kash qoy qoyi thira disse. Me qorasokh anni!\nWhile Rhakharo argues with a Dothraki man, Jorah brings over a Lhazareen woman.\nJorah Mormont:  Come.\nDothraki Man:  Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!\nJorah Mormont:  What do you want done with them?\nDaenarys Stormborn:  Bring her to me. And those women there.\nJorah Mormont:  You cannot claim them all, Princess.\nDaenarys Stormborn:  I can, and I will.\n\nLeaving with a couple of Lhazareen women, Dany arrives at a covered courtyard, where Khal Drogo is having a discussion with Mago.\n\nMago:  Me Fati! Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!\nKhal Drogo:  Me vastoe hatif anni; ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.\nKhal Drogo:  Moon of my life. Mago says you have taken his spoils.\nA daughter of a lamb men, who was his to mount. Tell me the truth of this.\nDaenarys Stormborn:  Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars. I have claimed many daughters this day, so they cannot be mounted.\nKhal Drogo:  This is the way of war. These women are slaves now to do with as we please.\nDaenarys Stormborn:  It pleases me to keep them safe.\nIf your riders would mount them, let them take them for wifes.\nQotho:  Does the horse mate with the lamb?\nDaenarys Stormborn:  The dragons feeds on horse and lamb alike.\nMago:  You are a foreigner. You do not command me.\nDaenarys Stormborn:  I am Khaleesi. I do command you.\nKhal Drogo:  See how fierce she grows?\nThat is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world. Filling her with his fire.\nI will hear no more.\nMago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.\nMago spits on the ground and draws his sword.\nMago:  A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.\nWhen Qotho is trying to interfere, Khal Drogo calls him back.\nKhal Drogo:  Ohosa. Os.\nI will not have your body burned. I will not give you that honor.\nMago points out his sword and pushes it to Khal Drogo's chest.\nKhal Drogo grins, it doesn't seem to phase him. He continues talking.\nKhal Drogo:  The beetles will feed on your eyes.

Open your ears.\nBrann is trying to listen and looks up the Weirwood tree. He hears the wind blowing through the leaves.\nBrann Stark:  It's only the wind.\nWho do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?\nThey see you, boy. They hear you.\nYour brother will get no help from them where he's going.\nThe Old Gods have no power in the South.\nThe Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.\nHow can they watch when they have no eyes?\nSuddenly Hodor appears.\nIt appears he was bathing nearby, since he is bare naked holding a towel around his neck.\nOsha:  Well, there's a big man.\nHe has giants blood in him or I'm the Queen.\nBrann Stark:  Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.\nGo dress.\nHodor:  Hodor.\nHodor obeys and runs off.\nBrann Stark:  Are there really giants beyond the Wall?\nOsha:  Giants and worse than giants.\nI tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.\nAll these swords, they should be going North, boy.\nNorth, not south!\nThe cold winds are rising.\nLooking back up to the Weirwood tree, Brann hears the wind again.\n\n\nAt castle Black, the Night's Watch decided to burn the corpse of Othor, whom attacked Jeor Mormant.\nSam decided to share some knowledge.\n\nSamwell Tarly:  They were touched by White Walkers.\nThat's why they came back.\nThat's why their eyes turned blue.\nOnly fire will stop them.\nJon Snow:  How do you know that?\nSamwell Tarly:  I read about it in a book. A very old book in Maester Aemon's library.\nJon Snow:  What else did the book say?\nSamwell Tarly:  The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.\nAnd when they wake up...\nPypar:  And when they wake up, what?\nSam looks to the top of the Wall.\nSamwell Tarly:  I hope The Wall is high enough.\nSeemingly worried, the rest of the lot also look towards the top of the Wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatelyn Stark and Ser Rodrik both arrive at Robb Starks camp.\n\nRodrik Cassel:  Summer snows, My Lady.\nCatelyn Stark:  Robb's brought the North with him.\nEntering Robbs tent, we see Robb and his banner men discussing tactics.\nRobb Stark:  The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.\nAnd Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.\nOur scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.\nGreatjon Umber:  One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts ten times this large.\nRobb Stark:  Mother!\nCatelyn Stark:  You look well.\nGreatjon Umber:  Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.\nTheon Greyjoy:  We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.\nCatelyn Stark:  I had not thought to be here.\nI would speak with my son alone.

Who were those men I saw here?\nRobb Stark:  None of them are Starks.\nCatelyn Stark:  All of them are seasoned in battle.\nRobb Stark:  If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...\nCatelyn Stark:  Oh, would that I could.\nRobb Stark:  There was a letter. From Sansa.\nCatelyn Stark:  From the Queen, you mean.\nThere's no mention of Arya.\nRobb Stark:  No.\nCatelyn Stark:  How many men do you have?\nRobb Stark:  18,000. If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...\nCatelyn Stark:  you would never be allowed to leave. No.\nOur best hope, our only hope, is that you can defeat them in the field.\nRobb Stark:  And if I lose?\nCatelyn Stark:  Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children, when the Mad King fell?\nRobb Stark:  They were butchered in their sleep.\nCatelyn Stark:  On the orders of Tywin Lannister. And the years have not made him kinder.\nIf you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.\nRobb Stark:  Well, that makes it simple then.\nCatelyn Stark:  I suppose it does.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nArriving at the foot of the Lannister camp, Tyrion, Bronn, Shagga and the hill tribe, decide to stop for a short while.\nA conversation follows.\n\nTyrion Lannister:  From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.\nShagga:  Best for Tyrion son of Tywin. Not best for me.\nIf the half man betrays us, Shagga son of Dolf will cut off his manhood...\nTyrion Lannister:  And feed it to the goats, yes.\nAll right then. Time to meet my father.\nMoving into the Lannister camp, Shagga and the hill tribe follow.\nUpon entering the Tywin Lannister's tent, we see Kevan Lannister and Tywin sitting at a table, scheming.\nKevan Lannister  Tyrion.\nTyrion Lannister:  Uncle. Father.\nTywin Lannister:  The rumors of your demise were unfounded.\nTyrion Lannister:  Sorry to disappoint you.\nTywin Lannister:  And who are these Companions of yours?\nTywin Lannister:  This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows.\nTimett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.\nThis fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.\nAnd here we have Bronn son of...\nBronn:  You wouldn't know him.\nTyrion Lannister:  May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister.\nLord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West. Kind of you to go to war for me.\nTywin Lannister:  You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake.\nYour brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.\nTyrion Lannister:  We have our differences, Jaime and I.\nHe's braver. I'm better looking.\nJamie Lannister:  He's been covering himself in glory.\nKevan Lannister:  Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.\nTyrion Lannister:  And the Starks? Lord Eddard?\nTywin Lannister:  Is our hostage.\nHe will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.\nTyrion Lannister:  How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?\nTywin Lannister:  Robert Baratheon is dead.\nJoffrey rules in King's Landing.\nTyrion Lannister:  My sister rules, you mean.\nKevan Lannister:  Stark's son has called his banners.\nHe moves south with a strong host.\nTywin Lannister:  A green boy.\nOne taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs.\nTyrion Lannister:  Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.\nYou'd like him.\nWhile we're on the subject of war, I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.\nWe shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces...\nSuddenly a messenger appears, interrupting Tyrion's request.\nMessenger:  If it please My Lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.\nTywin Lannister:  The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.\nSo be it. Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.\nAnd send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.\nKevan Lannister:  At once, My Lord.\nTywin Lannister:  It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.\nRide with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.\nShagga:  Only if the half man fights with us.\nUntil we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.\nTywin looks over to Tyrion. Tyrion looks shooked.\nBack at Robbs camp, inside his tent we see Robb and his men plotting.\n\nRodrik Cassal:  The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.\nWe need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage.\nGreatjon Umber:  No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.\nDo that and the River Lords will join us.\nRobb Stark:  To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.\nTheon Greyjoy:  Lord Frey controls that bridge.\nYour father's bannerman.\nCatelyn Stark:  \"The late Lord Frey\" my father calls him.\nAt the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.\nSome men takes their oaths more seriously than others.\nMeanwhile, outside a few Stark men captured a scout, leading him to Robbs tent.\nTheon Greyjoy:  Robb's right.\nWe need that bridge.\nGreatjon Umber:  So what's it gonna be? Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?\nStark guard:  Your pardon, my lords.\nWe've captured a Lannister scout.\nTheon covers the map with pawns\nGreatjon Umber:  Don't worry, lad.\nHe won't be leaving this tent with his head.\nRobb Stark:  Where did you find him?\nStark guard:  In the brush above the encampment.\nHe looked to be counting.\nRobb walks towards the Lannister scout.\nRobb Stark:  How high did you get?\nLannister scout:  20,000. Maybe more.\nRodrik Cassel  You don't have to do this yourself.\nYour father would understand.\nRobb Stark:  My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.\nAnd he understands honor and courage.\nLet him go.\nCatelyn Stark:  Robb.\nRobb looks over his shoulder with a stare. Catelyn understands and looks down in regret.\nRobb Stark:  Tell Lord Tywin, Winter is coming for him.\nTo find out if he really does shit gold.\nLannister scout:  Yes, My Lord. Thank you, My Lord.\nGreatjon Umber:  Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?\nRobb Stark:  You call me boy again.\nGreatjon Umber wants to taunt Robb.\nRobb Stark:  Go on.\nGreatjon Umber:  Oi.\nFrustrated, Greatjon Umber walks out of the tent.\nIn Kings Landing, we see Ned Stark asleep in the dungeons, a guard on patrol kicks his feet waking him up. Then walks on.\nMeanwhile, in the Throne room, new roles are being announced by Grand Maester Pycelle.\nGrand Maester Pycelle:  It is also the wish of His Grace, that his loyal servant Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch...\nWhile Grand Maester Pycelle is speaking, Sansa walks by a few familiar faces.\nSansa Stark:  Ser Aron.\nGrand Maester Pycelle:  Be at once raised to the rank of Lord.\nSansa Stark:  Lord Gyles.\nGrand Maester Pycelle:  And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him, until the end of time.\nIn the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.\nLastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.\nCersei Lannister:  Ser Barristan Selmy.\nBarristan Selmy approaches.\nBarristan Selmy:  Your Grace, I am yours to command.\nCersei Lannister:  Rise, Ser Barristan.\nYou may remove your helm.\nYou have served the Realm long and faithfully.\nEvery man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.\nBut it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.\nIt is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.\nBarristan Selmy:  Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.\nOur vows are taken for life. Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.\nCersei Lannister:  Whose death, Ser Barristan?

I know My Lord father must regret what he did.\nHe was King Robert's friend and he loved him.\nYou all know he loved him.\nHe never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.\nThey must have lied to him. Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.\nThey must have lied!\nKing Joffrey:  He said I wasn't the King. Why did he say that?\nSansa Stark:  He was badly hurt.\nMaester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.\nHe wasn't himself. Otherwise h never would have said it.\nLord Varys:  A child's faith Such sweet innocence.\nAnd yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.\nGrand Maester Pycelle:  Treason is treason!\nKing Joffrey:  Anything else?\nSansa Stark:  If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.\nKing Joffrey:  Your sweet words have moved me.\nBut your father has to confess.\nHe has to confess and say that I'm the King or there'll be no mercy for him.\nSansa Stark:  He will.\n\n", "episode_32": "\n\nTansy!\nTansy!

Tell him!\nLord of Light, protect us,\nfor the night is dark and full of terrors.\nDid you see? Their souls.\nIt was their souls.\nOur lord took them. Did you see?\nLord Florent was your brother by law.\nHe was an infidel.\nHe worshipped the gods of his fathers\nand their fathers before him.\nThey were the gods of your fathers, too.\nI ordered him to tear down his idols.\nHe disobeyed.\nHow many ships did he bring to your 'cause?\nHow many men?\nA good deal more than you.\nDid you see, Ser Davos?\nThey're with our lord now.\nTheir sins all burned away. Did you see?\nI'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen.\nMeat's off.\nOur larders are almost empty.\nServe fish, then. We're on an island.\nYou hate fish.\nI hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same.\nWhen Storm's End was under siege and I was starving,\nStannis boiled soup for me from books.\nThe binding glue is made from horses.\nOne morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach.\nI've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull.\n- Do you remember? - Of course I remember.\nHave you ever known true hunger, my lady?\nIt's all I knew when I was a child.\nUntil you found the Lord of Light?\nUntil he found me.\nI fear for our daughter's soul.\nEvery mother should fear for her child's soul.\n- She's a stubborn little beast. - She's a child.\nYou barely know her.\nYou think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit.\nShe's sullen and stubborn and sinful.\nWhy else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face?\nShe needs the rod.\nShe's my daughter. You will not strike her.\nAs you command.\nPerhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.\nCome in.\nWere you sleeping, Princess?\nDid you watch the ceremony on the beach?\nI heard it.\nAnd it frightened you?\nSer Axel was my uncle.\nHe was always kind to me.\nThey're in a better place now, Princess.\nThe fire cleansed them of the sins of the world.\nBut they screamed.\nWomen scream when they give birth.\nAfterward they are filled with joy.\nAfterward they aren't ash and bone.\nYou have so many questions, don't you?\nSo did I when I was a child.\nI was much like you.\nOnly I wasn't a princess.\nAnd you didn't have this.\nNo.\nBut I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me.\nWhat do you know of the gods?\nI read \"The Seven-Pointed Star.\"\nLies and fables.\nSeptons speak of seven gods.\nThere are but two...\na god of light and love and joy\nand a god of darkness, evil, and fear.\nEternally at war.\nThere are no seven heavens and no seven hells?\nThere's only one hell, Princess.\nThe one we live in now.\nHodor.\nWhy did you wake me?\nYou've been gone for hours.\nI was hungry.\nWe're all hungry.\nI was just eating.\nSummer was eating.\nYour body can't live on the food your wolf consumes.\nSpending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous.\nYou're not a direwolf, Bran.\nMust be glorious, though.\nTo run, to leap, to hunt.\nTo be whole.\nI know that's tempting,\nbut if you're trapped in Summer for too long,\nyou'll forget what it was to be human.\nYou'd forget us, Bran.\nYou'd forget your mother and father.\nYou'd forget your brothers and sisters.\nYou'd forget Winterfell.\nYou'd forget you.\nAnd if we lose you, we lose everything.\nHodor, take me to the tree.\nLook for me...\nbeneath the tree.\nHe saw us.\nNorth.\nI know where we have to go.\nLet it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell\nand Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon\nare one heart, one flesh, one soul.\nCursed be he\nwho would seek to tear them asunder.\nWith this kiss, I pledge my love.\nWe have a new queen.\nBetter her than you.\n- Bit much, wouldn't you say? - It feels proportionate.\n- Proportionate to what? - The expected extravagance.\nPeople who spend their money on this sort of nonsense\ntend not to have it for long.\nYou ought to try enjoying something before you die.\nYou might find it suits you.\nNot now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking.\nAnyway, I don't know what you're complaining about.\nI'm paying my share.\nShall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies\nto commemorate your generosity?\nNo, your heartfelt thank-you is it's own reward.\nI would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long.\nWars are rather expensive.\n\"The Iron Bank will have it's due.\"\nHow they love to remind everyone.\nAlmost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.\nI'm not worried about the Iron Bank.\nWe both know you're smarter than that.\nCome, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.\nAll taken care of.\n- You saw her board the ship? - Aye, she's on it.\nYou saw the ship sail away?\nNo one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys.\nHow do you know?\nBecause if someone follows me without an invitation,\nI'm the last person they ever follow.\nThere's someone following you?\nShe's gone.\nI know you don't want to believe it, but she is.\nNow, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing.\nHello.\n- Hello. - Not you.\nYou look exquisite, child.\nThe wind has been at you, though.\nI haven't had the opportunity to tell you\nhow sorry I was to hear about your brother.\nWar is war, but killing a man at a wedding,\nhorrid.\nWhat sort of monster would do such a thing?\nAs if men need more reasons to fear marriage.\nMy lady. My lady.\nLord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that.\nPerhaps if your pauper husband\nwere to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes,\nhe might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit.\nNow that peace has come and all is right with the world,\nit would do you good to see some of it.\nYou must excuse me.

Off you go.\nMy love, why don't we make the announcement?\nEveryone.\nThe queen would like to say a few words.\nWe are so fortunate\nto enjoy this marvelous food and drink.\nNot all among us are so lucky.\nTo thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end,\nKing Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers\nfrom our feast be given to the poorest in his city.\nYou're an example to us all.\nSer Jaime, I'm very sorry.\nSer Loras, it's quite all right.\nYour sister looks very beautiful.\nAs does yours.\nSo, looking forward to your wedding?\nYes, very much.\nOur fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.\nThey certainly are.\nPerhaps they should get married.\nIf you were to marry Cersei,\nshe'd murder you in your sleep.\nIf you somehow managed to put a child in her first,\nshe'd murder him, too,\nlong before he drew his first breath.\nLuckily for you, none of this will happen\nbecause you'll never marry her.\nAnd neither will you.\nYour Grace. My king.\n- My queen. - Lady Brienne.\nSo good of you to come.\nI'm no lady, Your Grace.\nDid you just bow?\nApologies, Your Grace.\nI never did master the curtsy.\nYou're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.\nThat's not true, my love.

Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother.\nMust be exciting to flit from one camp to the next\nserving whichever lord or lady you fancy.\nI don't serve your brother, Your Grace.\nBut you love him.\nYour Grace.\nNo, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally.\n- She'll do no such thing. - Oh, Your Grace.\nYes, well, this young lady sought my advice...\nYou should see Qyburn. He's quite good.\n- Your Grace. - Qyburn? Deplorable man.\nBrought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.\nMore repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?\nYour Grace, I am a man of learning.\nMy little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him.\nWhat do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?\nI never meant to annoy anyone.\nBut you are. You annoy me right now.\nEvery breath you draw in my presence annoys me.\nSo here's what I want you to do.\nI want you to leave my presence.\nLeave this wedding right now.\nGo to the kitchens and instruct them\nthat all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.\nYour Grace, Queen Margaery...\nThe queen is telling you\nthe leftovers will feed the dogs\nor you will.\nA gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.\nYou're in rather a good mood.\n- I suppose I am. - I won't ask why.\n- Small pleasures. - Your Grace.

My lady.\nCharmed.\nCan't say I've ever met a Sand before.\nWe are everywhere in Dorne.\nI have 10,000 brothers and sisters.\nBastards are born of passion, aren't they?\nWe don't despise them in Dorne.\nNo? How tolerant of you.\nI expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei,\ngiving up your regal responsibilities.\nWearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.\nI suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn.\nIt's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.\nPlease give him our regards.\nWith any luck, the gout will abate\nwith time and he will be able to walk again.\nThey call it the rich man's disease.\nA wonder you don't have it.\nNoblemen in my part of the country\ndon't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.\nPeople everywhere have their differences.\nIn some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth.\nIn other places the rape and murder of women and children\nis considered distasteful.\nWhat a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent,\nthat your daughter Myrcella has been sent\nto live in the latter sort of place.\nEveryone, silence!

Well fought.\nHere you are.

Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested.\nEddard Stark: Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.\nJory Cassel: Yes, my Lord.\nKing s Landing Guard: If you'd like to change into something more appropriate \n\nNed Stark gives the guard a blank stare before taking off his gloves, the guard realizes Ned s disinterest and the two begin walking to the council chamber. First they walk through the Great Hall, where the throne sits. Jaime Lannister is lingering in front of the throne.\n\nJaime Lannister: Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.\nEddard Stark: Glad to see you're protecting the throne.\nJaime Lannister: Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.\nEddard Stark:  Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.\nJaime Lannister: I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.\nEddard Stark: You've chosen your opponents wisely then.\nJaime Lannister: I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.\nEddard Stark:  But you just stood there and watched.\nJaime Lannister: 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.\nEddard Stark: Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?\nJaime Lannister: Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?\nEddard Stark:  You served him well, when serving was safe.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nNed enters the small council s chamber where the others are already awaiting him.\n\nVarys: Lord Stark.\nEddard Stark: Lord Varys.\nVarys: I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.\nEddard Stark:  A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.\nRenly Baratheon: And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...\nPetyr Baelish: But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.\nEddard Stark:  She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.\nPetyr Baelish: All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.\nEddard Stark: Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.\nPetyr Baelish: It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.\nEddard Stark:  Grand Maester.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: How many years has it been? You were a young man.\nEddard Stark: And you served another King.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?\nEddard Stark:  Without the King?\nRenly Baratheon: Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.\nVarys: His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.\nPetyr Baelish:  We are the lords of small matters here.\nRenly Baratheon: My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.\nPetyr Baelish:  Mmm, how much?\nEddard Stark: 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: Can the treasury bear such expense?\nPetyr Baelish:  I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?\nEddard Stark:  Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?\nPetyr Baelish: I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.\nEddard Stark:  How could you let this happen?\nPetyr Baelish:  The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.\nEddard Stark:  I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.\nRenly Baratheon: \"Counting coppers,\" he calls it.\nEddard Stark:  I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.\nPetyr Baelish:  As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.\nEddard Stark:  There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.\nVarys: You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nCersei tending to Joffrey s  wound .\n\nCersei Baratheon: Please, it's nearly healed.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  It's ugly.\nCersei Baratheon: A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.\nCersei Baratheon: That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.\nJoffrey Baratheon: Do I have to marry her?\nCersei Baratheon: Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  I don't want to.\nCersei Baratheon: No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.\nJoffrey Baratheon: We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.\nCersei Baratheon: How would you handle them?\nJoffrey Baratheon:  I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.\nCersei Baratheon:  A royal army?\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.\nCersei Baratheon: And if the northerners rebel?\nJoffrey Baratheon: I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.\nCersei Baratheon: And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?\nJoffrey Baratheon:  For me. I'm their King.\nCersei Baratheon:  But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  I'm not asking.\nCersei Baratheon: The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  So you agree... The Starks are enemies?\nCersei Baratheon:  Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nArya, Sansa and their Septa are all around a table eating. Arya is stabbing a knife into the table between her fingers.\n\nSepta Mordane: Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.\nArya Stark:  I'm practicing.\nSansa Stark:  Practicing for what?\nArya Stark: The Prince.\nSepta Mordane: Arya, stop!\nArya Stark: He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.\nSansa Stark: The Hound killed your friend.\nArya Stark: The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.\nSansa Stark: You're an idiot.\nArya Stark: You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.\nSepta Mordane: Enough!\n\nSepta Mordane begins escorting Arya away from the table as Ned walks in.\n\nEddard Stark:  What's happening here?\nSepta Mordane: Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.\nEddard Stark:  Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love \n\nNed places a wrapped package in front of Sansa on the table.\n\nEddard Stark:  The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?\nSansa Stark: I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?\nSepta Mordane: You've barely eaten a thing.\nEddard Stark:  It's all right. Go on.\n\nSansa gets up from the table, leaving only Ned and Septa Mordane.\n\nEddard Stark: War was easier than daughters.\n\nArya is unsheathing Needle privately in her room as Ned knocks on the door.\n\nArya Stark: Go away!\nEddard Stark: Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?\nArya Stark:  Mine.\nEddard Stark:  Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.\nArya Stark: I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.\nEddard Stark:  Come here. Now what do you want with this?\nArya Stark:  It's called Needle.\nEddard Stark:  A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?\nArya Stark: Stick 'em with the pointy end.\nEddard Stark: [laughs] That's the essence of it.\nArya Stark: I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.\nEddard Stark:  No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.\nArya Stark: I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.\nEddard Stark:  Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.\nArya Stark: So was I! He is a liar.\nEddard Stark: Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.\nArya Stark: But how you can let her marry someone like that?\nEddard Stark: Well  Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.\nArya Stark: Winter is coming.\nEddard Stark: You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.\nArya Stark: I don't hate her. Not really.\nEddard Stark: I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.\nArya Stark: I can keep it?\nEddard Stark:  Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBran s bedside in Winterfell. A crow lands on his windowsill.\n\nOld Nan:  Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.\nBran Stark:  I hate your stories.\nOld Nan:  I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.\nBran Stark: Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.\nOld Nan: Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds \n\nRobb walks into the room, interrupting Old Nan s story.\n\nRobb Stark:  What are you telling him now?\nOld Nan: Only what the little Lord wants to hear.\nRobb Stark:  Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.\nBran Stark:  Maybe we do.\nRobb Stark:  How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.\nBran Stark:  I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.\nRobb Stark: Don't ever say that.\nBran Stark: I'd rather be dead.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nCatelyn and Rodrick arrive at King s Landing, entering through a back entrance.\n\nRodrick Cassel: Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.\nCatelyn Stark:  It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.\nRodrick Cassel: My Lady.\n\nTwo guards pull up to her on horseback and hand her a scroll, informing her that she is to follow them.\n\nGuard: Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?\nCatelyn Stark:  I would. We've done nothing wrong.\nGuard: We've been instructed to escort you into the city.\nCatelyn Stark: Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...\nGuard: Follow me, Lady Stark.\n\nAt Baelish s brothel.\n\nPetyr Baelish:  Cat! Go on. Go upstairs. (to his whores)\nCatelyn Stark:  You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a \n\nTwo naked whores interrupt, Baelish snaps at them to leave.\n\nPetyr Baelish: I meant no disrespect to you of all people.\nCatelyn Stark:  How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?\nPetyr Baelish:  No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.\nCatelyn Stark:  How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?\nPetyr Baelish: A dear friend told me.\nVarys:  Lady Stark.\nCatelyn Stark:  Lord Varys.\nVarys:  To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.\nCatelyn Stark: How did you know I was coming?\nVarys:  Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.\nCatelyn Stark:  Do you know whose dagger this is?\nVarys:  I must admit I do not.\nPetyr Baelish:  Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.\nCatelyn Stark:  Yours?\nPetyr Baelish: At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.\nCatelyn Stark: To whom?\nPetyr Baelish:  Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAt Castle Black, in a courtyard. Grenn and Jon are swordfighting, Jon getting the best of him and breaking his nose.\n\nAlliser Thorne: If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?\n\nPyp steps forward and with one move Jon has him on his back.\n\nAlliser Thorne: Next!\n\nJon quickly dispatches of another newcomer, we see Lord Commander Jeor and Tyrion looking on from a balcony.\n\nAlliser Thorne: Next!\n\nAnother man starts againt Jon Snow, as another joins, Jon defeats the two of them almost instantly.\n\nAlliser Thorne: Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.\n\nTyrion and Lord Commander talking, overlooking the courtyard.\n\nTyrion Lannister: A charming man.\nJeor Mormont: I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.\nTyrion Lannister: And how's that going, Commander Mormont?\nJeor Mormont: Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.\nTyrion Lannister: Good news or bad?\nJeor Mormont: Both.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBack in the throne room, just outside of the small council chambers.\n\nGrand Maester Pycelle: Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.\nPetyr Baelish:  Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?\nEddard Stark:  My wife is in Winterfell.\nPetyr Baelish:  Is she?\n\nBaelish leads Ned to the entrance of his brothel. Ned is not so keen on the idea and begins choking Baelish.\n\nPetyr Baelish:  I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.\nEddard Stark: You're a funny man. A very funny man.\nCatelyn Stark:  Ned! [poking her head out of a window]\nPetyr Baelish: The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nJon is in the armory of Castle Black, putting away equipment when a gang of the guys jump him.\n\nGrenn: You broke my nose, bastard!\nJon Snow:  It's an improvement.\nGrenn: If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.\nPyp: I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.\nGrenn: What're you looking at, halfman?\nTyrion Lannister:  I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.\nRast: What do you care about our faces?\nTyrion Lannister: It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.\nGrenn: We'll talk later, Lord Snow.\nJon Snow: Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.\nTyrion Lannister:  Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice: his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.\nJon Snow: They hate me because I'm better than they are.\nTyrion Lannister: It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAt Baelish s brothel.\n\nPetyr Baelish: The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.\nCatelyn Stark: We have proof. We have the blade.\nPetyr Baelish:  Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.\nCatelyn Stark:  Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.\nPetyr Baelish:  I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.\nCatelyn Stark: I won't forget this. You're a true friend.\nPetyr Baelish:  Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn the Queen s chambers.\n\nCersei Baratheon: How could you be so stupid?\nJaime Lannister: Calm down.\nCersei Baratheon: He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?\nJaime Lannister: I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?\nCersei Baratheon: Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.\nJaime Lannister: Then what are you raving about?\nCersei Baratheon: What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...\nJaime Lannister: We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.\nCersei Baratheon: And my husband?\nJaime Lannister: I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us : \"The War for Cersei's Cunt.\"\n\nCersei hits Jaime, he spins her around and hugs her from behind, whispering into her ear.\n\nCersei Baratheon: Let me go.\nJaime Lannister: Never.\nCersei Baratheon: Let me go.\nJaime Lannister: The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn a back alley before Catelyn leaves King s Landing.\n\nCatelyn Stark:  I wish I could see the girls.\nEddard Stark:  It's too dangerous.\nCatelyn Stark: Just for a moment.\nEddard Stark:  Until we know who our enemies are...\nCatelyn Stark: I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.\nEddard Stark:  Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.\nCersei Baratheon: And if you find the proof?\nEddard Stark: Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.\nCatelyn Stark: My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.\nEddard Stark: He still loves you.\nCatelyn Stark: Does he?\nEddard Stark: Off with you.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn the King s chambers, he s drinking and eating at a table.\n\nRobert Baratheon:  It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?\nBarristan Selmy: Of course, your Grace.\nRobert Baratheon:  Who was it?\nBarristan Selmy: A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.\nRobert Baratheon: How'd you do it?\nBarristan Selmy: Lance through the heart.\nRobert Baratheon: Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, \"Wait! Wait!\"... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?\nLancel Lannister: It's empty, your Grace.\nRobert Baratheon: What do you mean it's empty?\nLancel Lannister: There's no more wine.\nRobert Baratheon:  Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?\nJaime Lannister: One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.\nBarristan Selmy: I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.\nJaime Lannister: You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.\nBarristan Selmy: A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.\nRobert Baratheon: Your outlaw... Any last words?\nJaime Lannister: I cut his head off, so no.\nRobert Baratheon: What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?\nJaime Lannister: He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... \"Burn them all.\" If that's all, your Grace...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nRiding horseback and walking through fields.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen: : Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?\nJorah Mormont:  The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.\nDaenerys Targaryen: From whom?\nJorah Mormont:  If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices : pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.\n\nDaenerys sees one of the Dothraki men strike a slave with a whip for not moving fast enough.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen: Tell them all to stop.\nJorah Mormont: You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Until I command them otherwise.\nJorah Mormont:  You're learning to talk like a Queen.\nDaenerys Targaryen: Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.\n\nDaenerys dismounts her horse and walks through the field off of the path. She hears noises coming towards her and grass snapping. Her brother Viserys storms into the clearing on horseback wielding a sword.\n\nViserys Targaryen: You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?\n\nViserys has his sword to Daenerys  throat. Rakharo whips Viserys, wrapping it around his neck and yanking him to his back.\n\nIrri: Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  No!\nIrri: Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.\nViserys Targaryen: Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!\nJorah Mormont:  Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?\nRakharo: You walk. [to Viserys]\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nJon and Benjen looking out over the wall. Benjen saying goodbye.\n\nBenjen Stark:  I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.\nJon Snow: You're leaving?\nBenjen Stark: I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.\nJon Snow:  What kind of reports?\nBenjen Stark:  The kind I don't want to believe.\nJon Snow: 'm ready. I won't let you down.\nBenjen Stark: You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.\nJon Snow: But I'm better than every...\nBenjen Stark: Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nYoren and Tyrion getting drunk on wine in a the mess hall of Castle Black.\n\nYoren: A bear's balls.\nTyrion Lannister: You're joking?\nYoren: And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.\nTyrion Lannister: And how do a bear's balls taste?\nYoren: A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?\nTyrion Lannister:  Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?\nYoren: But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.\nTyrion Lannister: They have a better chance finding feed than glory.\n\nBenjen enters.\n\nBenjen Stark: The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?\nTyrion Lannister:  You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.\nBenjen Stark:  I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.\nTyrion Lannister: Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?\nBenjen Stark: Call me what you like.\nTyrion Lannister:  I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.\nBenjen Stark: You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word \"but\" really counts.\nTyrion Lannister: But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.\nBenjen Stark:  You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.\nYoren: Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm.\nBenjen Stark:  Enjoy the capital, brother.\nYoren: I always do.\nTyrion Lannister: I think he's starting to like me. \"Going below\"?\nYoren: Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.\nTyrion Lannister: So you're heading down to King's Landing too.\nYoren: Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.\nTyrion Lannister: Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.\nYoren: I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.\nTyrion Lannister:  Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIrri is braiding Daenerys hair and teaching her Dothraki. She feels Daenerys  breast.\n\nIrri: Yes, Khaleesi.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  What are you doing?\nIrri: When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It s a blessing from the Great Stallion.\n\nJorah and Rakharo around a fire in a tent.\n\nJorah Mormont:  For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.\nRakharo: Dothraki don t wear steel dresses.\nJorah Mormont: Armor.\nRakharo: Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?\nJorah Mormont:  Slow.\nRakharo: Slow.\nJorah Mormont: It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.\nRakharo: My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.\nJorah Mormont:  I ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.\nRakharo: He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?\nJorah Mormont: He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.\nIrri: The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.\nRakharo: There are no rabbits.\nIrri: Find some ducks, she likes ducks.\nRakharo: Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?\nIrri: Dog then. I have seen many dogs.\nJorah Mormont: I don't think she wants to eat dog.\nIrri: The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.\nRakharo: A blessing from the Great Stallion.\nIrri: She does not want to eat horse.\nJorah Mormont: I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.\nRhakaro: We ride for Vaes Dothrak.\nJorah Mormont: Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBack again in the courtyard of Castle Black. Jon is battling his brothers in black as Tyrion overlooks from the balcony. Jon continuing to defeat them, he begins teaching them.\n\nJon Snow: Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.\n\nTyrion reenters the hall to speak and drink with Aemon and Lord Commander.\n\nMaester Aemon: How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?\nTyrion Lannister:  Eight... no, nine.\nMaester Aemon: All of them brief?\nTyrion Lannister:  They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.\nMaester Aemon: This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually : winter is coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it.\nJeor Mormont: We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.\nTyrion Lannister:  Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.\nJeor Mormont: One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.\nMaester Aemon: The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.\nJeor Mormont: Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.\nMaester Aemon: When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThe Khal and Daenerys are intertwined in their tent via candlelight.

And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.\nJon Snow:  Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?\nTyrion Lannister:  I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.\nJon Snow:  If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.\nTyrion Lannister: Of course.\nJon Snow: He'll never walk again.\nTyrion Lannister: If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.\nJon Snow: Farewell, My Lord.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nArya arrives to her  dance lesson  in King s Landing.\n\nSyrio Forel:  You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.\nArya Stark:  Who are you?\nSyrio Forel: Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.\n\nSyrio throws a wooden sword to Arya, she does not catch it, but drops it.\n\nSyrio Forel: Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.\nArya Stark:  It's too heavy.\nSyrio Forel:  It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.\nArya Stark: What if I drop it?\nSyrio Forel: The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.\nArya Stark: I'm a girl.\nSyrio Forel:  Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...\nArya Stark:  A needle.\nSyrio Forel: Ahhh  Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me.\n\nArya takes several attempts as Syrio turns his back, defending her and disarming her constantly. She begins picking up on a few things, but still needs much work. Ned enters in the doorway and his smile turns to a grimace watching his daughter swordfight.\n\nSyrio Forel: Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.\n\n", "episode_2": "\n\nDaenerys on horseback looking at Drogo and his people.\n\nJorah Mormont: You need to drink, child... And eat.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen: Isn't there anything else?\n\nJorah Mormont: The Dothraki have two things in abundance: grass and horses. People can't live on grass... In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night. It murders all other grass. The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything. That's the way the world will end  It'll get easier.\n\nArriving at camp, Daenerys looks exhausted from riding.\n\nDoreah: Khaleesi!\nIrri: Your hands.\n\nAfter Daenerys is escorted away, Jorah and Viserys are alone.\n\nJorah Mormont: We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there.\nViserys Targaryen: I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.\nJorah Mormont: As you wish, your Grace.\nViserys Targaryen: Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?\nJorah Mormont: Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.\nViserys Targaryen: Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense.

We ride for King's Landing today.\nTyrion Lannister: Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.\nJoffrey Baratheon: What good will my sympathies do them?\nTyrion Lannister: None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.\nJoffrey Baratheon: The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.\nTyrion Lannister: One word and I'll hit you again.\nJoffrey Baratheon: I'm telling mother!\nTyrion Lannister: Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?\nJoffrey Baratheon: You can't...\nTyrion Lannister: Do you understand?\nSandor Clegane: The Prince will remember that, little lord.\nTyrion Lannister: I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast...\n\nTyrion walks from the courtyard to the dining hall where his family is eating breakfast.\n\nTyrion Lannister: Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black.\nJaime Lannister: Little brother.\nTyrion Lannister: Beloved siblings.\nMyrcella Baratheon: Is Bran going to die?\nTyrion Lannister: Apparently not.\nCersei Baratheon: What do you mean?\nTyrion Lannister: The Maester says the boy may live.\nCersei Baratheon: It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.\nTyrion Lannister: Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.\nCersei Baratheon: I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.\nTyrion Lannister: Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.\nJaime Lannister: Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.\nTyrion Lannister: And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.\nCersei Baratheon: The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.\nJaime Lannister: Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.\nTyrion Lannister: Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.\nJaime Lannister: My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.\nTyrion Lannister: My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn Bran s room with Catelyn at his bedside, Cersei coming to console.\n\nCersei Baratheon: Please.\nCatelyn Stark:  I would have dressed, your Grace.\nCersei Baratheon: This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.\nCatelyn Stark: I never knew.\nCersei Baratheon:  It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.\nCatelyn Stark:  I am grateful..\nCersei Baratheon: Perhaps this time she'll listen.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nNear the Smith in a courtyard of Winterfell.\n\nJaime Lannister: A sword for the wall?\nJon Snow: I already have one.\nJaime Lannister: Good man. Have you swung it yet?\nJon Snow: Of course I have.\nJaime Lannister:  At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.\nJon Snow: We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.\nJaime Lannister: Is it \"we\" already? Have you taken your vows then?\nJon Snow: Soon enough.\nJaime Lannister: Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nArya s room, packing things for her trip to King s Landing, having her direwolf assist her. Jon comes in to say goodbye before he leaves for the Night's Watch.\n\nArya Stark: Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. \"My things weren't properly folded\", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.\nJon Snow: It's good you've got help.\nArya Stark: Watch. Nymeria, gloves.\nJon Snow:  Impressive.\nArya Stark:  Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!\nJon Snow:  I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.\nArya Stark:  A present?\nJon Snow:  Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.\nArya Stark:  It's so skinny.\nJon Snow: So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.\nArya Stark: I can be quick.\nJon Snow:  You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?\nArya Stark: I think so.\nJon Snow: First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.\nArya Stark:  I know which end to use.\nJon Snow:  I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know.\nArya Stark:  Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nJon walks into Bran s room, where Catelyn is still at his bedside.\n\nJon Snow:  I came to say goodbye to Bran.\nCatelyn Stark:  You've said it.\nJon Snow:  I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.\nCatelyn Stark: I want you to leave.\n\nEddard walks into the room, Jon kisses Brandon on the forehead and exits.\n\nCatelyn Stark: 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.\nEddard Stark:  I have no choice.\nCatelyn Stark: That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't.\nEddard Stark:  You can. You must.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn the courtyard, Jon prepping his horse to leave for the Wall.\n\nRobb Stark: You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.\nJon Snow:  You Starks are hard to kill.\nRobb Stark: My mother?\nJon Snow:  She was very kind.\nRobb Stark: Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.\nJon Snow:  It was always my color.\nRobb Stark: Farewell, Snow.\nJon Snow:  And you, Stark.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAt the split between the Kingsroad and the road that will take Benjen and Jon to the Wall.\n\nEddard Stark: There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.\nJon Snow: Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?\nEddard Stark: The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nStopping for rest along the Kingsroad. Robert has a mini table set up full of wine and food.\n\nRobert Baratheon: Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.\nEddard Stark:  I've half a mind to go with you.\nRobert Baratheon: What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.\nEddard Stark: You should have asked me 20 years ago.\nRobert Baratheon: There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.\nEddard Stark:  I recall a few chances.\nRobert Baratheon: There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.\nEddard Stark:  Bessie. She was one of yours.\nRobert Baratheon: Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?\nEddard Stark:  Wylla.\nRobert Baratheon: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.\nEddard Stark:  Nor will I.\nRobert Baratheon: We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.\nEddard Stark: The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.\nRobert Baratheon: Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.\nEddard Stark:  Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?\nRobert Baratheon: A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.\nEddard Stark: She's little more than a child.\nRobert Baratheon: Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.\nEddard Stark:  Tell me we're not speaking of this.\nRobert Baratheon: Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.\nEddard Stark:  But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?\nRobert Baratheon:  This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.\nEddard Stark: Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.\nRobert Baratheon:  There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.\nEddard Stark: He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.\nRobert Baratheon: There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nBack across the sea, Drogo fornicates with Daenerys, she s clearly not enjoying it.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nOn their way to the Wall, stopping to set up camp for the night.\n\nBenjen Stark: Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.\nTyrion Lannister: Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.\nJon Snow: Why do you read so much?\nTyrion Lannister: Look at me and tell me what you see.\nJon Snow:  Is this a trick?\nTyrion Lannister:  What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.\nJon Snow: Until your brother killed that King.\nTyrion Lannister: Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?\nJon Snow: Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.\nTyrion Lannister:  A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.\nJon Snow: The Night's Watch protects the realm from...\nTyrion Lannister: Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nBran s bedroom, Catelyn still at his bedside, Maester Luwin walks in.\n\nMaester Luwin: It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.\nCatelyn Stark:  Talk to Poole about it.\nMaester Luwin: Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention...\nCatelyn Stark: I don't care about appointments!\nRobb Stark:  I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.\nMaester Luwin: Very good, my Lord. My Lady.\nRobb Stark:  When was the last time you left this room?\nCatelyn Stark:  I have to take care of him.\nRobb Stark: He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.\nCatelyn Stark: What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.\nRobb Stark: Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...\nCatelyn Stark: Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop! (Wolf s howling repeatedly)\nRobb Stark:  Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.\n\nAssassin: You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.\nCatelyn Stark:  No!\n\nThe man is an assassin, when he draws his blade, Catelyn begins to fend him off. In the process her hands are both sliced. The man walks within inches of Bran and his direwolf comes in and mauls the assassin.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nIn Daenerys  tent across the Narrow Sea.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Have you ever seen a dragon?\nIrri: Dragon gone, Khaleesi.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Everywhere? Even in the east?\nIrri: No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.\nJhiqui: It is known.\nDoreah: A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.\nDaenerys Targaryen: The moon?\nDoreah: He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.\nIrri: Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.\nJhiqui: It is known.\nDaenerys Targaryen: Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?\n\nIrri leaves the tent.\n\nDoreah: Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.\nDaenerys Targaryen: How old were you?\nDoreah: I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Nine?!\nDoreah: I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?\nDoreah: Yes.\nDaenerys Targaryen: Will it take three years?\nDoreah: No.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nJon, Tyrion, Benjen and company arrive at the wall and look at it from afar.\n\nBenjen Stark: Welcome.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nCatelyn is on the ground where Bran s body was discovered, below the tower he fell from. She looks up and sees the window. She now is looking through that same window where Bran fell. She investigates the room, noticing a cleared patch on some flooring, finding a long blonde hair.\n\nCatelyn holds council in the Godswood with Robb, Theon Greyjoy, Rodrick and Maester Luwin.\n\nCatelyn Stark:  What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.\nMaester Luwin: The boy was always sure-footed before.\nCatelyn Stark: Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.\nTheon Greyjoy: Saw what, my lady?\nCatelyn Stark: I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.\nRodrick Cassel: Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.\nRobb Stark:  They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...\nTheon Greyjoy: If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.\nMaester Luwin: What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.\nCatelyn Stark:  I don't trust a raven to carry these words.\nRobb Stark:  I'll ride to King's Landing.\nCatelyn Stark:  No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.\nRobb Stark:  Mother, you can't.\nCatelyn Stark: I must.\nRodrick Cassel: I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.\nCatelyn Stark:  Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.\nRodrick Cassel: Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.\nRobb Stark:  What about Bran?\nCatelyn Stark:  I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nBack at Daenerys  tent, Doreah is on top of her,  teaching  Daenerys how to please Khal Drogo.\n\nDoreah: No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.\nDaenerys Targaryen: Finish a man?\nDoreah: Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.\nDoreah: You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.\nDoreah: If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?\nDaenerys Targaryen:  No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nThe Lannisters, traveling Starks and all royal guards have stopped for the evening to rest on their way to King s Landing.\n\nSansa Stark:  Pardon me, Ser.\nSandor Clegane: Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face.\nSansa Stark:  I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?\nSandor Clegane: He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.\nJoffrey Baratheon: He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.\nSansa Stark: Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.\n\nIn a field next to a river, off from where everyone else is.\n\nMycah: I'll get you!\nSansa Stark:  Arya!\nArya Stark: What are you doing here? Go away.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Your sister? And who are you, boy?\nMycah: Mycah, my Lord.\nSansa Stark: He the butcher's boy.\nArya Stark: He's my friend.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.\nMycah: She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.\nMycah: It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.\nJoffrey Baratheon: And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?\nArya Stark: Stop it!\nSansa Stark:  Arya, stay out of this.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!\nSansa Stark:  No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!\nJoffrey Baratheon:  I'll gut you, you little cunt!\nSansa Stark: Arya!\n\nArya then steps in and fights with Joffrey, disarming him and putting him on his back. Her direwolf sees this as a thread and runs in to defend.\n\nArya Stark:  Nymeria!\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Please don't.\nSansa Stark:  Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.\nJoffrey Baratheon: Then go! Don't touch me.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nA hunt has begun for the direwolf that attacked Joffrey.\n\nSoldier 1: The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.\n\nArya hidden from everyone telling her direwolf to leave.\n\nArya Stark:  You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!\n\nSoldier 2: It's a direwolf.\nSoldier 1: I'll check down here.\nSoldier 2: I think I heard a noise.\n\nArya Stark:  Go!\n\nJory comes to tell Ned that his daughter has been found.\n\nJory Cassel: My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.\nEddard Stark: Where is she?\nJory Cassel: She's been taken directly before the King.\nEddard Stark: Who took her?\nJory Cassel: The Lannisters found her.\nEddard Stark: Right, get back.\nJory Cassel: The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.\nEddard Stark: Back! Back to the inn. All back!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nNow back at the Inn where everyone is staying.\n\nArya Stark:  I'm sorry.\nEddard Stark: Are you hurt?\nArya Stark: No.\nEddard Stark: It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?\nCersei Baratheon:  How dare you speak to your King in that manner?\nRobert Baratheon: Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.\nCersei Baratheon: Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.\nArya Stark:  That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.\nCersei Baratheon: Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.\nArya Stark:  That's not what happened!\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.\nArya Stark:  Liar!\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Shut up!\nRobert Baratheon: Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?\nEddard Stark: In bed asleep.\nCersei Baratheon: She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.\nRobert Baratheon: Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King.\nSansa Stark: I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.\nArya Stark: Liar! Liar liar liar!\nSansa Stark: Arya!\nEddard Stark: Stop it! That's enough of that.\nArya Stark:  Liar liar liar!\nEddard Stark: Stop! Arya!\nCersei Baratheon:  She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.\nRobert Baratheon: What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over.\nCersei Baratheon:  Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.\nRobert Baratheon: You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.\nEddard Stark: Gladly, your Grace.\nCersei Baratheon:  And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?\nRobert Baratheon: I'd forgot the damned wolf.\nSoldier: We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.\nRobert Baratheon: So be it.\nCersei Baratheon: We have another wolf.\nRobert Baratheon:  As you will.\nEddard Stark: You can't mean it.\nRobert Baratheon: A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.\nSansa Stark: He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!\nArya Stark: Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!\nSansa Stark:  Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!\nEddard Stark: s this your command... your Grace?\nCersei Baratheon:  Where is the beast?\nSoldier: Chained up outside, your Grace.\nCersei Baratheon: Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.\nEddard Stark: No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.\nCersei Baratheon: Is this some trick?\nEddard Stark:  The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.\n\nOnce outside, before Eddard lays to rest the direwolf.\n\nEddard Stark: The butcher's boy... You rode him down?\nSandor Clegane: He ran... Not very fast.\n\nEddard kills the direwolf on the King s orders.\n\n", "episode_1": "\n\n[First scene opens with three Rangers riding through a tunnel, leaving the Wall, and going into the woods.

Get back on your horse. I won t say it again.\n\n[WILL glares, but obeys. Sometime later, the three Rangers return to the campsite, which is now completely cleared.]\n\nROYCE: Your dead men seem to have moved camp.\n\nWILL: They were here.\n\nGARED: See where they went.\n\n[The three look around, swords drawn. They hear the wind and eerie calls. GARED finds a red cloth in the snow.]\n\nROYCE: What is it?\n\nGARED: It s  \n\n[As he speaks, a CREATURE with glowing blue eyes rises behind ROYCE. ROYCE turns, the CREATURE strikes. The scene shifts to WILL, who hears a man crying out. The three horses stampede past him. He turns and sees someone standing very still in the distance. The figure turns   it s the child who had been suspended in the tree, now with glowing blue eyes. WILL turns and runs.\nGARED is also fleeing, and we hear strange growls and catch glimpses of the CREATURE. Both terrified RANGERS stop, some distance apart, to catch their breath. WILL sees a CREATURE behead GARED. WILL sinks to his knees and the CREATURE tosses GARED S head to him.]\n\n[Blackout / Opening credits]\n\n[Riders from Winterfell come up behind a dazed WILL. The scene shifts to the castle, where BRAN is practicing archery and getting frustrated, under the eyes of JON SNOW and ROBB STARK. JON pats BRAN S shoulder.]\n\nJON: Go on. Father s watching.\n\n[We see NED and CATELYN STARK watching from above.]\n\nJON: And your mother.\n\n[Scene shifts to needlework practice with the girls inside the castle.]\n\nSEPTA MORDANE (to SANSA): Fine work, as always. Well done.\n\nSANSA: Thank you.\n\nSEPTA MORDANE: I love the detail that you ve managed to get in this corners.   Quite beautiful   the stitching  \n\n[As she murmurs to SANSA about the embroidery, ARYA struggles with her needlework and listens to the arrows hitting and the male laughter outside.]\n[Outside, BRAN tries and misses again. Everyone laughs.]\n\nNED: And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.\n\nJON: Don t think too much, Bran.\n\nROBB: Relax your bow arm.\n\n[BRAN pulls the arrow back. An arrow hits the bullseye. BRAN (still with his arrow), JON, and ROBB turn in surprise to see ARYA, who curtsies after her perfect shot. ROBB and JON laugh as Bran takes out after ARYA.]\n\nJON/ROBB: Quick, Bran, faster!\n\n[RODRICK CASSEL and THEON GREYJOY approach NED and CATELYN on the balcony.]\n\nCASSEL: Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They ve captured a deserter from the Night s Watch.\n\n[NED grimaces.]\n\nNED: Get the lads to saddle their horses.\n\n[THEON departs.]\n\nCATELYN: Do you have to?\n\nNED: He swore an oath, Cat.\n\nCASSEL: The law is law, my lady.\n\nNED: Tell Bran he s coming, too.\n\n[CASSEL nods and departs.]\n\nCATELYN: Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.\n\nNED: He won t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.\n\n[NED departs. In the courtyard, ROBB and JON gather the arrows. CATELYN turns and glares down on JON. He looks at her and walks away.]\n\nROBB: Lad, go run back and get the rest.\n\n[Scene shifts, and we see WILL being taken to the block.]\n\nWILL (muttering): White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.\n\n[He and NED face each other.]\n\nWILL: I know I broke my oath. And I know I m a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I m no coward. Tell them I m sorry.\n\nNED nods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block. [NED draws Ice from a scabbard held by Theon.]\n\nWILL (whispering): Forgive me, lord.\n\n[NED bows his head over ICE.]\n\nNED: In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name  \n\nJON (to BRAN): Don t look away.\n\nNED: King of the Andals and the First Men  \n\nJON: Father will know if you do.\n\nNED: Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.\n\n[NED swings ICE and beheads WILL. BRAN does not look away.]\n\nJON: You did well.\n\n[He walks away. ROBB turns and puts his arm around BRAN and they go to their horses together. NED approaches BRAN.]\n\nNED: You understand why I did it?\n\nBRAN: Jon said he was a deserter.\n\nNED: But do you understand why I had to kill him?\n\nBRAN: Our way is the old way?\n\nNED: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.\n\nBRAN: Is it true he saw the White Walkers?\n\nNED: The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.\n\nBRAN: So he was lying?\n\nNED: A madman sees what he sees.\n\n[Scene shifts to a dead stag s head. The Winterfell men gather on the bridge They see a ravaged deer before them.]\n\nJON: What is it?\n\nTHEON: Mountain lion?\n\nNED: There are no mountain lions in these woods.\n\n[With swords out, they begin to search. NED finds a dead direwolf with antlers through her throat. Her pups are whimpering around her.]\n\nTHEON: It s a freak.\n\nNED: It s a direwolf.\n\n[NED and CASSEL glance at each other.]\n\nNED: Tough old beast.\n\n[He pulls out the antlers.]\n\nROBB: There are no direwolves south of the Wall.\n\nJON: Now there are five.\n\n[Jon picks up a pup and offers it to BRAN.]\n\nJON: You want to hold it?\n\nBRAN: Where will they go? Their mother s dead.\n\nCASSEL: They don t belong down here.\n\nNED: Better a quick death. They won t last without their mother.\n\nTHEON: Right. Give it here.\n\nBRAN: NO!\n\nROBB (disgustedly to THEON): Put away your blade.\n\nTHEON: I take orders from your father, not you.\n\nBRAN: Please, father!\n\nNED: I m sorry, Bran.\n\nJON: Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.\n\n[Everyone looks at NED, BRAN with great hope.]\n\nNED: You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.\n\n[BRAN cradles his pup as JON hands more pups to ROBB.]\n\nBRAN (to JON): What about you?\n\nJON: I m not a Stark. Get on.\n\n[JON walks away, pauses, and hears another whimper.]\n\nROBB: What is it?\n\n[JON pulls up a white wolf pup.]\n\nTHEON: The runt of the litter. That one s yours, Snow.\n\n[Scene shifts to bells ringing at Kings Landing. In front of the Iron Throne, surrounded by druidical looking celebrants, lies the body of JON ARRYN. Up in the balcony, CERSEI watches the scene below as JAIME approaches.]\n\nJAIME: As your brother, I feel it s my duty to warn you: You worry too much. It s starting to show.\n\nCERSEI: And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.\n\nJAIME: There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We re Lannisters. Lannisters don t act like fools.\n\nCERSEI: What if Jon Arryn told someone?\n\nJAIME: But who would he tell?\n\nCERSEI: My husband.\n\nJAIME: If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.\n\nCERSEI: You should be the Hand of the king.\n\nJAIME: That s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.\n\nScene shifts to a raven approaching Winterfell. [CATELYN crosses a busy courtyard and finds NED in the godswood.]\n\nCATELYN: All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.\n\nNED: You have five northern children. You re not an outsider.\n\nCATELYN: I wonder if the old gods agree.\n\nNED: It s your gods with all the rules.\n\nCATELYN: I am so sorry, my love.\n\nNED: Tell me.\n\nCATELYN: There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.\n\nNED: Your sister. The boy  \n\nCATELYN: They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.\n\nNED: He s coming this far North, there s only one thing he s after.\n\nCATELYN: You can always say no, Ned.\n\n[Scene shifts to the Winterfell great hall where a great banquet is being prepared.]\n\nCATELYN: We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion s chamber. I m told he reads all night.\n\nMAESTER LUWIN: I m told he drinks all night.\n\nCATELYN: How much could he possibly drink? A man of his   stature.\n\nLUWIN: We ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we ll find out.\n\nCATELYN: In any case, candles.\n\n[Scene shifts to Robb, Theon, and Jon getting barbered.]\n\nJON: Why s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?\n\nTHEON: It s for the queen, I bet. I hear she s [sleek as a mink?]\n\nROBB: I hear the prince is a right royal prick.\n\nTHEON: Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.\n\nROBB: Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.\n\n[Scene shifts to the royal procession approaching Winterfell. Bran sees them from his perch high atop a castle wall and clambers nimbly down to tell everyone. CATELYN and LUWIN walk to the courtyard, passing BRAN s wolf pup.]\n\nCATELYN: Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!\n\nBRAN: I saw the king! He s got hundreds of people!\n\nCATELYN: How many times have I told you: No climbing!\n\nBRAN: But he s coming right now! Down our road!\n\nCATELYN: I want you to promise me: No more climbing.\n\nBRAN (looking down): I promise.\n\nCATELYN: D you know what?\n\nBRAN: What?\n\nCATELYN: You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.\n\n[BRAN runs off, followed by his wolf pup.]\n\n[Scene shifts to grand entry of the king s horses and men. ARYA, wearing a helm and cloak, pushes her way into a tall wagon for a better look. In rides JOFFREY, followed by the HOUND. The other Starks wait in a greeting line.]\n\nCATELYN: Where s Arya? Sansa, where s your sister?\n\n[More riders with banners. ARYA scoots past her parents to get in the receiving line.]\n\nNED: Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA s helm]\n\nARYA (pushing BRAN): Move!\n\n[JOFFREY rides up, SANSA smiles at him, ROBB glares at JOFFREY. The HOUND pulls up his helm. The coach carrying CERSEI lumbers in, followed by KING ROBERT. All kneel. ROBERT heaves himself off his horse. NED looks shocked at the sight of his old friend, now fat and red-faced. ROBERT signals for all to rise and looks at NED.]\n\nNED: Your Grace.\n\nROBERT: You ve got fat.\n\n[NED gives ROBERT a  What about you?  look. They start laughing.]\n\nROBERT: Cat!\n\nCATELYN: Your Grace.\n\nROBERT: Nine years. Why haven t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?\n\nNED: Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.\n\n[CERSEI and her other children descend from the coach.]\n\nARYA: Where s the Imp?\n\nSANSA: Will you shut up?\n\nROBERT: Who have we here? You must be Robb. (To Sansa) My, you re a pretty one. (To Arya) Your name is?\n\nARYA: Arya.\n\nROBERT (to BRAN) Ooh. Show us your muscles. You ll be a soldier.\n\n[JAIME removes his helm.]\n\nARYA: That s Jaime Lannister. The queen s twin brother.\n\nSANSA: Would you please shut up.\n\n[CERSEI approaches.]\n\nNED: My queen.\n\nCATELYN: My queen.\n\nROBERT: Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.\n\nCERSEI: We ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.\n\nROBERT: Ned.\n\nARYA: Where s the Imp?\n\n[CERSEI, humiliated in front of all, walks back to JAIME.]\n\nCERSEI: Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.\n\n[Scene changes to the crypt.]\n\nNED: Tell me about Jon Arryn.\n\nROBERT: One minute he was fine, and then   Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.\n\nNED: We both did.\n\nROBERT: He never had to teach you much, but me   You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.\n\nNED: Aye.\n\nROBERT: Don t look at me like that. Not his fault I didn t listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you re no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.\n\n[NED kneels.]\n\nNED: I m not worthy of the honor.\n\nROBERT: I m not trying to honor you. I m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it s not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We ll join our Houses.\n\n[Scene changes to JAIME in the Winterfell settlement. We see Tyrion inside a whorehouse, swilling liquor and laughing as a woman pops into view after servicing him.]\n\nTYRION: Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.\n\nROS: Did you hear the king s in Winterfell?\n\nTYRION: I did hear something about that.\n\nROS: And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nTYRION: And the other brother?\n\nROS: The queen has two brothers?\n\nTYRION: There s the pretty one. And there s the clever one.\n\nROS: I hear they call him the Imp.\n\nTYRION: I hear he hates that nickname.\n\nROS: Oh? I hear he s more than earned it. I hear he s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.\n\nTYRION: Clever girl.\n\nROS: We ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.\n\nTYRION: Have you?\n\nTYRION: The gods gave me one blessing.\n\n[She climbs on TYRION. JAIME walks in without knocking.]\n\nJAIME: Don t get up.\n\nROS: M lord.\n\nTYRION: Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?\n\nJAIME: You ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.\n\nTYRION: She has odd cravings, our sister.\n\nJAIME: A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don t leave me alone with these people.\n\nTYRION: I m sorry, I ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.\n\nJAIME: I thought you might say that. But since we re short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown.\n\n[JAIME leaves.]\n\nTYRION: Close the door!\n\n[Scene changes to the Winterfell crypt, at Lyanna s tomb. Robert places a feather in the hand of her statue.]\n\nROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.\n\nNED: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.\n\nROBERT: She belonged with me.\n\n[He touches Lyanna s face.]\n\nROBERT: In my dreams, I kill him every night.\n\nNED: It s done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.\n\nROBERT: Not all of them.\n\n[Scene shifts to Daenerys on a balcony in Pentos, across the Narrow Sea.]\n\nVISERYS (off camera): Daenerys!\n\n[He enters a large chamber.]\n\nVISERYS: Daenerys! There s our bride to be! Look   a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn t he a gracious host?\n\nDAENERYS: We ve been his guests for over a year and he s never asked us for anything.\n\nVISERYS: Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won t forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a woman s body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don t want to wake the dragon, do you?\n\nDAENERYS: No.\n\n[VISERYS nods and starts to leave the chamber. He turns.]\n\nVISERYS: When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.\n\n[Daenerys turns and steps into a steaming hot bath with a despairing look on her face.]\n\nMAID: It s too hot, my lady.\n\n[But DAENERYS keeps stepping deeper. The scene shifts to ILLYRIOS, DAENERYS, AND VISERYS outside the mansion, awaiting Khal Drogo.]\n\nVISERYS: Where is he?\n\nILLYRIO: The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.\n\n[A host of Dothraki come riding up. Khal Drogo wheels his stallion into the front.]\n\nILLYRIO: (Greets them in Dothraki.) May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.\n\nVISERYS (to DAENERYS) Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He s a savage, of course, but he s one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.\n\nILLYRIO: Come forward, my dear.\n\n[KHAL DROGO watches as DAENERYS walks toward him. She does not hesitate and looks straight at him, although there is fear on her face. KHAL DROGO gazes at her and then leads his horsemen on a charge away.]\n\nVISERYS: Where s he going?\n\nILLYRIO: The ceremony is over.\n\nVISERYS: But he didn t say anything. Did he like her?\n\nILLYRIO: Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn t like her, we d know.\n\n[The scene shifts to ILLYRIO, VISERYS, AND DAENERYS ON A GARDEN BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE SEA.]\n\nILLYRIO: It won t be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father s throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.\n\nVISERYS: When will they be married?\n\nILLYRIO: Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.\n\nVISERYS: Is it true they lie with their horses?\n\nILLYRIO: I wouldn t ask Khal Drogo.\n\nVISERYS: Do you take me for a fool?\n\nILLYRIO: I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I ve given offense.\n\nVISERYS: I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.\n\nDAENERYS (pleadingly) I don t want to be his queen. I want to go home.\n\nVISERYS: So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?\n\nDAENERYS: I don t know.\n\nVISERYS: We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo s army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that s what it took.\n\n[He gives DAENERYS a brotherly kiss on the forehead and walks away. The scene shifts to a bedroom in Winterfell, where CATELYN is fixing SANSA S hair.]\n\nSANSA: Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I m ugly?\n\nCATELYN: Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.\n\nSANSA: He s so handsome.\n\n[CATELYN rolls her eyes.]\n\nSANSA: When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?\n\nCATELYN: Hush now. Your father hasn t even said yes.\n\nSANSA: Why would he say no? He d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.\n\nCATELYN: He d have to leave home. He d have to leave me. And so would you.\n\nSANSA: You left your home to come here. And I d be queen someday. Please make father say yes.\n\nCATELYN: Sansa \n\nSANSA: Please, please. It s the only thing I ever wanted.\n\n[Scene shifts to the Winterfell banquet. Laughter, music, KING ROBERT getting bawdy with a wench. CATELYN and CERSEI watch, CATELYN embarrassed for CERSEI, who looks disgusted. Out in the courtyard, JON takes out his frustration on a fencing dummy. His uncle BENJEN rides up.]\n\nBENJEN: Is he dead yet?\n\nJON: Uncle Benjen!\n\n[They hug.]\n\nBENJEN: You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren t you at the feast?\n\nJON: Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.\n\nBENJEN: Well, you re always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.\n\nJON: So take me with you when you go back.\n\nBENJEN: Jon \n\nJON: Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.\n\nBENJEN: The Wall isn t going anywhere.\n\nJON: I m ready to swear your oath.\n\nBENJEN: You don t understand what you d be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.\n\nJON: I don t care about that.\n\nBENJEN: You might, if you knew what it meant.   I d better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We ll talk later.\n\n[BENJEN goes to the banquet.]\n\nTYRION: Your uncle s in the Night s Watch.\n\nJON: What re you doing back there?\n\nTYRION (drinking): Preparing for a night with your family. I ve always wanted to see the Wall.\n\nJON: You re Tyrion Lannister. The queen s brother?\n\nTYRION: My greatest accomplishment. You   you re Ned Stark s bastard, aren t you?\n\n[JON looks angry and turns away.]\n\nTYRION: Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.\n\nJON: Lord Eddard Stark is my father.\n\nTYRION: And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.\n\nJON: What the hell do you know about being a bastard?\n\nTYRION: All dwarves are bastards in their fathers  eyes.\n\n[TYRION departs. JON picks up his sword and attacks the dummy with new ferocity.]\n\n[The scene shifts back to the banquet, in full raucous swing. NED is off to himself; BENJEN comes up to him.]\n\nBENJEN: You at a feast -- It s like a bear in a trap.\n\nNED: The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?\n\nBENJEN: Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.\n\nNED: He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.\n\nBENJEN: The two he was with are still missing.\n\nNED: A wildling ambush.\n\nBENJEN: Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.\n\nNED: Winter is coming.\n\n[ROBB approaches.]\n\nROBB: Uncle Benjen.\n\nBENJEN: Robb boy. How are ye?\n\nROBB: I m good.\n\n[KING ROBERT gets even more bawdy with a wench.]\n\nCATELYN (in desperation) Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?\n\nCERSEI: Yes. Lovely country.\n\n[They observe SANSA.]\n\nCATELYN: I m sure it s very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.\n\n[SANSA approaches and smiles shyly at CERSEI.]\n\nCERSEI: Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?\n\nSANSA: Thirteen, Your Grace.\n\nCERSEI: You re tall. Still growing?\n\nSANSA: I think so, Your Grace.\n\nCERSEI: And have you bled yet?\n\nSANSA (discomfited): No, Your Grace.\n\nCERSEI: And your dress. Did you make it?\n\n[SANSA nods yes.]\n\nCERSEI: Such talent. You must make something for me.\n\n[SANSA departs.]\n\nCERSEI (to CATELYN]: I hear we might share a grandchild someday.\n\nCATELYN: I hear the same.\n\nCERSEI: Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn t stay hidden up here forever.\n\n[SANSA and JOFFREY catch each other s eye. JOFFREY smiles at her and she turns to her friend.]\n\n[JAIME and NED meet up. JAIME blocks their path.]\n\nNED: Your pardon.\n\nJAIME: I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it s true.\n\nNED: Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.\n\nJAIME: I m sure we ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.\n\nNED: I don t fight in tournaments.\n\nJAIME: No? Getting a little old for it?\n\nNED: I don t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don t want him to know what I can do.\n\nJAIME: Well said.\n\n[ARYA flips food onto SANSA s face.]\n\nSANSA: Arya!\n\n[CATELYN signals a laughing ROBB to deal with the girls. He hoists up ARYA.]\n\nROBB: Time for bed.\n\n[The scene shifts to after the banquet. NED and CATELYN are in their bed.]\n\nNED: I m a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat s nest they call a capital.\n\nCATELYN: I won t let him take you.\n\nNED: The king takes what he wants. That s why he s king.\n\nCATELYN: I ll say,  Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now. \n\nNED: How did he get so fat?\n\nCATELYN: He only stops eating when it s time for a drink.\n\n[There s a knock at the door.]\n\nA VOICE: It s Maester Luwin, my lord.\n\nNED: Send him in.\n\nLUWIN: Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.\n\n[He hands CATELYN a sealed note.]\n\nNED: Stay.\n\nCATELYN: This was sent from the Eyrie. What s she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn t been back there since her wedding.\n\n[CATELYN reads the note, looks up in alarm, and then burns it.]\n\nNED: What news?\n\nCATELYN: She s fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.\n\nNED: She s fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn t know what she s saying.\n\nCATELYN: Lysa s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son s life, if she wasn t certain her husband was murdered?\n\nLUWIN: If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?\n\nCATELYN: They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.\n\nLUWIN: The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark s help. He s the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.\n\nCATELYN: He spent half his life fighting Robert s wars. He owes him nothing. (To NED) Your father and brother rode south once on a king s demand.\n\nLUWIN: A different time. Different king.\n\n[The scene shifts to the wild wedding celebration of KHAL DROGO and DAENERYS. Fighting and fornication. DAENERYS looks stricken at everything around her.]\n\nVISERYS: When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.\n\nILLYRIO: If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.\n\nVISERYS: When?\n\nILLYRIO: When their omens favor war.\n\nVISERYS: I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.\n\n[The sex and violence intensify. Two men fight to the death over a woman each is trying to rape. KHAL DROGO watches avidly.]\n\nILLYRIO: A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.\n\n[A knight in Westerosi garb appears. KHAL DROGO greets him in Dothraki. It is JORAH MORMONT, bearing books.]\n\nJORAH: A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nDAENERYS: Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?\n\nJORAH: Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.\n\n[DANY is presented with a chest with three dragon eggs in it.]\n\nILLYRIO: Dragons  eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.\n\nDAENERYS: Thank you, Magister.\n\n[KHAL DROGO rises and strides forward. DAENERYS follows him, looking sick with fear. The Dothraki crowd behind her as she goes. The KHAL leads her to a white mare.]\n\nDAENERYS: She s beautiful.   Ser Jorah, I don t know how to say  thank you  in Dothraki.\n\nJORAH: There is no word for  thank you  in Dothraki.\n\n[The KHAL puts DANY on her horse and mounts his.]\n\nVISERYS: Make him happy.\n\n[The scene shifts to the seaside at sunset. The KHAL begins to unwrap DANY s dress. She is sobbing. He touches the tears on her face.]\n\nKHAL DROGO: No.\n\nDAENERYS: Do you know the Common Tongue?\n\nKHAL DROGO: No.\n\nDAENERYS: Is  no  the only word that you know?\n\nKHAL DROGO: No.\n\n[He takes off her gown and bends her down.]\n\n[The scene shifts to Winterfell. Tyrion and the Hound are seated outside the day after the banquet.]\n\nTHE HOUND: Rough night, Imp?\n\nTYRION: If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.\n\nTHE HOUND: I didn t pick you for a hunter.\n\nTYRION: The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.\n\nTHE HOUND: It s not hunting if you pay for it.\n\n[The king and Ned come into view.]\n\nROBERT: Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?\n\nNED: No, but I m still better than you.\n\nROBERT: I know what I m putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You re a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I ve got.\n\nNED: I hope I ll serve you well.\n\nROBERT: You will. And I ll make sure you don t look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let s go kill some boar!\n\n[The king s party rides off, NED nodding goodbye to BRAN, whose wolf pup begins sniffing at his feet.]\n\nBRAN: Come on, you.\n\n[BRAN begins climbing, his wolf pup crying at the bottom of the castle wall. As he nears the top, he hears a woman and man moaning. Peering in the window, he sees CERSEI and JAIME having sex. CERSEI sees BRAN.]\n\nCERSEI: Stop. STOP.\n\n[JAIME runs and grabs BRAN at the window.]\n\nJAIME: Are you completely mad?\n\nCERSEI: He saw us.\n\nJAIME: It s all right. It s all right.\n\nCERSEI: He saw us!\n\nJAIME: I heard you the first time. (To BRAN) Quite the little climber, aren t you? How old are you, boy?\n\nBRAN: Ten\n.\nJAIME: Ten.\n\n[JAIME looks at CERSEI, who gazes back imploringly.]\n\nJAIME: The things I do for love.\n\n[He shoves BRAN out the window.]\n\n/ BLACKOUT /\n\n", "episode_7": "\n\nTrumpets sounds from the Lannister camp. Going inside a tent, we see Tywin Lannister sharpening his knifes, preparing to skin a deer, while Jaime Lannister starts reading the received letter from Ned Stark.\n\nJaime Lannister:  \"Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain\"\nUh, \"arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown.\"\nPoor Ned Stark. Brave man, terrible judgment.\nTywin Lannister:  Attacking him was stupid.\nTywin Lannister:  Lannisters don't act like fools.\nAre you gonna say something clever? Go on, say something clever.\nJaime Lannister:  Catelyn Stark took my brother.\nTywin Lannister:  Why is he still alive?\nJaime Lannister:  Tyrion?\nTywin Lannister:  Ned Stark.\nJaime Lannister:  One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.\nTywin Lannister:  Why is he still alive?\nJaime Lannister:  It wouldn't have been clean.\nTywin Lannister:  Clean...\nTywin Lannister:  You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.\nJaime Lannister:  I could care less what anyone thinks of me.\nTywin Lannister:  Now that's what you want people to think of you.\nJaime Lannister:  It's the truth.\nTywin Lannister: When you hear them whispering \"Kingslayer\" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?\nJaime Lannister:  Of course it bothers me.\nTywin Lannister:  The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.\nI suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness.\nI'm giving you half of our forces. 30,000 men.\nYou will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts.\nJaime Lannister:  I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.\nTywin Lannister:  He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.\nAnd every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.\nJaime Lannister:  So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..\nTywin Lannister:  No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!\nIf another House can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a House to be feared.\nYour mother's dead. Before long I'll be dead.\nAnd you and your brother and your sister and all of her children.\nAll of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground. It's the family name that lives on. It's all that lives on.\nNot your personal glory, not your honor, but family.\nDo you understand?\nJaime nods gently.\nTywin Lannister:  Hmm.\nYou're blessed with abilities that few men possess.\nYou are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms.\nAnd you are still blessed with youth.\nAnd what have you done with these blessings, huh? You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings.\nOne a madman, the other a drunk.\nThe future of our family will be determined in these next few months.\nWe could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.\nOr we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did.\nI need you to become a man you were always meant to be.\nNot next year. Not tomorrow. Now.\nSubmissive as he looks, Jaime walks out of the tent.\nBack at a garden in Kings Landing, we see Queen Cersei approaching the sitting Ned Stark.\n\nCersei Lannister:  You're in pain.\nNed Stark:  I've had worse, my lady.\nCersei Lannister:  Perhaps it's time to go home.\nNed Stark:  The South doesn't seem to agree with you.\nNed Stark:  I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.\nCersei Lannister:  Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?\nNed Stark:  Has he done this before?\nCersei Lannister:  Jaime would have killed him.\nNed Stark:  My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.\nNed Stark:  Your brother Or your lover?\nCersei Lannister:  The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.\nNed Stark:  Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.\nNed Stark:  We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.\nNed Stark:  My son saw you with him.\nCersei Lannister:  Do you love your children?\nNed Stark:  With all my heart.\nCersei Lannister:  No more than I love mine.\nNed Stark:  And they are all Jaime's.\nCersei Lannister:  Thank the Gods.\nIn the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways.\nIn the morning, he doesn't remember.\nNed Stark:  You've always hated him.\nCersei Lannister:  Hated him? I worshiped him.\nEvery girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath.\nAnd when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life.\nThen that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, \"Lyanna\".\nYour sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me.\nNed Stark:  When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.\nYou must be gone by then. You and your children.\nI will not have their blood on my hands.\nGo as far away as you can, with as many men as you can.\nBecause wherever you go, Robert's wrath will follow you.\nCersei Lannister:  And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself.\nJaime told me about the day King's Landing fell.\nHe was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up.\nAll you needed to do was climb the steps yourself.\nSuch a sad mistake.\nNed Stark:  I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.\nCersei Lannister:  Oh, but it was.\nWhen you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.\nCersei walks off.\nLittlefinger is looking outside his brothel window. Seeing mothers bathing their crying children.\nSeemingly in thought, he decides to close it. Meanwhile, Ros and Ameca are playing with each other, while Ros is loudly moaning.\n\nRos:  Come here.\nOh yes, oh. Oh yes yes yes.\nPetyr Baelish:  No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?\nRos:  Yes, My Lord.\nPetyr Baelish:  Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman.\nWell, go ahead. Slowly.\nYou're not fooling them. They just paid you. They know what you are.\nThey know it's all just an act.\nYour job is to make them forget what they know.\nThat takes time. You need to Ease into it.\nGo ahead. Ease into it.\nHe's winning you over in spite of yourself.\nYou're starting to like this.\nHe wants to believe you.\nHe's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?\nHe knows he's better than other men.\nHe's always known it deep down inside. Now he has proof.\nHe's so good, he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there.\nOvercoming your very nature.\nRos:  Why don't you join us, My Lord?\nPetyr Baelish:  I'm saving myself for another.\nRos:  What she doesn't know won't hurt her.\nPetyr Baelish:  A stupid saying.\nWhat we don't know is usually what gets us killed.\nRos:  She must be very beautiful.\nPetyr Baelish:  No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though.\nRos:  I do believe my lord's in love.\nPetyr Baelish:  For many years. Most of my life really.\nPlay with her ass.\nAnd she loved me too. I was her little confidant, her plaything.\nShe could tell me anything, anything at all.\nShe told me about all the horses that she liked.\nThe castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry.\nA northerner with a jaw like an anvil.\nSo I challenged him to a duel. I mean, why not? I'd read all the stories.\nThe little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories.\nIn the end, she wouldn't even let him kill me.\n\"He's just a boy\", she said. \"Please don't hurt him\".\nSo he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by, and off they went.\nRos:  Is she still married to him?\nPetyr Baelish:  Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.\nAnd she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen.\nShe loves him, I'm afraid.\nAnd why wouldn't she? I mean, who could compare to him? He's just so...good.\nDo you know what I learned, losing that duel? I learned that I'll never win. Not that way.\nThat's their game, their rules. I'm not going to fight them.\nI'm going to fuck them. That's what I know. That's what I am.\nAnd only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.\nRos:  And what do you want?\nPetyr Baelish:  Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is.\nNow wash yourselves. Both of you are working tonight.\nHmm.\nWhile Ros and Ameca are both walking out, Littlefinger watches them leave.\nBack at Winterfell, Osha is walking into a stable, carrying a bale of straw. While bending over and laying down the bale of sraw, Theon Grayjoy arrives.\n\nTheon Greyjoy:  You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?\nWhere I come from, we don't show mercy to criminals.\nWhere I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord, at low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes. The sea would come in closer and closer.\nYou'd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time.\nOsha:  Where is it you come from?\nTheon Greyjoy:  The Iron Islands.\nOsha:  They far away?\nTheon Greyjoy:  You've never heard of the Iron Islands?\nOsha:  Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.\nTheon Greyjoy:  Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore.\nIn civilized lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles.\nOsha:  And what's that?\nTheon Greyjoy:  Lord.\nOsha:  Why?\nTheon Greyjoy:  Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.\nOsha:  What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?\nTheon Greyjoy:  I will be lord after my father.\nOsha:  So you're not lord now?\nTheon Greyjoy:  No, you...You having a go at me? Is that it?\nOsha:  I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.\nTheon Greyjoy:  I'm not a Southerner.\nOsha:  You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.\nTheon Greyjoy:  You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?\nOsha:  Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what \"impunent\" means.\nTheon Greyjoy:  Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.\nDo you want to lose that chain?\nMaester Luwin:  Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.\nTheon Greyjoy:  I thought she was our prisoner.\nMaester Luwin:  Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?\nAgitated as he is, Theon runs off.\nMaester Luwin:  Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.\nOsha:  I'm used to worse than him.\nMaester Luwin:  I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.\nMaester Luwin:  Why did you come here?\nOsha:  Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.\nAs far South as South goes, before the long night comes.\nMaester Luwin:   Why? What are you afraid of?\nOsha:  There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.\nMaester Luwin:   Owls and Shadowcats and...\nOsha:  I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.\nMaester Luwin:   The \"things\" you speak of-- they've been gone for thousands of years.\nOsha:  They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping.\nAnd they ain't sleeping no more.\nSeeing the wall from above, we see Jon and Sam walking towards the edge.\n\nSamwell Tarly:  I miss girls.\nNot even talking to them. I never talked to them.\nJust looking at them, hearing them giggle.\nDon't you miss girls?\nBoth Jon and Sam are looking down and see a galloping horse.\nRiders. The horn. We have to blow the horn.\nJon Snow:  Why is he alone?\nSamwell Tarly:  One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for...\nJon Snow:  There's no rider.\nWhile the Wall's gate is being opened, the horse gallops inside the tunnel. Jon and Sam are rushing down, while the stable boy has caught the horse, bringing him towards Jon, Sam and Jeor Mormont.\nNight Watch stable boy:  Whoa, boy, whoa.\nJon Snow:  That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.\nWhere's my Uncle?\nReturning to Kings Landing, we see Ned and Tomard walking down a hallway. Renly running towards them calling...\n\nRenly Baratheon:  Ned! It's Robert.\nWe were hunting...a boar...\nSurprised yet being shocked as he is, Ned walks towards Robert's chambers. Inside Robert's room, we see Cersei, Joffrey, Barristan Selmy and Maester Pycelle are all present. Robert speaks to joffrey, whom is sitting beside him.\nRobert Baratheon:  I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.\nI was never meant to be a father.\nGo on. You don't want to see this.\nJoffrey walks out of the room.\nRobert Baratheon:  My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust.\nIt stinks. It stinks like death. Don't think I can't smell it.\nI paid the bastard back, Ned. I drove my knife right through his brain.\nYou ask them if I didn't. Ask them!\nI want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.\nAnd I want everyone to taste the boar that got me.\nNow leave us, the lot of you. I need to talk to Ned.\nCersei Lannister:  Robert, my sweet...\nRobert Baratheon:  Out, all of you!\nOn Robert's demand, everyone left except for Ned. As soon as the door shuts, Ned talks to Robert.\nNed Stark:  You damned fool.\nRobert Baratheon:  Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say.\n\"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of...\" you know how it goes. Fill in the damn titles.\n\"I hereby command Eddard of House Stark\" titles, titles.\n\"To serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my death.\nTo rule in my stead, until my son Joffrey comes of age\".\nGive it over.\nNed hands over the letter and quill. It is seen that Robert's signs the letter with his autograph.\nRobert Baratheon:  Give it to the council after I'm dead.\nAt least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.\nYou'll rule now. You'll hate it worse than I did, but you'll do it well.\nThe girl, Daenerys. You were right. Varys, Littlefinger, my brother. Worthless.\nNo one to tell me \"no\" but you. Only you.\nLet her live. Stop it, if it's not too late.\nNed Stark:  I will.\nRobert Baratheon:  And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me.\nNed Stark:  I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.\nRobert Baratheon:  My memory.\nKing Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig.\nGive me something for the pain and let me die.\nNed walks out of Robert's chamber. Maester Pycelle, Renly, Varys and Barristan Selmy are waiting outside.\nNed Stark:  Give him milk of the poppy.\nBoth Maester Pycelle as Renly re-enter Robert's chamber. Still outside a conversation occurs.\nBarristan Selmy:  He was reeling from the wine.\nHe commanded us to step aside, but I failed him.\nNed Stark:  No man could have protected him from himself.\nLord Varys:  I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?\nBarristan Selmy:  His squire, from the king's own skin.\nNed Stark:  His squire? The Lannister boy?\nLord Varys:  Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.\nI do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.\nNed Stark:  His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.\nWhatever arrangements you made, unmake them. At once.\nLord Varys:  I'm afraid those birds have flown.\nThe girl is likely dead already.\nNed walks off.\nEntering Khal Drogo's tent, Daenerys is braiding Khal Drogo's hair. The conversation is spoken in the Dothraki language.\n\nKhal Drogo:  The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world.\nKhal Drogo:  The earth ends at the black salt sea. No horse can cross the poison water.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea.\nThe dirt where I was born.\nKhal Drogo:  Not dirt. Lands.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  Lands, yes...\nThere are thousands of ships in the free cities. Wooden horses that fly across the sea.\nKhal Drogo:  Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  It's not a chair. It's a... Throne\nKhal Drogo:  Throne?\nDaenerys Stormborn:  A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen.\nKhal Drogo:  A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse.\nKhal Drogo kisses Daenerys and walks out of the tent.\n\nA while later, at one of Vaes Dothrak's markets, Daenerys walks with Jorah Mormont.\n\nDaenerys Stormborn:  Can't you help me make him understand?\nJorah Mormont:  The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.\nHave patience, Khaleesi. We will go home, I promise you.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.\nHave I said something funny, Ser?\nJorah Mormont:  Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right.\nHe had no right to them. He seized them because he could.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  And because he had dragons.\nJorah Mormont:  Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  You don't believe it.\nJorah Mormont:  Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report.\nAs for the rest It was 300 years ago. Who knows what really happened?\nNow if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant Captain, see if he has any letters for me.\nWell, I'll come with you.\nJorah Mormont:  No no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough.\nJorah walks by a few merchants, while a little child is calling him.\nLittle Bird:  Psst, Jorah the Andal.\nThe spider sends his greetings and his congratulations.\nA royal pardon. You can go home now.\nJorah seems to have a change of heart. Meanwhile a merchant is heard from afar.\nWine Merchant:  Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!\nSweet reds! I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor!\nTyrosh pear brandy! Andalish sours! I have them! I have them!\nDanaerys approaches the merchant\nWine Merchant:  A taste for the Khaleesi? I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.\nOne taste and you'll name your first child after me.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.\nJust a taste.\nWine Merchant:  My Lady, you are from Westeros.\nDoreah:  You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen.\nKhaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.\nWine Merchant:  Princess.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.\nWine Merchant:  That? Dornish swill.\nNot worthy of a princess. I have a dry red from the Arbor. Nectar of the Gods.\nLet me give you a cask. Uh... a gift.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  You honor me, Ser.\nWine Merchant:  The honor...the honor is all mine.\nRakharo:  Huh-uh, huh-uh.\nRakharo pulls the cask out of the merchants hands.\nWine Merchant:  You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  I hope to repay your kindness someday.\nJorah Mormont:  Rakharo.\nRakharo:  Huh.\nJorah Mormont:  Put down that cask.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  Is something wrong?\nJorah Mormont:  I have a thirst. Open it.\nWine Merchant:  The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.\nJorah Mormont:  Open it.\nThe wine merchant obeys and opens the cask.\nJorah Mormont:  Pour.\nWine Merchant:  It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  Do as he says.\nWine Merchant:  As the princess commands.\nThe wine merchant poors the wine into a cup.\nWine Merchant:  Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord.\nTell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue.\nJorah Mormont:  You first.\nWine Merchant:  Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.\nBesides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  You will drink.\nThe wine merchant takes Jorah's cup. Looks both Jorah and Daenerys innocently in their eyes, while making a toasting gesture.\nAs soon as his lips touches his cup, he drops it and tries to flee.\nDoreah:  Khaleesi! Stop him!\nAfter a very short chase, Rakharo was able to capture the wine merchant, grabbing the merchants leg with his whip.\nJorah grabs Daenerys's arm.\nJorah Mormont:  Come.\n\nAt the Wall we see Jeor Mormont speaking towards his brothers of the Night's Watch.\n\nJeor Mormont:  You came to us as outlaws, poachers, rapers, killers, thieves.\nYou came alone, in chains, without friends nor honor.\nYou came to us rich and you came to us poor.\nSome of you bear the names of proud houses, others only bastard names or no names at all.\nIt does not matter. All that, is in the past.\nHere, on the wall, are all one house.\nTonight...\nSamwel Tarly:  You're allowed to look happy.\nYou're going to be a Ranger.\nIsn't that what you always wanted?\nJon Snow:  I want to find my Uncle.\nI know he's alive out there. I know he is.\nSamwell Tarly:  I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger.\nIt's the steward's life for me.\nSamwell Tarly:  There's honor in being a steward.\nNot much, really. But there's food.\nJeor Mormont:  Here you begin anew.\nA man of The Night's Watch lives his life for the realm.\nNot for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house or that house.\nNot for gold nor glory nor a woman's love. But for the realm! And all the people in it.\nYou've all learned the words of the vow.\nThink carefully before you say them.\nThe penalty for desertion, is death.\nYou can take your vows here tonight, at sunset.\nDo any of you still keep the old Gods?\nJon Snow stands.\nJon Snow:  I do, my lord.\nJeor Mormont:  You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.\nJon Snow:  Yes, my lord.\nJeor Mormont:  You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall. And your old Gods too, maybe.\nSamwell Tarly:  my lord, might I go as well?\nJeor Mormont:  Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?\nSamwell Tarly:  No, my lord.\nI was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him.\nAlliser ThorneL  Why would you forsake the Gods of your father and your house?\nSamwell Tarly:  The Night's Watch is my house now.\nThe Seven have never answered my prayers. Perhaps the old Gods will.\nJeor Mormont:  As you wish, lad.\nYou've all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths.\nHalder to the builders. Pyp to the stewards. Toad to the builders.\nGrenn to the Rangers. Samwell to the stewards. Matthar to the Rangers.\nDareon to the stewards. Balian to the Rangers. Rast to the Rangers.\nJon to the stewards. Rancer to the builders. Echiel to the builders.\nGordo to the stewards. Niko to the Rangers. Escan to the Rangers.\nVorkoy to the builders. Joby to the stables.

Nelugo to the Rangers.\nMay all the Gods preserve you.\nJaremy Rykker:  Rangers with me.\nOthell Yarwyck:  Builders!\nEveryone walks to their designated leader. Sam, Jon and Pyp walk towards Maester Aemon and await their tasks.\nMaester Aemon:  Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.\nPyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.\nLuke, report to one-eyed Joe in the stables.\nDareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch.\nPresent yourself to Borcas when you arrive. Make no comment about his nose.\nJon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward.\nJon Snow:  Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.\nMaester Aemon:  Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers.\nChange his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.\nJon Snow:  Do you take me for a servant?\nMaester Aemon:  We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.\nBut perhaps we were wrong in that.\nJon Snow:  May I go?\nMaester Aemon:  As you wish.\nJon walks away, while Sam and Pyp follow him.\nSamwell Tarly:  Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?\nJon Snow:  I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.\nHe wanted it and he got it.\nStewards are nothing but maids! I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you! It's not fair.\nPypar:  Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.\nI pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver.\nSo now I'm here. At the end of the world with no one to sing for, but old men and little shits like you.\nI'll never see my family again. I'll never be inside a woman again.\nSo don't tell me about fair.\nSamwell Tarly:  I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?\nPypar:  You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?\nSamwell Tarly:  Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song.\nAngrily Pyp walks off. Sam talks to Jon.\nSamwell Tarly:  Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.\nYou'll be with him day and night.\nYes, you'll clean his clothes.But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle.\nYou'll know everything, be part of everything. And he asked for you himself.\nHe wants to groom you for command.\nJon Snow:  I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger.\nSamwell Tarly:  I always wanted to be a Wizard.\nJon laughs out loud.\nWhat? No, I'm serious.\nSo you'll stay and say your words with me?\n\nIn Kings Landing we see Ned Stark walking with his guards, while Renly approaches.\n\nRenly Baratheon:  Lord Stark, a moment.\nAlone if you will.\n\nRenly Baratheon:  He named you Protector of the Realm.\nHe did.\nRenly Baratheon:  She won't care.\nGive me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.\nNed Stark:  And what should I do with a hundred swords?\nRenly Baratheon:  Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.\nWe must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody.\nProtector of the Realm or no, he who holds the King holds the Kingdom.\nEvery moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.\nBy the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.\nNed Stark:  What about Stannis?\nRenly Baratheon:  Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?\nYou have odd notions about protecting the realm.\nNed Stark:  Stannis is your older brother.\nRenly Baratheon:  This isn't about the bloody line of succession.\nThat didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.\nWhat's best for the Kingdoms? What's best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is.\nHe inspires no love or loyalty. He's not a King. I am.\nNed Stark:  Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.\nHe destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.\nRenly Baratheon:  Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert.\nTell me something: Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?\nNed Stark:  I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.\nNed walks off to his chamber, while Renly is left behind agitated.\n\nEntering Ned Starks chamber, we see him writing a letter to Stannis. Giving orders to Tomard.\n\nNed Stark:  You will sail to dragonstone tonight.\nYou will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.\nNot his steward, not his Captain of the guard, and not his wife.\nOnly Stannis himself.\nTomard:  Yes, My Lord.\nLittlefinger enters the room\nNed Stark:  Now leave us.\nTomard follows Ned's command and leaves his chamber. Littlefingers starts off the conversation.\nPetyr Baelish:  My Lord protector.\nNed Stark:  The King has no true born sons.\nJoffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards.\nPetyr Baelish:  So when the King dies...\nNed Stark:  The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.\nPetyr Baelish:  So it would seem. Unless...\nNed Stark:  There is no \"unless\".\nHe is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that.\nPetyr Baelish:  And he cannot take the throne without your help.\nYou would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.\nNed Stark:  Do you have a shred of honor?\nPetyr Baelish:  You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.\nAll of the power is yours. You need only reach out and take it.\nMake peace with the Lannisters. Release the Imp. Wed your daughter to Joffrey.\nWe have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis.\nAnd if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead.\nNed Stark:  We?\nPetyr Baelish:  You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest.\nNed Stark:  What you suggest is treason.\nPetyr Baelish:  Only if we lose.\nNed Stark:  Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy.\nPetyr Baelish:  We only make peace with our enemies, my Lord.\nThat's why it's called \"making peace\".\nNed Stark:  No. I won't do it.\nPetyr Baelish:  So it will be Stannis and war?\nNed Stark:  There is no other choice. He is the heir.\nPetyr Baelish:  So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly.\nNed Stark:  You promised Catelyn you would help me.\nThe Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms.\nEnough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard. I need the gold cloaks.\nThe City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the King's peace.\nPetyr Baelish:  Look at you. You know what you want me to do.\nYou know it has to be done, but it's not honorable so the words stick in your throat.\nWhen the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect?\nWho do they follow?\nThe man who pays them.\n\n\n\nBack at the Wall, we see Jon, Sam and Ghost, walking with a few Night's Watch brothers, on their way to the Weirwood tree.\nUpon arrival, they're taking their vows.\n\nBoth Jon and Sam:  Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.\nNight gathers and now my watch begins.\nIt shall not end until my death.\nI shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.\nI shall wear no crowns and win no glory.\nI shall live and die at my post.\nI am the sword in the darkness.\nI am the watcher on the walls.\nI am the shield that guards the realms of men.\nI pledge my life and honor to The Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.\nOthell Yarwyck:  You knelt as boys.\nRise now as men of The Night's Watch.\nFellow Night's Watch brothers:  Well done. Well done.\nGhost suddenly appears and is holding onto something.\nSamwell Tarly:  What's he got there?\nJon SnowL  To me, Ghost. Bring it here.\nIt appeared that Ghost was holding a frozen hand.\nSamwell Tarly:  Gods be good!\n\n\n\n\nReturning to a tent in Vaes Dothrak, both Daenarys and Jorah are having a conversation, while walking past the captured wine merchant.\n\nDaenerys Stormborn:  What will they do to him?\nWhen the Khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle, forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  And when he falls?\nI saw a man last nine miles once.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  King Robert still wants me dead.\nThis poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone.\nHe will never leave you alone.\nIf you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you.\nIf you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him.\nHe will never abandon the hunt.\nYou're a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.\nYour son will have Targaryen blood with 40,000 riders behind him.\nDaenerys Stormborn:  He will not have my son.\nHe will not have you either, Khaleesi.\nKhal Drogo enters the tent with a couple of his men. After staring at the scared merchant, he walks towards Daenarys\nKhal Drogo:  Moon of my life. Are you hurt?\nDaenarys gently shakes her head in disapproval. Khal Drogo kisses Daenarys's forehead and talks to Jorah.\nKhal Drogo:  Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did.\nChoose any horse you wish, it is yours.I make this gift to you.\nAnd to my son, the stallion who will mount the world. I will also pledge a gift.\nI will give him the iron chair, that his mother's father sat upon.\nI will give him Seven Kingdoms. I Drogo, will do this.\nI will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends and ride wooden horses across the black salt water as no Khal has done before.\nI will kill the men in iron suits and tear down their stone houses.\nI will rape their women, take their children as slaves and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak.\nThis, I vow. I, Drogo, son of Bharbo. I swear before the Mother of Mountains as the stars look down in witness!\nAs the stars look down in witness!\nThe Khalasar is moving out of Vaes Dothrak, riding underneath the Horse Gate.\nJust as Jorah predicted, the wine merchant is leashed to one of the horses saddles, covered with dirt, struggling to move on.\n\n\n\n\nIn Kings Landing Ned stark walks with his men, while being called by a messenger.\n\nMessenger:  Lord Stark!\nVarly:  Stop!\nNed Stark:  No, all right.\nIt's all right. Let him through.\nMessenger:  Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the Throne Room.\nNed Stark:  King Joffrey?\nMessenger:  King Robert is gone.\nThe Gods give him rest.\nNed seems petrified by the news. Shortly after, Ned arrives close-by the Throne room, where Littlefinger, Varys and a few Stark men await him.\nPetyr Baelish:  All is accomplished. The City Watch is yours.\nNed Stark:  Good. Is Lord Renly joining us?\nLord Varys:  I fear Lord Renly has left the city.\nHe rode through the old gate an hour before dawn with Ser Loras Tyrell and some 50 retainers.\nLast seen galloping South in some haste.\nWhen moving on, affront of the Throne room, Janos Slynt and the Gold Cloaks await Ned.\nJanos Slynt:  We stand behind you, Lord Stark.\n\nMessenger:  All hail his Grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the first of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.\nKing Joffrey:  I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.\nI wish to be crowned within the fortnight.\nToday I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councilors.\nNed Stark:  Ser Barristan, I believe no man here could ever question your honor.\nBarristan Selmy:  King Robert's seal. Unbroken.\n\"Lord Eddard Stark is herein named Protector of the Realm, to rule as Regent until the heir come of age\".\nCersei Lannister:  May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?\nProtector of the realm. Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark? A piece of paper?\nCersei shreds Robert's letter to pieces\nBarristan Selmy:  Those were the King's words.\nCersei Lannister:  We have a new King now.\nLord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel.\nAllow me to return the courtesy. Bend the knee, My Lord.\nBend the knee and swear loyalty to my son and we shall allow you to live out your days in the gray waste you call home.\nYour son has no claim to the throne.\nKing Joffrey:  Liar!\nCersei Lannister:  You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.\nSer Barristan, seize this traitor.\nNed Stark:  Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm.\nCersei Lannister:  You think he stands alone?\nCregor Clegane draws his sword.\nKing Joffrey:  Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!\nNed Stark:  Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.\nEscort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard.\nJanos Slynt:  Men of the Watch!\nThe Gold Cloaks draw their swords.\nNed Stark:  I want no bloodshed.\nTell your men to lay down their swords. No one needs to die.\nPetyr Baelish:  Now!\nSuddenly, the Gold Cloaks switch sides and attack the Stark men. Littlefinger sneaks up to Ned Stark.\nHe grabs him from behind, then holds a dagger to his throat, saying...\nPetyr Baelish:  I did warn you not to trust me.\n\n", "episode_6": "\n\nOpens at King s Landing, assumed to be Ned s quarters. He opens his eyes to find Cersei and King Robert at his bedside.\n\nEddard Stark:  Your pardon, your Grace.\nCersei Baratheon: Do you know what your wife has done?\nEddard Stark:  She did nothing I did not command.\nRobert Baratheon: Who d have thought she had it in her?\nCersei Baratheon: By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?\nEddard Stark:  I am the King s Hand -\nCersei Baratheon: You were the King s Hand!\nEddard Stark:  - trying to keep the peace -\nCersei Baratheon: You shall now be held accountable.\nRobert Baratheon: Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you ll make your peace with Jaime.\nEddard Stark: He butchered my men.\nCersei Baratheon: Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.\nRobert Baratheon: Quiet, woman.\nEddard Stark:  Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.\nCersei Baratheon: I took you for a king.\nRobert Baratheon: Hold your tongue.\nCersei Baratheon: He s attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.\n\nRobert smacks Cersei.\n\nCersei Baratheon: I shall wear this like a badge of honor.\nRobert Baratheon: Wear it in silence or I ll honor you again.\n\nCersei exits the room, slamming the door shut behind her.\n\nRobert Baratheon: See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not  That was not kingly.\nEddard Stark:  If we don t act  there will be a war.\nRobert Baratheon: So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King s Landing. She s had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.\nEddard Stark:  And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?\nRobert Baratheon: I m half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don t know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don t want to know. This is what matters - I can t rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other s throats, so enough!\nEddard Stark:  As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.\nRobert Baratheon: Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I m the king, I get what I want  I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it s true. You were the brother I chose. We ll talk when I return from the hunt.\n\nRobert throws the Hand of the King s badge onto the bed where Ned is laying.\n\nEddard Stark: The hunt?\nRobert Baratheon: Killing things clears my head. You ll have to sit on the throne while I m away. You ll hate it more than I do.\nEddard Stark: The Targaryen girl -\nRobert Baratheon: Seven hells! Don t start with her again! The girl will die and I ll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the mother I ll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister.\n\nRobert exits the room, slamming the door shut behind him. Ned picks up the badge and looks at it.\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nBack at Vaes Dothrak across the sea, Daenerys is holding one of her prized dragon eggs. She looks up at a pot of coals inside of her tent. She walks over and places the egg into the coals. Irri walks into the tent.\n\nIrri: Khaleesi?\n\nDaenerys picks up the egg from the coals.\n\nIrri: Oh, Khaleesi!\n\nIrri takes the egg from her hands, dropping it instantly because of the heat. She looks at Daenerys  hands and there are no burn marks. The two compare hands, Irri s have burn marks.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen: You re hurt.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nA raven caws. Bran is shooting his bow in the courtyard. The raven flies to the crypts of Winterfell, Bran follows. As he enters, again making eye contact with the bird. The raven flies deeper into the crypts. We then see Bran sleeping in his bed, showing that this was another vision, we hear footsteps running towards his door. His door swings opens and Bran sits up in bed breathing heavily. Hodor is carrying the contraption that Tyrion brought the blueprints for. Bran smiles. We then cut to the woods of Winterfell where Bran is shouting as he s riding on the back of a horse.\n\nRobb Stark: Not too fast.\nBran Stark: Come on, Dancer. (to his horse)\nTheon Greyjoy: When are you gonna tell him?\nRobb Stark: Not now.\nTheon Greyjoy: Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.\nRobb Stark: You re talking about war.\nTheon Greyjoy: I m talking about justice.\nRobb Stark: Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.\nTheon Greyjoy: A Lannister put his spear through your father s leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -\nRobb Stark:You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!\nTheon Greyjoy: You re not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They ve already started the war. It s your duty to represent your House when your father can t.\nRobb Stark: And it s not your duty, because it s not your House.\n\nIt goes silent, Bran can no longer be heard jeering at his horse. Robb looks at Theon and stands up looking through the woods.\n\nRobb Stark: Where s Bran?\nTheon Greyjoy: I don t know. It s not my House.\n\nTheon stands up and walks away from Robb, who begins to look around. We cut to Bran riding slowly through the woods. We see someone creeping up behind him as his horse is nickering. As Bran enters a clearing, several Wildlings surround him.\n\nBran Stark: Robb?\nOsha: All alone in the deep dark woods.\nBran Stark: I m not alone, my brother is with me.\nWildling: I don t see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?\nOsha: Oh, that s a pretty pin. Silver.\nWildling: We ll take the pin. And the horse. Get down  Be quick about it.\nBran Stark: I can t. The saddle, the straps.\nWildling: What s wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?\nBran Stark: I m Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don t let me be, I ll have you all killed!\nWildling 2: Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.\nOsha: the boy s worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark s own blood. Think what Mance would give us.\n\nA Wildling is cutting Bran s straps to his saddle, accidentally slicing into Bran s leg but he feels no pain.\n\nWildling: Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We re going as far south as south goes. There ain t no white walkers down in Dorne.\n\nRobb comes into view, behind the four Wildlings.\n\nRobb Stark: Drop the knife. Let him go and I ll let you live.\n\nOne of the Wildlings storms at Robb who evades an axe attack. Robb counters, slicing the Wildling s throat. Osha charges Robb who tosses her spins her around by her hair. He fights off and kills the other Wildling. The Wilding in charge has Bran off of his horse with a knife at his throat, meanwhile Robb has Osha (female Wildling) and a knife to her throat.\n\nBran Stark: Robb!\nWildling: Shut up! Drop the blade!\nBran Stark: No, don t.\nWildling: Do it.\n\nRobb looks at Bran and then back up at the Wildling. He then slowly sets his sword on the ground, still gripping Osha by her hair. He looks back up at the Wildling who suddenly gets an arrow through his chest from his back. As he drops to the ground bleeding, we see Theona few yards behind him with a bow. The Wildling falls dead, Theon approaches. Robb releases Osha from his grasp as Theon walks over drawing his bow on her. Robb moves over to Bran.\n\nRobb Stark: Are you all right?\nBran Stark: Yes, it doesn t hurt.\nTheon Greyjoy: Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you re not a man until you ve killed your first enemy. Well done.\nRobb Stark: Have you lost your mind? What if you d missed?\nTheon Greyjoy: He would have killed you and cut Bran s throat.\nRobb Stark: You don t have the right -\nTheon Greyjoy: To what, to save your brother s life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it.\nRobb Stark: What about her?\nOsha: Give me my life, my lord, and I m yours.\nRobb Stark: We ll keep her alive.\n\nOsha gives a sigh of release, Theon releases his bow and Robb, holding Bran, assures that he s okay.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nNow at the Eyrie, Tyrion is sleeping and rolls to his side at the very edge of his skycell. He awakes, quickly moving back to the wall. He steps over to the door to his cell and begins pounding on it.\n\nTyrion Lannister: Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!\n\nThe door swings open and Mord rushes in, batting Tyrion to the opposite side of the cell.\n\nMord: Dwarf man making noise!\nTyrion Lannister: How would you like to be rich?\nMord: Dwarf man still making noise.\nTyrion Lannister: My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I m prepared to give you lots of gold.\n\nMord quickly searches Tyrion s pockets for gold.\n\nMord: No gold!\nTyrion Lannister: Well, I don t have it here.\nMord: No gold! Fuck off.\n\nMord hits Tyrion once more with his club then storms out of the cell, shutting the door behind him.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nNow in a hall at King s Landing. We see Syrio shutting a door and holding two wooden swords. He slowly steps down towards Arya and tosses her one of the swords, she seamlessly catches it as he takes his fighting stance.\n\nArya Stark:  I don t want to practice today.\nSyrio Forel: No?\nArya Stark: They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don t care about stupid wooden swords.\nSyrio Forel: You are troubled.\nArya Stark:  Yes -\nSyrio Forel: Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.\nArya Stark: I don t like dolls and k -\nSyrio Forel: You re not here. You re with your trouble. If you re with your trouble when fighting happens \n\nArya makes a move for Syrio, who quickly counters and puts her on her back.\n\nSyrio Forel:   More trouble for you. Just so  How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?\nSyrio Forel: The old and the new.\nSyrio Forel: There is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death -  Not today. \n\nSyrio steps back and tosses Arya her sword back, she catches it and assumes the counter position.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBack across the sea in Vaes Dothrak, we re inside a large communal tent. Daenerys is centered around everyone and eating the heart of a horse a the Dothraki and a priest chant around her. Her husband Khal Drogo looks on in anticipation as she continues eating.\n\nViserys Targaryen: She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn t my horse.\nJorah Mormont: She s doing well.\nViserys Targaryen: She ll never keep it down.\n\nShe keeps eating the heart, nearing the end. The Dothraki onlookers all chant in unison, getting louder and louder. The priestess is also chanting, louder and louder. Khal Drogo stares more intently at his wife, she stares back. The chanting grows louder, as does the priestess.\n\nViserys Targaryen: Tell me what she is saying.\nJorah Mormont:  The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him  and their wives will weep tears of blood. \n\nThe eating and chantines intensifies as Viserys looks on in shock.\n\nJorah Mormont: She s going to have a boy.\nViserys Targaryen: He won t be a real Targaryen. He won t be a true dragon.\n\nAs the chanting is at it s loudest, Daenerys has finished with the heart. Everyone looks on in anticipations, she wretches forward, on the verge of puking. The chanting suddenly halts. Khal Drogo leans in and looks intensly. Daenerys holds everything in and sobs. Her hands bloody, she slowly sits up, keeping everything in as she gulps the final bite. The priestess begins to speak, Jorah translates directly for Viserys.\n\nJora:  The stallion who mounts the world.  The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd.\n\nDaenerys rises to her feet, speaking in Dothraki to the room.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen: A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!\n\nThe room begins chanting,  Rhaego! Rhaego!  As the chanting grows louder and louder, Drogo stands up and walks up to Daenerys.\n\nViserys Targaryen: They love her.\n\nThe room s chanting gets even louder. Drogo hugs his wife at her thighs and hoists her up, carrying her around the room.\n\nJorah Mormont: She truly is a queen today.\n\nJorah looks to his right towards Viserys, who has now slipped out. We cut to Daenerys  tent. Inside, Viserys opens the container that holds her dragon eggs. He sighs and then puts them into a sack. Jorah walks into the tent behind him, blocking the door.\n\nJorah Mormont: Don t let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.\nViserys Targaryen: It s not my law.\nJorah Mormont: They don t belong to you.\nViserys Targaryen: Whatever is hers is also mine.\nJorah Mormont: Once, perhaps.\nViserys Targaryen: If I sell one egg, I ll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army.\nJorah Mormont: And you have all three.\nViserys Targaryen: I need a large army  I m the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it  How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don t think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don t think I know what you want? I don t care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go.\nJorah Mormont: You can go, but you can t have the eggs.\nViserys Targaryen: You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?\nJorah Mormont: It means everything to me.\nViserys Targaryen: And yet here you stand?\nJorah Mormont: And here I stand.\n\nViserys and Jorah stare at each other for a moment, before Viserys drops the sack containing the dragon eggs to the floor. Jorah steps aside, unblocking the exit. Viserys leaves.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBack at the skycell below the Eyrie. Tyrion is again shouting for Mord.\n\nTyrion Lannister: Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!\nMord: Noise again!\nTyrion Lannister: About the gold -\nMord: No gold!\nTyrion Lannister: Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession  is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.\nMord: Where?\nTyrion Lannister: Where? I don t know where, but when they free me -\nMord: You want free? Go be free. (points out of the skycell)\nTyrion Lannister: Have you ever heard the phrase  Rich as a Lannister ? Of course you have. You re a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase,  a Lannister always pays his debts.  If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.\nMord: What message?\nTyrion Lannister: Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.\n\nWe cut to the throne room, where Lady Arryn and her son Robin are sitting on the throne, at the helm of the room. Catelyn is standing next to them, as Robin is tapping a knife against the throne itself very annoyingly.\n\nLysa Arryn: You wish to confess your crimes?\nTyrion Lannister: Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.\nLysa Arryn: Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man.\nTyrion Lannister: Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I m a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I m not particularly good at violence, but I m good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle s boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and  I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -\nLysa Arryn: Silence!\nRobin Arryn:What happened next?!\nLysa Arryn: What do you think you re doing?\nTyrion Lannister: Confessing my crimes.\nCatelyn Stark: Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister s husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.\nTyrion Lannister: Oh, I m very sorry. I don t know anything about all that.\nLysa Arryn: You ve had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor.\nTyrion Lannister: Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King s Justice? I m accused and demand a trial.\nLysa Arryn: If you re tried and found guilty, then by the king s own laws you will pay with your life.\nTyrion Lannister: I understand the law.\nLysa Arryn: We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.\n\nSeveral men begin unwinding a giant crank on one side of the room. In between Tyrion and the raised throne is what looks like a well. The well s floor begins to open and wind comes howling through. Robin begins giggling and rapidly clapping his hands. Tyrion looks down and sees that it s a great distance through this Moon Door to the ground, he would inevitably die if he had to go out this  door .\n\nLysa Arryn: You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other.\nTyrion Lannister: No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.\n\nSubdued laughter fills the room, Catelyn and Lysa exchange looks.\n\nLysa Arryn: You have that right.\nKnight 1: My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion.\nKnight 2: The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.\nKnight 3: I ll fight for you, my Lady.\nKnight 4: It ll be my honor.\nKnight 5: The honor should be mine.\nRobin Arryn: Make the bad man fly!\nLysa Arryn: Ser Vardis  You re quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?\nSer Vardis: With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.\nTyrion Lannister: Agreed.\nLysa Arryn: You demanded a trial by combat.\nTyrion Lannister: Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.\nSer Vardis: My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp s champion for you.\nTyrion Lannister: I wouldn t be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.\n\nThe room shudders.\n\nLysa Arryn: The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.\nTyrion Lannister: Send a raven for him, I m happy to wait.\nLysa Arryn: The trial will be today.\nTyrion Lannister: Do I have a volunteer?\n\nAgain, the majority of the room laughs quietly.\n\nTyrion Lannister: Anyone?... Anyone?\nLysa Arryn: I think that we can assume that no one is willing -\nBronn: I ll stand for the dwarf.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn the woods, outside of King s Landing.\n\nLancel Lannister: More wine, your Grace?\nRobert Baratheon: Oh, what was I saying?\nRenly Baratheon: A simpler time.\nRobert Baratheon: It was! It was. You re too young to remember. Wasn t it, Selmy?\nBarriston: It was, your Grace.\nRobert Baratheon: The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today.\nRenly Baratheon: Sounds exhilarating.\nRobert Baratheon: Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. (laughs) You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?\nRenly Baratheon: Once, I think.\nRobert Baratheon: You think? I think you d remember. Back in our day, you weren t a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it  making the eight. \nRenly Baratheon: Those were some lucky girls.\nRobert Baratheon: You ever make the eight, Barristan?\nBarristan Selmy: I don t believe so, your Grace.\nRobert Baratheon: (laughs) Those were the days!\nRenly Baratheon: What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?\nRobert Baratheon: Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you re speaking to the King.\nRenly Baratheon: I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and  make the eight. \nLancel Lannister: More wine, your Grace?\n\nRenly walks off in the opposite direction of the group. Robert takes a large swig off of the wine and quickly continue walking.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn the throne room of King s Landing. Ned sits upon the throne as a fill in for Robert, as he is Hand of the King. Baelish is at his right and Grand Maester Pycelle to his left. The room is filled with people.\n\nMan: They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took  em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: Brigands, most likely.\nMan: They weren t thieves, they didn t steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: It s the King s Hand you re addressing, not the king. The king is hunting.\n\nA second man walks forward and empties a sack out onto the floor. It s a pile of fish.\n\nPetyr Baelish: Fish. The sigil of House Tully. (whispers to Ned) Isn t that your wife s House - Tully - my Lord Hand?\nEddard Stark:  These men, were they flying a sigil?   A banner.\nMan: None, your  Hand. The one who was leading them  Taller by a foot than any man I ve ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.\nPetyr Baelish: (whisper) That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.\nEddard Stark:  You re describing Ser Gregor Clegane.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.\nPetyr Baelish: I ve heard him called  Tywin Lannister s mad dog.  I m sure you have as well. (whispering to Ned) Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?\nGrand Maester Pycelle: If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king s protection, it would be -\nPetyr Baelish: It would be almost abrasion as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: Wel \nEddard Stark:  I cannot give you back your homes or restore your debt of life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion.\n\nBeric Dondarrion steps from the back of the room forward.\n\nEddard Stark:  You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor s keep.\nBeric Dondarrion: As you command.\n\nNed stands up with the assistance of a cane. He steps forward.\n\nEddard Stark:  In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: My lord  This  This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert s return.\nEddard Stark:  Grand Maester Pycelle.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: My Lord.\nEddard Stark:  Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.\n\nThe men all bow their heads in acknowledgement. Ned steps down from the throne, Baelish follows him, speaking only to Ned.\n\nPetyr Baelish: A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion s tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers.\nEddard Stark: Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBack at the Eyrie throne room in the Vale. The men again crank and the Moon Door is opened. Ser Vardis prepares himself with a sword, shield and full body of armor. Bronn refuses a shield and is only wearing leather clothes. Robin Arryn screams  fight  and the two men move forward. Multiple times Vardis swings forward and multiple times Bronn casually steps to the side, causing Vardis to waste his energy. Bronn moves backwards as Vardis continues to swing away, eventually up a staircase. Bronn hops over the staircase railing, again avoiding Vardis  attacks. Lysa screams  Stand and fight, coward!  Bronn kicks over a candle stand in front of Vardis. Vardis steps over it and is again on the offensive, moving Bronn towards the center of the room, close to the now opened Moon Door. The men hold one another off directly in front of the door, Vardis appearing to have the edge. Robin is giggling as Tyrion looks worried. Bronn muscles Vardis  blade away from him and steps to the side. Vardis yet again goes excessively offensive and swings for the fences and Bronn keeps stepping away. Vardis moves Bronn again to the middle of the room, as he swings for Bronn s head, Bronn ducks and stabs Vardis in the belly. The room is in disbelief. Vardis moves forward, muscling through the pain. Bronn side-steps him a few more times and slices through his back. Vardis swings once more, but Bronn shoves his body towards the Moon Door. Bronn is in complete control as Vardis is defenseless against the door. Bronn looks up at Lysa and Robin who have blank faces - faces of shock - so he thrusts his sword into Vardis  neck, killing him, and pushing him out of the Moon Door.\n\nRobin Arryn: Is it over?\nLysa Arryn: You don t fight with honor!\nBronn: No. He did.\n\nTyrion turns to Mord who uncuffs him.\n\nRobin Arryn: Can I make the little man fly now?\nTyrion Lannister: Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.\n\nRodrik Cassel tosses Tyrion his purse. Tyrion bows before Catelyn, begins walking out, Bronn following. He tosses Mord the purse full of coins.\n\nTyrion Lannister: A Lannister always pays his debts.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAt King s Landing, Sansa Stark and Septa Mordane, both sowing.\n\nMordane: You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.\nSansa Stark: Well, why shouldn t I? We re in the south.\nMordane: It s important to remember where you come from. I m not sure your mother would like these new styles.\nSansa Stark: My mother isn t from the North.\nMordane: I m aware of that.\nSansa Stark: Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?\nMordane: Yes. I have hair.\nSansa Stark: I ve never seen it.\nMordane: Would you like to?\nSansa Stark: No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?\nMordane: I come from a very small village in -\nSansa Stark: Oh, wait. I just realized  I don t care.\nMordane: Sansa -\nSansa Stark: Septa.\nMordane: Now you are being rude.\n\nA door can be heard closing. Prince Joffrey walks in. Sansa s eyes light up as both women stand up.\n\nMordane: My prince.\nSansa Stark: My prince.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?\n\nJoffrey offers Sansa a necklace. She turns around, for him to put it on her, as acceptance.\n\nSansa Stark: It s beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  You ll be queen one day, it s only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?\nSansa Stark: There s nothing to forgive.\nJoffrey Baratheon: You re my lady. One day we ll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them.  I ll never disrespect you again. I ll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You re my lady now, from this day, until my last day.\n\nThe two share their first kiss.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn the woods outside of Winterfell, Theon is riding his horse, alone. He comes to a road and sees a carriage leaving, Ros on the back of it riding south.\n\nTheon Greyjoy: Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!\nRos: Going to King s Landing.\nTheon Greyjoy: In a turnip cart?\nRos: I ll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.\nTheon Greyjoy: And you can afford that?\nRos: Some of my friends are more generous than others.\nTheon Greyjoy: There s a thousand girls like you in King s Landing.\nRos: I ll have lots of company \nTheon Greyjoy: Yes, you ll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can t get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.\nRos: (laughs) And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?\nTheon Greyjoy: Don t be a fool.\nRos: I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King s Landing. Every man for a hundred mules will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there s nothing more for me here. Let s go, Steffon.\nTheon Greyjoy: Let me see it one more time?\nRos: See what?\n\nThe carriage is driving away from Theon, he scrambles and flips Ros a coin. She catches it and lifts up her dress one final time for Theon, while laughing.\n\nTheon Greyjoy: I m going to miss you!\nRos: I know.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAt King s Landing in Ned s quarters. Arya and Sansa await as their father limps forward, using his cane for assistance.\n\nEddard Stark:  I m sending you both back to Winterfell.\nSansa Stark: What?!\nEddard Stark:  Listen -\nSansa Stark: What about Joffrey?\nArya Stark:  Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you re sending us home?\nEddard Stark:  What? No.\nSansa Stark: Please, Father. Please don t.\nArya Stark:  You can t. I ve got my lessons with Syrio. I m finally getting good.\nEddard Stark:  This isn t a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.\nArya Stark:  Can t we take Syrio back with us?\nSansa Stark: Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can t go. I m supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I m meant to be his queen and have his babies.\nArya Stark: Seven hells.\nEddard Stark:  When you re old enough, I ll make you a match with someone who s worthy of you, someone who s brave and gentle and strong -\nSansa Stark: I don t want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He ll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I ll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.\nArya Stark: The lion s not his sigil, idiot. He s a stag, like his father.\nSansa Stark: He is not. He s nothing like that old drunk king.\nEddard Stark:  Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things.\nSansa Stark: Wait!\nArya Stark:  Come on! (dragging Sansa)\nSansa Stark: It s not fair!\n\nThe two exit Ned s room and close the door behind them. Ned slowly makes his way over to his desk, opening the book that Grand Maester Pycelle had given him earlier. The book covers the lineages of all the great Houses of Westeros. Ned turns and reviews the Baratheon page, reading out loud.\n\nEddard Stark:   Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.   Axel Baratheon, black of hair.   Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.   Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.   Robert Baratheon, black of hair.   Joffrey Baratheon  golden-haired. \n\nNed has a revelation and closes the book.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBack at Vaes Dothrak, in a very large hut. It is a celebration. A pig roasts over a center fire as there are drums being played and people dancing everywhere. Viserys stumbles in, clearly drunk.\n\nViserys Targaryen: Daenerys! Where s my sister?\n\nDaenerys and Jorah both look up, noticing her brother on the opposite side of the hut. Drogo, on another side of the hut also sees Viserys. Jorah stands up and begins walking towards Viserys.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen: Stop him.\nViserys Targaryen: Where is she? I m here for the feast. The whore s feast.\nJorah Mormont: Come.\nViserys Targaryen: Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!\n\nA man sitting next to Drogo says something in Dothraki that makes the Khal laugh. Viserys hears this and spins around.\n\nViserys Targaryen: Khal Drogo! I m here for the feast.\nKhal Drogo: (speaks Dothraki, motions to the other side of the hut)\nJorah Mormont: Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.\nViserys Targaryen: That is no place for a king.\nKhal Drogo:  You are no king.\n\nViserys draws his sword, Jorah moves forward, Viserys holds his sword at Jorah.\n\nViserys Targaryen: Keep away from me!\n\nThe drums stop and now everyone in the hut is paying attention.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen: Viserys, please.\nViserys Targaryen: There she is.\nJorah Mormont: Put the sword down. They ll kill us all.\nViserys Targaryen: They can t kill us. They can t shed blood in their sacred city. (moving his sword over everyone in the room, stopping on Daenerys  stomach) But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.\n\nThe Khal is fiercely looking at the situation as Viserys has his blade to Daenerys  stomach. A woman is translating for Drogo as Viserys speaks.\n\nViserys Targaryen: Tell him I want what was bargained for or I m taking you back. He can keep the baby. I ll cut it out and leave it for him.\nKhal Drogo:  (speaks Dothraki)\nViserys Targaryen: What s he saying?\nDaenerys Targaryen: He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold.\nViserys Targaryen: That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.\n\nViserys takes his blade away from Daenerys  stomach and steps back, smiling. Drogo stands up and walks to his wife, placing his hand on her belly as they exchange looks. The Khal says something in Dothraki, two men instantly come up behind Viserys, each holding one of his arms. One man breaks Viserys  right arm as he screams.\n\nViserys Targaryen: No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!\n\nThe two men force Viserys to the ground, still holding him by his arms. The Khal moves towards them and mutters something in Dothraki. A woman tips over a kettle that was over the fire, pouring out it s contents. Drogo throws some golden jewelry into the kettle.\n\nJorah Mormont: Look away Khaleesi.\nDaenerys Targaryen: No.\nViserys Targaryen: No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can t!\n\nThe golden jewelry is now melted down into liquid. Khal Drogo lifts the kettle up and walks over towards the screaming Viserys.\n\nViserys Targaryen: Dany please!\nKhal Drogo: A crown for a king.\n\nKhal Drogo raises the kettle over Viserys  head and pours out the melted gold onto his skull. He screams as the hot liquid solidifies on his skull, the two men release Viserys, he instantly falls to the ground dead.\n\nJorah Mormont: Khaleesi \nDaenerys Targaryen: He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n", "episode_5": "\n\nKing's Landing, Ned Stark arrives at the grounds where the Tourney of the Hand will take place. He enters a tent where Ser Hugh (deceased) is being tended to, he enters to speak with Barristan.\n\nEddard Stark: Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?\nBarristan Selmy: No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.\nEddard Stark: He'd never worn this armor before.\nBarristan Selmy: Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.\nEddard Stark: Who determines the draw?\nBarristan Selmy: All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.\nEddard Stark: Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters.\n\nNed and Barristan both exit the tent and begin walking.\n\nBarristan Selmy: Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.\nEddard Stark: I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.\nBarristan Selmy: You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.\nEddard Stark: My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.\nBarristan Selmy: He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.\nEddard Stark: And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?\nBarristan Selmy: Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.\nEddard Stark: Yes. That will never happen.\nBarristan Selmy: Robert tends to do what he wants.\nEddard Stark: If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.\n\nNed separates from Barristan and enters King Robert s tent. Lancel, Robert s squire, is attempting to dress him in his armor.\n\nLancel Lannister: It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.\nRobert Baratheon: Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.\nEddard Stark: You're too fat for your armor.\nRobert Baratheon: Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?\n\nBoth Robert and Ned begin laughing. Lancel also starts to laugh.\n\nRobert Baratheon: Oh, it s funny, is it?\nLancel Lannister: No, Your Grace.\nRobert Baratheon: No? You don't like the Hand's joke?\nEddard Stark: You're torturing the poor boy.\nRobert Baratheon: You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!\n\nLancel runs out of the tent.\n\nEddard Stark: The breastplate stretcher?\nRobert Baratheon: How long before he figures it out?\nEddard Stark: Maybe you should have one invented.\nRobert Baratheon: All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance.\nEddard Stark: You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.\nRobert Baratheon: Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!\nEddard Stark: And who's going to hit you back?\nRobert Baratheon: Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!\nEddard Stark:There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.\nRobert Baratheon: Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?\nEddard Stark: Aye.\nRobert Baratheon:   Drink.\nEddard Stark: I'm not thirsty.\nRobert Baratheon: Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.\nEddard Stark: Your squire... A Lannister boy?\nRobert Baratheon: Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. \"Cersei Lannister will make a good match\", he told me. \"You'll need her father on your side.\" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood.\nEddard Stark: Robert?\nRobert Baratheon: What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nNow at the jousting track where there are lots of onlookers, cheering. Ser Gregor bows before the King before he and his horse take off down one lane of the track.\n\nEddard Stark: Where's Arya\nSansa Stark: At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.\nSansa Stark: Thank you, Ser Loras.\n\nAfter bowing to Sansa, Loras exchanges looks with Renly Baratheon. Loras then rides and bows before the King, also taking off down the opposite track.\n\nSansa Stark: Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.\nEddard Stark: Hey.\nSansa Stark: I can't watch.\n\nBehind Ned and Sansa.\n\nPetyr Baelish: 100 gold dragons on the Mountain.\nRenly Baratheon: I'll take that bet.\nPetyr Baelish: Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?\nRenly Baratheon: Or you could even buy a friend.\nSansa Stark: He's going to die.\nEddard Stark: Ser Loras rides well.\n\nA trumpet is heard and both competitors race down their lanes. Loras knocks Ser Gregor off of his mount.\n\nRenly Baratheon: Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.\nPetyr Baelish: And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?\nPetyr Baelish: Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really.\nSansa Stark: Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.\nPetyr Baelish: No honor but quite a bit of gold.\n\nGregor gets up off of the ground, shouts for his sword. His squire brings it to him and then Gregor severs his horse s head completely off. The crowd is stunned, Gregor then attacks Loras. Knocking him off of his horse and striking him with his sword. Sandor, the Hound, runs down from the stands and fends off his brother.\n\nRobert Baratheon: Stop this madness in the name of your King!\n\nSandor takes a bow and Gregor storms off. Loras walks up to Sandor, raising his hand in victory.\n\nLoras Tyrell: I owe you my life, Ser.\nSandor Clegane: I'm no Ser.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nStopping for rest, presumed on the Kingsroad on their way to Winterfell.\n\nCatelyn Stark: Remove his hood.\nMarillion: On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold. (singing)\nTyrion Lannister: This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.\nCatelyn Stark: I did... often and loudly.\nTyrion Lannister: Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?\nCatelyn Stark: And why would I do that?\nTyrion Lannister: Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.\nCatelyn Stark: Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.\nTyrion Lannister: Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?\nCatelyn Stark: Five years ago.\nTyrion Lannister: She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here.\nCatelyn Stark: I am not a murderer, Lannister.\nTyrion Lannister: Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!\nCatelyn Stark: The dagger found\nTyrion Lannister: What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?\nRodrik Cassel: Should I gag him?\nTyrion Lannister: Why? Am I starting to make sense?\nRodrik Cassel: My Lady, this way.\n\nA rock slams into one of Catelyn s men, a hill tribe begins to attack. Rodrik moves Catelyn behind a rock, out of harms way. The men, mainly Bronn begin successfully defending against the tribe. Tyrion sees Catelyn pull out a small dagger, he runs over to her and convinces her to cut him loose.\n\nTyrion Lannister: Untie me. If I die, what's the point?\n\nTyrion, now loose, runs over and picks up a shield. He fends off an attack as another of Lady Stark s men kills him. Another tribesman is nearing Catelyn, Tyrion rushes over with his shield, knocks him to the ground and begins slamming it into his throat, directly in front of, and in defense of Catelyn. The battle comes to an end with many of their men defeated.\n\nCatelyn Stark: Rodrik?\nRodrik Cassel: I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself.\nBronn:  Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.\nTyrion Lannister: Well, I'm willing if she is.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBack at Winterfell, Maester Luwin and Bran are at a small table, Luwin trying to teach Bran. Bran is fixed on watching Theon as he is practicing his archery.\n\nMaester Luwin: Bran...\nBran Stark: The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - \"We do not sow\".\nMaester Luwin: Lords?\nBran Stark: The Greyjoys.\nTheon Greyjoy: Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.\nMaester Luwin: And failed rebellions.\nBran Stark: Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.\nMaester Luwin: Good.\nBran Stark: Words - \"Ours is the fury\". Lords - the Baratheons.\nMaester Luwin:: Mhmm.\nBran Stark: The Westerlands - sigil - a lion.\nMaester Luwin: Hmm...\nBran Stark: Words - \"A Lannister always pays his debts.\"\nMaester Luwin: No. A common saying, but not their official motto.\nBran Stark: Lords - the Lannisters.\nMaester Luwin: We're still on their words.\nBran Stark: I don't know them.\nMaester Luwin: You do know them. Think.\nBran Stark: \"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken\".\nMaester Luwin:That's House Martell.\nBran Stark: \"Righteous in wrath\".\nMaester Luwin: House Hornwood.\nBran Stark: \"Family, duty, honor\".\nMaester Luwin:Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?\nBran Stark: \"Family, duty, honor\"... Is that the right order?\nMaester Luwin:You know it is.\nBran Stark: Family comes first?\nMaester Luwin: Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.\nBran Stark: How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?\nMaester Luwin: Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.\nBran Stark: And then she left!\nMaester Luwin: When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely.\nBran Stark: Why did she leave?\nMaester Luwin: I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon.\nBran Stark: Do you know where she is now? Today?\nMaester Luwin:No, I don't.\nBran Stark: Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?\nMaester Luwin: Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.\nBran Stark: I'll never shoot another arrow.\nMaester Luwin: And where is that written?\nBran Stark: You need legs to work a bow.\nMaester Luwin: Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.\nBran Stark: Really?\nMaester Luwin: Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nNow in Theon s quarters inside Winterfell, he s making love to Ros.\n\nTheon Greyjoy: Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.\n\nThey break.\n\nRos: I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.\nTheon Greyjoy: Important enough for the likes of you.\nRos: You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.\nTheon Greyjoy: Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.\nRos: Jealous?\nTheon Greyjoy: Why should I be jealous?\nTheon Greyjoy: Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.\nRos: Might surprise you.\nTheon Greyjoy: Hmm?\nRos: He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.\nTheon Greyjoy: Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.\nRos: You are jealous.\nTheon Greyjoy: I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.\nRos: And what about the Starks?\nTheon Greyjoy: I ve been Lord Stark s ward since I was eight years old.\nRos: A  ward , that s a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again \n\nTheon grabs Ros  neck from behind.\n\nTheon Greyjoy: My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.\nRos: You re a very serious boy.\nTheon Greyjoy: I m not a boy.\nRos: Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock.\nTheon Greyjoy: I don t want to pay for it.\nRos: Then get yourself a wife.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nArya, at King s Landing is running through the halls chasing a cat. She s seen running down a hallway.\n\nArya Stark: Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.\n\nNed is in his chambers at his desk, Varys is speaking to him, walking around securing all of the windows before sitting down to talk more seriously.\n\nVarys: How is your son, my Lord?\nEddard Stark: He'll never walk again.\nVarys: But his mind is sound?\nEddard Stark: So they say.\nVarys:A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?\nVarys: If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him.\nEddard Stark: I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?\nVarys: I didn't trust you.\nEddard Stark: So why do you trust me now?\nVarys: The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.\nEddard Stark: What sort of doom does the King face?\nVarys: The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.\nEddard Stark: Who gave it to him?\nVarys: Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.\nEddard Stark: The squire, Ser Hugh?\nVarys: Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.\nEddard Stark: If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?\nVarys: Someone who could afford it.\nEddard Stark: Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?\nVarys: He started asking questions.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nWe shift to a dark dungeon of King s Landing. Arya is still chasing the cat. She stops to admire a large dragon s skull. She hears two men talking, and hides from them, just in earshot. The two men are Lord Varys and Magister Illyrio Mopatis.\n\nVarys: He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.\nIllyrio Mopatis: And when he knows the truth, what will he do?\nVarys: The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend.\nIllyrio Mopatis: What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?\nVarys: This Hand is not the other.\nIllyrio Mopatis: We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.\nVarys: \"Delay,\" you say. \"Move fast, \" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.\nIllyrio Mopatis: It never was.\n\nThe two men leave, Varys locks a gate behind them. Arya runs to the gate and can t get out. She takes off in the other direction, deeper into the dungeon, to find an exit.\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nVarys enters the Throne Room, where Baelish is standing, looking at the throne.\n\nVarys: The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.\nPetyr Baelish: You do move quietly.\nVarys: We all have our qualities.\nPetyr Baelish: You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.\nVarys: I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.\nPetyr Baelish: Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.\nVarys: Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.\nPetyr Baelish: I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important.\nVarys: Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?\nPetyr Baelish: All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.\nVarys: And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.\nPetyr Baelish: Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.\nVarys: Strictly speaking.\nPetyr Baelish: Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.\nVarys: Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?\nPetyr Baelish: Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?\nVarys: Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.\nPetyr Baelish: Saw me with your own eyes?\nVarys: Eyes I own.\nPetyr Baelish: Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.\nVarys: Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...\nPetyr Baelish: One shudders at the thought.\nVarys: Oh.\nPetyr Baelish: But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.\nVarys: Have you?\nPetyr Baelish: Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.\nVarys: Was that you under the bed?\nPetyr Baelish: And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies  To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm.\nVarys: Oh, please.\nPetyr Baelish: To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --\n\nRenly enters from a different doorway and cuts both men off.\n\nRenly Baratheon: What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming.\nPetyr Baelish: To a small council meeting?\nVarys: Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nArya exits a tunnel outside of King s Landing, at the beach of Blackwater Bay. She heads to the city s gate but is stopped by two guards.\n\nGuard 1: Off with you. No begging.\nArya Stark: I'm not a beggar. I live here.\nGuard 1: D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?\nArya Stark: I want to see my father.\nGuard 2: I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.\nGuard 1: You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.\nArya Stark: My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?\n\nQuick cut to Arya standing in front of Ned at his desk.\n\nEddard Stark: You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.\nArya Stark: They said they were going to kill you.\nEddard Stark: Who did?\nArya Stark: I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.\nEddard Stark: Oh, Arya.\nArya Stark: I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.\nEddard Stark: Where did you hear this?\nArya Stark: In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.\nEddard Stark: What were you doing in the dungeons?\nArya Stark: Chasing a cat.\n\nA knock at the door, Jory pokes his head in.\n\nJory Cassel: Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent.\nEddard Stark: Your name, friend?\nYoren: Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look.\nArya Stark: I'm a girl!\nEddard Stark: Did Benjen send you?\nYoren: No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.\nEddard Stark: Ah, we'll find recruits for you.\nYoren: Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow.\nEddard Stark: Know what?\nYoren: Best said in private, my Lord.\nEddard Stark: Go on. We'll talk more later.\nEddard Stark: Jory, take her safely to her room.\nJory Cassel: Come along, my Lady. You heard your father.\n\nJory escorts Arya to her room.\n\nArya Stark: How many guards does my father have?\nJory Cassel: Here in King's Landing? Fifty.\nArya Stark: You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?\nJory Cassel: No fear on that count, little Lady.\n\nNed and Yoren are now alone in Ned s chambers.\n\nEddard Stark: Well?\nYoren: It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAs Catelyn, Tyrion and her men are arriving to the Vale, they re met by a group of guards.\n\nVardis Egen: You're far from home, Lady Stark.\nCatelyn Stark: To whom do I speak?\nVardis Egen: Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?\nCatelyn Stark: There was no time to send word.\nVardis Egen: May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?\nCatelyn Stark: That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.\nVardis Egen: He doesn't look like a prisoner.\nCatelyn Stark: My sister will decide what he looks like.\nVardis Egen: Yes, my Lady. She will at that.\n\nThe guards all turn their horses and escort Catelyn and her men towards the Eyrie.\n\nTyrion Lannister: The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.\nBronn: Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.\nTyrion Lannister: I like you.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nNed is walking through a courtyard at King s Landing, heading for the King Robert s chambers. He is stopped by a royal steward.\n\nSteward: Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.\nEddard Stark: I need to see the King first -- alone.\nSteward: The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you.\nEddard Stark: Is it about my wife?\nSteward: No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.\n\nNow at the small council meeting with everyone on the council, as well as King Robert.\n\nRobert Baratheon: The whore is pregnant.\nEddard Stark: You're speaking of murdering a child.\nRobert Baratheon: I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.\nEddard Stark: You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.\nRobert Baratheon: Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!\nEddard Stark: Then we're no better than the Mad King.\nRobert Baratheon: Careful, Ned. Careful now.\nEddard Stark: You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?\nVarys: No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child.\nEddard Stark: Based on whose information?\nVarys: Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.\nEddard Stark: Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?\nPetyr Baelish: Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.\nEddard Stark: He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?\nRobert Baratheon: And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army  What then?\nEddard Stark: The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.\nRobert Baratheon: Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.\nVarys: I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?\nRenly Baratheon: We should have had them both killed years ago.\nPetyr Baelish: When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.\nEddard Stark: I followed you into war -  twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.\nRobert Baratheon: She dies.\nEddard Stark: I will have no part in it.\nRobert Baratheon: You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will.\n\nNed removes his badge and places it on the table in front of Robert.\n\nEddard Stark: And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.\nRobert Baratheon: Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nNed is in his chambers quickly packing his things.\n\nEddard Stark: I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.\nJory Cassel: Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you.\nPetyr Baelish: His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word \"treason\" was mentioned.\nEddard Stark: What can I do for you?\nPetyr Baelish: When do you return to Winterfell?\nEddard Stark: Why? What do you care?\nPetyr Baelish: If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you.\nEddard Stark: I don't have the time.\nPetyr Baelish: It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.\n\nBaelish exits Ned s chambers, Ned speaks to Jory briefly and then takes off for Baelish.\n\nEddard Stark: Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?\nJory Cassel: Heward and Wyl.\nEddard Stark: Find them and meet me at the stables.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAt the Eyrie, Catelyn, her men, and Tyrion are all standing in front of Lady Arryn. Her son is sitting on her lap, breastfeeding. He is clearly too old to be doing so.\n\nLysa Arryn: You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, \"the seed is strong.\" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.\nCatelyn Stark: Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-\nLysa Arryn: To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!\nRobin Arryn: Mommy? Is that the bad man?\nLysa Arryn: It is.\nRobin Arryn: He's little.\nLysa Arryn: He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!\nTyrion Lannister: Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.\nLysa Arryn: You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.\nTyrion Lannister: If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.\nRobin Arryn: You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!\nLysa Arryn: Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby.\nRobin Arryn: Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.\nLysa Arryn: Perhaps you will, my little love.\nCatelyn Stark: This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.\nLysa Arryn: Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord.\n\nMord throws Tyrion into a  skycell. \n\nMord: You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBack at King s Landing, inside Renly Baratheon s chambers. He is sitting, shirtless, with Loras Tyrell kneeling beside him shaving his chest. Loras is also shirtless.\n\nLoras Tyrell: Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.\nRenly Baratheon: Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man.\nLoras Tyrell: You're jealous.\nRenly Baratheon: Are you sure this won't hurt?\nLoras Tyrell: Only if I slip.\nRenly Baratheon: And you prefer me like this?\nLoras Tyrell: Mhmm.\nRenly Baratheon: If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.\nLoras Tyrell: I want you.\nRenly Baratheon: My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?\nLoras Tyrell: Hold still.\nRenly Baratheon: All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.\nLoras Tyrell: You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the m l e.\nRenly Baratheon:His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!\nLoras Tyrell: He shouldn't have entered the m l e if he didn't know how to fight.\nRenly Baratheon: Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.\nLoras Tyrell: It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.\nRenly Baratheon: I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.\nLoras Tyrell: Yes well, I guess we'll never know.\n\nFinished with Renly s chest, Loras raises his arm so he can shave his armpit.\n\nRenly Baratheon: Everywhere?\nLoras Tyrell: Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?\nRenly Baratheon: It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.\nLoras Tyrell: It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.\nRenly Baratheon: He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.\nLoras Tyrell: I have an outrageous amount of money.\nRenly Baratheon: Not as much as the Lannisters.\nLoras Tyrell: But a lot more than you.\nRenly Baratheon: Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King.\nLoras Tyrell: Hmm... How did that ever happen?\nRenly Baratheon: Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.\nLoras Tyrell: Do you know who should be King?\nRenly Baratheon: Be serious.\nLoras Tyrell: I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.\nRenly Baratheon: I'm fourth in line.\nLoras Tyrell: And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.\nRenly Baratheon: Stannis?\nLoras Tyrell: Stannis has the personality of a lobster.\nRenly Baratheon: He's still my older brother.\n\nLoras cuts Renly under his arm.\n\nRenly Baratheon: What are you doing?!\nLoras Tyrell: Look at it.\nRenly Baratheon: You cut me!\nLoras Tyrell: It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you.\nLoras Tyrell: You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nCersei enters King Robert s chambers.\n\nCersei Baratheon: I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.\nRobert Baratheon: I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.\nCersei Baratheon: Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.\nRobert Baratheon: I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.\nCersei Baratheon: No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?\nRobert Baratheon: I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them.\nCersei Baratheon: The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.\nRobert Baratheon: It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.\nCersei Baratheon: Is my father wrong?\nRobert Baratheon: Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.\nCersei Baratheon: We still outnumber them.\nRobert Baratheon: Which is the bigger number -- five or one?\nCersei Baratheon: Five.\nRobert Baratheon: Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.\nCersei Baratheon: What do you want?\nRobert Baratheon: We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.\nCersei Baratheon: Our marriage.\n\nThe two begin laughing.\n\nRobert Baratheon: Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?\nCersei Baratheon: Every day.\nRobert Baratheon: How long can hate hold a thing together?\nCersei Baratheon: Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.\nRobert Baratheon: Yes, it is.\nCersei Baratheon: Yes, it tis. What was she like?\nRobert Baratheon: You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?\nCersei Baratheon: At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.\nRobert Baratheon: So why now?\nCersei Baratheon: What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?\nRobert Baratheon: You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.\nCersei Baratheon: I felt something for you once, you know?\nRobert Baratheon: I know.\nCersei Baratheon: Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?\nRobert Baratheon: No. Does that make you feel better or worse?\nCersei Baratheon: It doesn't make me feel anything.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nInside one of Baelish s brothels, Ned is speaking to one of the prostitutes. Jory and Baelish are in the next room.\n\nMhaegen: She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair.\nEddard Stark: Aye.\nMhaegen: Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is.\nEddard Stark: I will.\nMhaegen: And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me.\nEddard Stark: When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?\nMhaegen: He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.\nEddard Stark: She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.\n\nNed breaks off from Mhaegen and enters the same room as Baelish and Jory.\n\nPetyr Baelish: Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink.\nEddard Stark: What do you know of King Robert's bastards?\nPetyr Baelish: Well, he has more than you, for a start.\nEddard Stark: How many?\nPetyr Baelish: Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.\nEddard Stark: And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?\nPetyr Baelish: He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.\nEddard Stark: Come.\n\nJory is staring at one of the whores, who flashes him her breast.\n\nEddard Stark: Jory!\nJory Cassel: My Lord.\n\nNed and Jory leave the brothel with a few of Ned s men. They are suddenly surround by Jaime Lannister and his men.\n\nJaime Lannister: Such a small pack of wolves.\nJory Cassel: Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!\nJaime Lannister: Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.\nPetyr Baelish: What's the meaning of this, Lannister?\nJaime Lannister: Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.\nEddard Stark: I remember him well.\nJaime Lannister: It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?\nEddard Stark:He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.\n\nJaime draws his sword, causing all of them men on both sides to draw their swords, except for Eddard.\n\nPetyr Baelish: My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!\nJaime Lannister: Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.\nJory Cassel: If you threaten my Lord again...\nJaime Lannister: Threaten? As in, \"I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of ?\nEddard Stark: You kill me, your brother's a dead man.\nJaime Lannister: You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!\n\nA fight erupts, first Jaime s men throw spears straight into the chests of two of Ned s men. Ned draws his sword and moves towards Jaime, fending off several guards in the process. Jory gets to Jaime first. Jaime stabs Jory with a dagger straight through his eye. The fighting ceases and Ned moves forward to Jaime, Jaime s men all stop to watch the fight. The two fend each other off, as they break, one of Jaime s guards stabs Ned in the back of the leg with a spear, causing him to fall to the ground. Jaime is openly frustrated and knocks the guard out. He mounts his horse.\n\nJaime Lannister: My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back.\n\nJaime rides off on horseback and his guards follow suit.\n\n", "episode_4": "\n\nOpen to Bran Stark dreaming. He is in the courtyard of Winterfell shooting a bow as a raven flies in. As he approaches it, it flies into the crypt, continuously cawing. As Bran enters the crypt he makes direct eye contact with the raven and sees that it has three eyes. He wakes up. Theon enters just as he wakes up.\n\nOld Nan: The little Lord's been dreaming again.\nTheon Greyjoy: We have visitors.\nBran Stark: I don't want to see anyone.\nTheon Greyjoy: Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.\nBran Stark: I don't want to go.\nTheon Greyjoy: Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! (Hodor enters, hoisting up Bran and carrying him away) Help Bran down the hall.\n\nTyrion standing in front of Robb and Maester Luwin inside the Winterfell castle.\n\nTyrion Lannister:  I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.\nRobb Stark: Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.\nTyrion Lannister: Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?\nRobb Stark: I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.\nTyrion Lannister: Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.\n\nHodor enters carrying Bran.\n\nTyrion Lannister: So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?\nMaester Luwin: He has no memory of that day.\nTyrion Lannister: Curious.\nRobb Stark:  Why are you here?\nTyrion Lannister: Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.\nBran Stark: Kneel, Hodor.\nTyrion Lannister: Do you like to ride, Bran?\nBran Stark: Yes. Well, I mean I did like to.\nMaester Luwin: The boy has lost the use of his legs.\nTyrion Lannister: What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.\nBran Stark: I'm not a cripple.\nTyrion Lannister: Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.\nBran Stark: Will I really be able to ride?\nTyrion Lannister:You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.\nRobb Stark: Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?\nTyrion Lannister: I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.\nRobb Stark: You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.\nTyrion Lannister: Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.\n\nBefore Tyrion exits Winterfell for the brothel, Theon sees him off in the courtyard.\n\nTheon Greyjoy: Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros.\nTyrion Lannister: Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.\nTheon Greyjoy: He's not my master.\nTyrion Lannister: No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?\nTheon Greyjoy: She wasn't feeling well.\nTyrion Lannister: She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?\nTheon Greyjoy: My lady's whereabouts...\nTyrion Lannister: My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?\nTheon Greyjoy: Must have been a pretty sight.\nTyrion Lannister: Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.\nTheon Greyjoy: We were outnumbered 10 to one.\nTyrion Lannister: A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.\nTheon Greyjoy: Careful, Imp.\nTyrion Lannister: I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn the courtyard of Castle Black, Jon Snow is giving the group lessons in fighting. As Alliser marches in with a new recruit, Samwell Tarly.\n\nJon Snow: Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it.\nGrenn: What in seven hells is that?\nPyp: They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.\nAlliser Thorne: Tell them your name.\nSamwell Tarly: Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black.\nRast: Come to take the black pudding.\nAlliser Thorne: Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do.\nSamwell Tarly: I yield. Please, no more.\nAlliser Thorne: On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder.\nJon Snow: Enough! He yielded.\nAlliser Thorne: Looks like the bastard's in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard.\nJon Snow: Are you sure you want to do this?\n\nAlliser has the three guys attack Jon, trying to get to Sam, Jon successfully defends them all off.\n\nGrenn: No. Yield yield yield! I yield.\nAlliser Thorne: We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.\nPyp: Well fought!\nGrenn: Piss off.\nSamwell Tarly: Did he hurt you?\nJon Snow:  I've had worse.\nSamwell Tarly: You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.\nJon Snow: It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.\nGrenn: Why didn't you get up and fight?\nSamwell Tarly: I wanted to. I just couldn't.\nGrenn: Why not?\nSamwell Tarly: I'm a coward. My father always says so.\nJon Snow:  The Wall's no place for cowards.\nSamwell Tarly: You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.\nGrenn: A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.\nPyp: You're too stupid to be a coward.\nGrenn: You're too stupid to be a...\nPyp: Quick now, before summer's over.\nGrenn: Come on here!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nDaenerys and the horde have arrived to the Dothraki homeland.\n\nJorah Mormont: Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.\nViserys Targaryen: A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.\nDaenerys Targaryen: These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.\nViserys Targaryen: I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.\nDaenerys Targaryen: If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?\nJorah Mormont: The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.\nDaenerys Targaryen: But if they did?\nJorah Mormont: King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.\nDaenerys Targaryen: And you know these men?\nJorah Mormont: I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land.\nDaenerys Targaryen: You sold slaves.\nJorah Mormont: Aye.\nDaenerys Targaryen: Why?\nJorah Mormont: I had no money and an expensive wife.\nDaenerys Targaryen: And where is she now?\nJorah Mormont: In another place, with another man.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nViserys is in a tub inside of a tent, being bathed by Doreah.\n\nDoreah: Your Grace?\nViserys Targaryen: Yes, my dear?\nDoreah: They call you the last dragon...\nViserys Targaryen: They do.\nDoreah: You have dragon's blood in your veins?\nViserys Targaryen: It's entirely possible.\nDoreah: What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.\nViserys Targaryen: The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles.\nDoreah: I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.\nViserys Targaryen:Really? Why dragons?\nDoreah: They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.\nViserys Targaryen: Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.\nDoreah: I was not locked in. I have seen things.\nViserys Targaryen: What have you seen?\nDoreah: I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?\nViserys Targaryen: A pirate ship?\nDoreah: A dragon.\nViserys Targaryen: No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen : their skulls. They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep. When I was very young, just 3 or 4, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him. When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet. The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong. Skulls no bigger than dog skulls. But as you got closer to the Iron Throne... They got bigger and bigger and bigger. There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius, Archonel, Meraxes, Vhagar... And Balerion the Dread... whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one.\nDoreah: What happened to the skulls?\nViserys Targaryen: I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind.\nDoreah: That's very sad.\nViserys Targaryen: Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?\nDoreah: No, your Grace. To teach your sister.\nViserys Targaryen: To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nInside of the throne room at King s Landing.\n\nSepta Mordane: Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince...\nSansa Stark: What if I have a girl?\nSepta Mordane: Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.\nSansa Stark: What if I only have girls?\nSepta Mordane: I wouldn't worry about that.\nSansa Stark: Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls.\nSepta Mordane: Yes, but it's highly unlikely.\nSansa Stark: But what if?\nSepta Mordane: If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.\nSansa Stark: And everyone would hate me.\nSepta Mordane: Nobody could ever hate you.\nSansa Stark: Joffrey does.\nSepta Mordane: Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...\nSansa Stark: Please shut up about it.\nSepta Mordane: Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?\nSansa Stark: Aegon the Conqueror.\nSepta Mordane: And who built the Red Keep?\nSansa Stark: Maegor the Cruel.\nSepta Mordane: And how many years did it take to build...\nSansa Stark: My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?\nSepta Mordane: They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.\nSansa Stark: The Mad King.\nSepta Mordane: Commonly known as the Mad King.\nSansa Stark: Why were they killed?\nSepta Mordane: You should speak to your father about these matters.\nSansa Stark: I don't want to speak to my father, ever.\nSepta Mordane: You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.\nSansa Stark: No, I won't.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nSmall council meeting in King s Landing.\n\nJanos Slynt: It's the Hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords.\nEddard Stark: The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.\nJanos Slynt: Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.\nVarys: Dreadful.\nRenly Baratheon: If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.\nJanos Slynt: I need more men.\nEddard Stark:  You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.\nPetyr Baelish: I will?\nEddard Stark:  You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left.\nJanos Slynt: Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use.\nEddard Stark: The sooner this is over, the better.\nVarys: The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.\nPetyr Baelish: And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.\nEddard Stark: I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?\n\nEddard dismisses the council, as they are all leaving, Ned stops Pycelle.\n\nGrand Maester Pycelle: This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord.\nEddard Stark:  I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.\nEddard Stark:  Why?\nGrand Maester Pycelle: I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...\nEddard Stark:  What did Jon want the night before he died?\nGrand Maester Pycelle: He came inquiring after a book.\nEddard Stark:  A book? What book?\nGrand Maester Pycelle: I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome.\nEddard Stark: I'd like to read it.\n\nNow in Pycelle s room, he hands a book to Ned.\n\nGrand Maester Pycelle: \"The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.\"\nEddard Stark:  \"Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained\nin a bear hunt.\"\nGrand Maester Pycelle: As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read.\nEddard Stark:  Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?\nGrand Maester Pycelle: He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask.\nEddard Stark:  Jon's death...\nGrand Maester Pycelle: Such a tragedy.\nEddard Stark:  Did he say anything to you during his final hours?\nGrand Maester Pycelle:Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating: \"The seed is strong,\" I think it was.\nEddard Stark:  \"The seed is strong\"? What does that mean?\nGrand Maester Pycelle: The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.\nEddard Stark: And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?\nGrand Maester Pycelle: What else could it be?\nEddard Stark:  Poison.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...\nEddard Stark:  I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?\nEddard Stark:  Everybody knows that.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know.\nEddard Stark: I've taken enough of your time.\nGrand Maester Pycelle: No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor...\nEddard Stark:  Thank you. I'll find my own way out.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nNed is walking back to his chambers as he sees Arya balancing on one foot in front of a staircase.\n\nArya Stark: Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.\nEddard Stark:  It's a hard fall down these steps.\nArya Stark: Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.\nEddard Stark:  Cats? Syrio says \nArya Stark: He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.\nEddard Stark:  He's right about that.\nArya Stark: Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?\nEddard Stark: He needs to get his strength back first.\nArya Stark:He wants to be a knight of the King s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?\nEddard Stark: No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.\nArya Stark: Can I be Lord of a holdfast?\nEddard Stark: You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.\nArya Stark: No. That's not me.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nKeeping watch on the wall, Sam joins Jon as his watch partner.\n\nSamwell Tarly: Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well.\nJon Snow: Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.\nSamwell Tarly: No, that's all right. I'm fine.\nJon Snow: You're not. You're freezing.\nSamwell Tarly: I don't like high places.\nJon Snow:  You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?\nSamwell Tarly: On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. \"You're almost a man now,\" he said, \"but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,\" he said, \"then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more.\" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?\nJon Snow:  Yes, he is.\nSamwell Tarly: I'm not going to get any better, you know?\nJon Snow:  Well  You can't get any worse.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nWalking through the gardens of King s Landing.\n\nPetyr Baelish: I hear you're reading a boring book.\nEddard Stark: Pycelle talks too much.\nPetyr Baelish: He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.\nEddard Stark:  Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?\nPetyr Baelish: I promised Cat that I'd help you.\nEddard Stark:  Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.\nPetyr Baelish: A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?\nEddard Stark: Varys or the Queen?\nPetyr Baelish: No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?\nEddard Stark:  Yes.\nPetyr Baelish: The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel.\nEddard Stark:  Why?\nPetyr Baelish: I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.\nEddard Stark: Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.\nPetyr Baelish: Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nPreparing for the Hand of the King s tournament, Ser Hugh is pacing out steps on the joust.\n\nJory Cassel: Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!\nHugh of the Vale: As you can see, I'm busy.\nJory Cassel: I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard.\nHugh of the Vale: I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...\nJory Cassel: No \"ser.\" I'm not a knight.\nHugh of the Vale: I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nRiding on horseback through King s Landing, Ned and Jory arrive at the armorer.\n\nJory Cassel: He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see.\nEddard Stark:  A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.\nJory Cassel: You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where.\nEddard Stark: Let them look.\nTobho Mott: The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.\nEddard Stark:  What did Lord Arryn want?\nTobho Mott: He always came to see the boy.\nEddard Stark:  I'd like to see him as well.\nTobho Mott: As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.\nEddard Stark: This is fine work.\nGendry: It's not for sale.\nTobho Mott: Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet...\nGendry: I made it for me.\nTobho Mott: Forgive him, my Lord.\nEddard Stark: There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?\nGendry: He just asked me questions is all, my Lord.\nEddard Stark: What kind of questions?\nGendry: About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother.\nEddard Stark: Your mother?\nGendry: Who she was, what she looked like.\nEddard Stark: What did you tell him?\nGendry: She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.\nEddard Stark: Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.\nJory Cassel: Find anything?\nEddard Stark: King Robert's bastard son.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nJaime is standing guard outside of the king s chambers. You can hear King Robert with numerous girls inside his room.\n\nJory Cassel: This is for the King from Lord Stark.\nJaime Lannister: Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.\nJory Cassel: Three? Four?\nJaime Lannister:  He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.\nJory Cassel: Forgive me, my Lord...\nJaime Lannister: Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?\nJory Cassel: We've met before, you know.\nJaime Lannister:  Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.\nJory Cassel: The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.\nJaime Lannister: That's where you got your scar?\nJory Cassel: Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.\nJaime Lannister:  Vicious sons of whores.\nJory Cassel: They like their bloodshed.\nJaime Lannister: They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?\nJory Cassel: With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.\nJaime Lannister:  I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.\nJory Cassel: Theon? He's a good lad.\nJaime Lannister:  I doubt it.\nRobert Baratheon: I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.\nJory Cassel: Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.\nJaime Lannister: I don't serve Lord Stark.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn the mess hall at Castle Black.\n\nGrenn: Where have you been?\nJon Snow: Watch duty. With Sam.\nPyp: Prince Porkchop. Where is he?\nJon Snow: He wasn't hungry.\nPyp: Impossible!\nJon Snow: That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.\nRast: You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.\n\nAll of the new recruits are sleeping. Jon, Ghost (his direwolf), Pyp and Grenn ambush and gag Rast as he sleeps. Jon threatens him.\n\nJon Snow:  No one touches Sam.\n\nBack in the training yard the next morning. Rast is defying Alliser and not attacking Sam.\n\nAlliser Thorne: What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there.\nGrenn: Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield.\nAlliser Thorne: You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAfter their bath, Viserys drags Doreah by her hair through the camp and into Daenerys  tent.\n\nViserys Targaryen: You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!\nDoreah: Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked.\nDaenerys Targaryen: Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us.\nIrri: Yes, Khaleesi.\nDaenerys Targaryen: Why did you hit her?!\nViserys Targaryen: How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.\nDaenerys Targaryen: I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.\nViserys Targaryen: What's this?\nDaenerys Targaryen: It's a gift. I had it made for you.\nViserys Targaryen: Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?\nDaenerys Targaryen: Please.\nViserys Targaryen: This stinks of manure. All of it.\nDaenerys Targaryen: Stop - stop it.\nViserys Targaryen: You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair.\nDaenerys Targaryen: You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.\nViserys Targaryen: You do not talk back to me!\n\nViserys hit Daenerys, as he mounts her to keep hitting her, she fends him off with a chain.\n\nViserys Targaryen: You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...\nDaenerys Targaryen: I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nInside the Castle Black mess hall, cleaning up.\n\nSamwell Tarly: I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.\nJon Snow: I wouldn't doubt it.\nSamwell Tarly: Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?\nJon Snow:  Sally on the side?\nSamwell Tarly:It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.\nJon Snow: I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.\nSamwell Tarly:Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.\nJon Snow:  As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.\nSamwell Tarly: I find that hard to believe.\nJon Snow:  I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...\nSamwell Tarly:You didn't know where to put it?\nJon Snow:  I know where to put it.\nSamwell Tarly:Was she... Old and ugly?\nJon Snow:  Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.\nSamwell Tarly: What color hair?\nJon Snow: Red.\nSamwell Tarly: I like red hair. And her... Her...\nJon Snow:  You don't want to know.\nSamwell Tarly: That good?\nJon Snow: Better.\nSamwell Tarly: Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...\nJon Snow:  What's my name?\nSamwell Tarly: Jon Snow?\nJon Snow:  And why is my surname Snow?\nSamwell Tarly: Because... You're a bastard from the north.\nJon Snow: I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.\nSamwell Tarly: So... You didn't know where to put it?\nAlliser Thorne: Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys.\nSamwell Tarly: It is a bit nippy.\nAlliser Thorne: A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?\nJon Snow: I build my own fires.\nAlliser Thorne: That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nInside Daenerys  tent, speaking privately to Jorah.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen: I hit him. I hit the dragon.\nJorah Mormont: Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.\nDaenerys Targaryen: He is still the true King.\nJorah Mormont: The truth now: do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?\nDaenerys Targaryen: No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.\nJorah Mormont: The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play.\nDaenerys Targaryen:What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?\nJorah Mormont: Home.\nDaenerys Targaryen: I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAt the Hand of the King s tournament. Baelish sees Sansa looking at Joffrey who hides his face from her.\n\nPetyr Baelish: Lover's quarrel?\nSansa Stark: I'm sorry. Do I...?\nSepta Mordane: Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known...\nPetyr Baelish: An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.\nArya Stark: Why do they call you Littlefinger?\nSansa Stark: Arya!\nSepta Mordane: Don't be rude!\nPetyr Baelish: No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.\nRobert Baratheon: I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!\n\nThe competitors step forward on their horses, Baelish introduces them to Sansa.\n\nSansa Stark: Gods, who is that?\nPetyr Baelish: Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother.\nSansa Stark: And his opponent?\nPetyr Baelish: Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.\nRobert Baratheon: Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!\n\nThe joust begins. The first pass takes its course with no contact. On the second pass, the Mountain s joust strikes Ser Hugh in the neck, causing a massive splinter, and his blood gushing out. This occurs directly in front of where Sansa is sitting.\n\nPetyr Baelish: Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story.\nSansa Stark: I won't tell anyone. I promise.\nPetyr Baelish: No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIn Eddard s quarters, Cersei enters.\n\nJory Cassel: My Lord, Her Grace the Queen.\nEddard Stark: Your Grace.\nCersei Baratheon: You're missing your tournament.\nEddard Stark: Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.\nCersei Baratheon: I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us   the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?\nEddard Stark:  She likes it here.\nCersei Baratheon: The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her.\nEddard Stark: What are you doing here?\nCersei Baratheon:  I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?\nEddard Stark:  The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.\nCersei Baratheon: You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.\nEddard Stark:  If that's my job, then so be it.\nCersei Baratheon: You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.\nEddard Stark:  I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace.\nCersei Baratheon: As was I.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAt an inn along the King s Road. Catelyn is heading back towards Winterfell.\n\nMarillion: Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!\nCatelyn Stark: And to you.\nRodrick Cassel: Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly.\nMarillion: Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?\nRodrick Cassel: I'd rather throw myself down a well.\nMarillion: Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!\n\nTyrion and Yoren of the Night s Watch enter the inn. Catelyn attempts to hide herself.\n\nMasha Heddle: I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room.\nTyrion Lannister: My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room.\nMasha Heddle: Truly, my lord, we have nothing.\nTyrion Lannister: Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?\nBronn: You can have my room.\nTyrion Lannister: There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.\nYoren: Aye, my Lord.\nMarillion: My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!\nTyrion Lannister: Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.\nMasha Heddle: Lady Stark.\nCatelyn Stark: I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?\nKnight of House Whent: It is, my Lady.\nCatelyn Stark: And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?\nKnight of House Whent: She is.\nCatelyn Stark: The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.\nKnight of House Bracken: Our lord is honored by his trust.\nTyrion Lannister: I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.\nCatelyn Stark:Knight of House Frey: Lord Walder is well, my Lady. He has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday. He plans to take another wife.\nCatelyn Stark: This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice.\n\nAll of the knights draw their swords towards Tyrion.\n\n", "episode_59": "\n\nTITLE SEQUENCEEXT. MEEREEN - HARBORThe Masters  men are launching flaming projectiles at the Great Pyramid and surrounding city from their ships. DAENERYS watches from atop a balcony of the Great Pyramid. She returns to the interior, to the conference room where TYRION awaits. DAENERYS approaches him. An explosion occurs outside.\n\nTYRION: Despite appearances, I think you ll find the city s on the rise.\n\nAn explosion occurs outside.\n\nTYRION: Perhaps we should take shelter.\n\nAn explosion occurs outside.\n\nDAENERYS: The city is on the rise?\n\nTYRION: Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.\n\nAn explosion occurs outside.\n\nTYRION: Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters \n\nAn explosion occurs outside.\n\nTYRION: ...it proves that no one needs a Master.\n\nDAENERYS: Good. Shall we begin?\n\nTYRION: Do we have a plan?\n\nDAENERYS: I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan.\n\nTYRION tightens his jaw and looks away.\n\nDAENERYS: You don t approve?\n\nTYRION: You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?\n\nAn explosion occurs outside.\n\nTYRION: Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That s why Jaime killed him.\n\nDAENERYS: This is entirely different.\n\nTYRION: You re talking about destroying cities. It s not entirely different. I d like to suggest an alternate approach.\n\nA blast causes the window across the room to explode inward, sending shards of wood flying everywhere. DAENERYS and TYRION duck, then turn to look at the window.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN - PLATEAU\n\nDAENERYS, TYRION, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and an assembly of Unsullied stand across from the three Masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION, and a group of their soldiers.\n\nRAZDAL (to DAENERYS): Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.\n\nTYRION: We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.\n\nYEZZAN: The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.\n\nDAENERYS: We obviously didn t communicate clearly. We re here to discuss your surrender, not mine.\n\nRAZDAL: I imagine it s difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.\n\nDAENERYS: My reign has just begun.\n\nA dragon screeches in the distance. YEZZAN turns to look in the direction of the screech. DROGON flies up over the plateau and lands on an overlooking structure. He roars and drops down beside DAENERYS. DAENERYS climbs on his back and they fly off over Meereen. When they pass over the entrance to the catacombs, RHAEGAL and VISERION bust down the door with flame and take flight to join them. The ensemble flies over the beach entrance to Meereen.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN - BEACH ENTRANCE\n\nA group of the Sons of the Harpy are slaughtering citizens of Meereen. Galloping footsteps can be heard in the distance. One of the Sons of the Harpy turns to look in the direction of the sound. The Dothraki horde led by DAARIO rounds the bend of a nearby cliff, yelling war cries and charging full force towards the Sons of the Harpy on horseback. DAARIO beheads a Son of the Harpy.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN - HARBOR\n\nDAENERYS and the dragons fly over the Masters  ships. The soldiers on the ships stop what they re doing and stare up at the dragons. DAENERYS and DROGON come to a halt and hover in front of one of the ships.\n\nDAENERYS: Dracarys.\n\nThe dragons shoot stream of fire down at the the ship. The ship becomes engulfed in flame and the soldiers scream as they die. The ship incinerates and capsizes.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN - PLATEAU\n\nGREY WORM steps forward and addresses the Masters  soldiers.\n\nGREY WORM (speaking Valyrian): You men have a choice:\n\nThe Unsullied ready their spears. The Masters  soldiers ready their swords.\n\nGREY WORM: ...fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families.\n\nA dragon screeches in the distance. The Masters  soldiers lay down their arms and run away.\n\nTYRION: Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.\n\nMISSANDEI: Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.\n\nTYRION: It always seems a bit abstract, doesn t it, other people dying?\n\nRAZDAL grabs YEZZAN.\n\nRAZDAL: Him. He should die.\n\nBELICHO: Yes, him.\n\nTYRION looks at GREY WORM.\n\nRAZDAL: He s not one of us. He s an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us.\n\nGREY WORM approaches the YEZZAN and stares in his eyes.\n\nYEZZAN: Please.\n\nYEZZAN falls to his knees. GREY WORM unsheathes his dagger and slices RAZDAL and BELICHO s throats. He sheathes his dagger and steps back. TYRION approaches YEZZAN and puts his hand on his shoulder.\n\nTYRION: Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.\n\nTYRION pats YEZZAN on the shoulder. He, GREY WORM, and MISSANDEI walk away.\nEXT. WINTERFELL - OUTSKIRTSJON SNOW, SANSA, DAVOS, TORMUND, LYANNA MORMONT, and some Stark bannermen sit on horseback, waiting. RAMSAY, HARALD KARSTARK, SMALLJON UMBER, and a group of Bolton soldiers approach on horseback. They come to a halt in front of JON SNOW and compnay.\n\nJON SNOW: You don t have to be here.\n\nSANSA: Yes, I do.\n\nRAMSAY: My beloved wife. I ve missed you terribly.\n\nRAMSAY looks at JON SNOW.\n\nRAMSAY: Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night s Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don t have the men, you don t have the horses, and you don t have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There s no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I m a man of mercy.\n\nJON SNOW: You re right. There s no need for a battle. Thousands of men don t need to die. Only one of us. Let s end this the old way. You against me.\n\nRAMSAY chuckles.\n\nRAMSAY: I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you re the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don t know if I d beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?\n\nJON SNOW: Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn t fight for them?\n\nRAMSAY points at JON SNOW.\n\nRAMSAY: He s good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you re too proud to surrender?\n\nSANSA: How do we know you have him?\n\nRAMSAY nods to SMALLJON. SMALLJON pulls SHAGGYDOG s head out from a satchel and throws it on the ground.\n\nRAMSAY: Now, if you want to save  \n\nSANSA: You re going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well.\n\nSANSA turns her horse and rides away.\n\nRAMSAY (to JON SNOW): She s a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you re all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven t fed them for seven days. They re ravenous. I wonder which parts they ll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We ll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard.\n\nRAMSAY and company ride back towards Winterfell. JON SNOW looks down.\n\nCUT TO: STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT\n\nJON SNOW, DAVOS, TORMUND, and SANSA are standing around a planning table.\n\nJON SNOW: If he was smart, he d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.\n\nDAVOS: That s not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they ll stop fearing him. He can t have that. Fear is his power.\n\nJON SNOW: It s his weakness, too. His mean don t want to fight for him. They re forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...\n\nTORMUND: It s not his men that worry me. It s his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.\n\nTORMUND looks at DAVOS.\n\nTORMUND: You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.\n\nJON SNOW: We re digging trenches all along our flanks. They won t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.\n\nTORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW.\n\nJON SNOW: A pincer move.\n\nTORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW. JON SNOW and DAVOS look at each other briefly.\n\nJON SNOW: They won t be able to hit us from the sides.\n\nTORMUND: Good.\n\nDAVOS: It s crucial that we let them charge at us. They ve got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he ll pursue. Then we ll have him surrounded on three sides.\n\nTORMUND (to JON SNOW): Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?\n\nJON SNOW: No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.\n\nDAVOS: We should all get some sleep.\n\nTORMUND: Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow.\n\nDAVOS, TORMUND, and any remaining attendants exit. JON SNOW sits down at the head of the table.\n\nSANSA: So you ve met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans.\n\nJON SNOW: Aye, for what they re worth.\n\nSANSA: You ve known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don t know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?\n\nJON SNOW: You re right.\n\nSANSA: You think he s going to fall into your trap. He won t He s the one who lays traps.\n\nJON SNOW: He s overconfident.\n\nSANSA: He plays with people. He s far better at it than you. He s been doing it all his life.\n\nJON SNOW stands.\n\nJON SNOW: Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.\n\nSANSA: You don t know him.\n\nJON SNOW: All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?\n\nSANSA: We ll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay s claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won t live long.\n\nJON SNOW: We can t give up on our brother.\n\nSANSA: Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.\n\nJON SNOW: Of course he does. What should I do differently?\n\nSANSA: I don t know! I don t know anything about battles! Just don t do what he wants you to do.\n\nJON SNOW: Aye, that s good advice.\n\nSANSA: You think that s obvious?\n\nJON SNOW: Well, it is a bit obvious.\n\nSANSA: If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?\n\nJON SNOW: When will we have a larger force?! We ve pleaded with every house that ll have us! The Blackfish can t help us! We re lucky to have this many men!\n\nSANSA: It s not enough!\n\nJON SNOW: Now, it s not enough! It s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds.\n\nSANSA: If Ramsay wins, I m not going back there alive. Do you understand me?\n\nJON SNOW I won t ever let him touch you again. I ll protect you, I promise.\n\nSANSA: No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.\n\nSANSA exits. JON SNOW turns, looks at the table, and sighs.\n\nCUT TO: STARK ENCAMPMENT\n\nDAVOS and TORMUND are walking together through the encampment.\n\nDAVOS: You think there s hope?\n\nTORMUND: I ve never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they ve never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there s hope. You want to avenge your king, don t you?\n\nDAVOS: It wasn t the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.\n\nTORMUND: You saw these demons?\n\nDAVOS: What?\n\nThey stop walking. DAVOS looks at TORMUND.\n\nDAVOS: No, it s a manner of speaking. Not actual demons.\n\nTORMUND: Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn t have demons in his skull. He didn t torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you.\n\nDAVOS: Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.\n\nTORMUND: Jon Snow s not a king.\n\nDAVOS: No, he s not.\n\nTORMUND and DAVOS smile at each other.\n\nTORMUND: I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.\n\nDAVOS: No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle.\n\nTORMUND: So what do you do all night?\n\nDAVOS: I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.\n\nTORMUND laughs.\n\nTORMUND: Happy shitting.\n\nTORMUND walks away.\n\nCUT TO: STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE S TENT\n\nMELISANDRE is sitting at a desk with a mirror and candles on it, staring into a fire pit. JON SNOW enters and approaches her.\n\nJON SNOW: My lady. You weren t at the war council.\n\nMELISANDRE: I m not a soldier.\n\nJON SNOW: Any advice?\n\nMELISANDRE: Don t lose.\n\nJON SNOW: If I do, if I fall, don t bring me back.\n\nMELISANDRE: I ll have to try.\n\nJON SNOW: I m ordering you not to bring me back.\n\nMELISANDRE: I am not your servant, Jon Snow.\n\nJON SNOW: You re in my camp. I m the commander.\n\nMELISANDRE: I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.\n\nJON SNOW: How do you know what he commands?\n\nMELISANDRE: I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn t want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you.\n\nJON SNOW: Why?\n\nMELISANDRE: I don t know. Maybe you re only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.\n\nJON SNOW: What kind of god would do something like that?\n\nMELISANDRE: The one we ve got.\n\nJON SNOW stares into the fire pit and then exits.\n\nCUT TO: STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS\n\nDAVOS is walking alone through the snow. He happens upon a pile of wooden rubble and stops to inspect it. He sees a charred statuette of a stag in the wood and stops to pick it up. He looks back at the pile of wood. A horn blows in the distance. DAVOS looks in the direction of the horn, then hands his head.\nINT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOMDAENERYS is sitting on the throne. TYRION stands beside her. They are attending to THEON and YARA, who are standing on the steps in front of them.\n\nTYRION (to THEON): Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf s height thinks he s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf s height.  The height of nobility,   a man of your stature,   someone to look up to.  You re all making the same five or six jokes.\n\nTHEON: It was a long time ago.\n\nTYRION: It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.\n\nTHEON: I didn t murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.\n\nYARA: And he paid for them.\n\nTYRION: Doesn t seem like it. He s still alive. It was complicated for you, I m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don t we?\n\nDAENERYS: You ve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?\n\nTHEON: Not my claim. Hers.\n\nDAENERYS: And what s wrong with you?\n\nTHEON: I m not fit to rule.\n\nTYRION: We can agree upon that at least.\n\nDAENERYS: Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?\n\nYARA: No more than Westeros.\n\nDAENERYS smiles.\n\nTHEON: Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.\n\nDAENERYS: Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.\n\nYARA: You and I have that in common.\n\nDAENERYS: We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.\n\nDAENERYS turns to TYRION.\n\nDAENERYS: Will their ships be enough?\n\nTYRION: With the former Masters  fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.\n\nTHEON: There are and Euron is building more. He s going to offer them to you.\n\nDAENERYS: So why shouldn t I wait for him?\n\nTHEON: The Iron Fleet isn t all he s bringing. He also wants to give you --\n\nYARA: His big cock, I think he said. Euron s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won t get one without the other.\n\nDAENERYS: And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?\n\nYARA: I never demand, but I m up for anything, really.\n\nTHEON: He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.\n\nTYRION: The Seven Kingdoms.\n\nTHEON: All of them.\n\nDAENERYS: And you don t want the Seven Kingdoms?\n\nTHEON: Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.\n\nDAENERYS: And that s all?\n\nYARA: We d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don t think a woman s fit to rule.\n\nDAENERYS: Reasonable.\n\nTYRION: What if everyone starts demanding their independence?\n\nDAENERYS: She s not demanding, she s asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We re not going to do that. We re going to leave the world better than we found it.\n\nDAENERYS stands and approaches YARA.\n\nDAENERYS: You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.\n\nYARA: That s our way of life.\n\nDAENERYS: No more.\n\nYARA and THEON look at each other. THEON nods. YARA turns back to DAENERYS.\n\nYARA: No more.\n\nYARA extends her hand to DAENERYS. DAENERYS looks back at TYRION. TYRION makes a shaking motion with his hand. DAENERYS and YARA grab each other s arms.\nEXT. WINTERFELL - OUTSKIRTSThe Stark and Bolton armies sit across the battlefield from one another. DAVOS sits on horseback among the ranks of the Stark army. JON SNOW rides his own horse through the ranks, looking at the men. He rides up next to TORMUND and WUN WUN, at the front of the line. Across the battlefield, X-shaped pyres resembling the sigil of House Bolton are burning. Attached to each of them is the body of a flayed man, strapped upside down. RAMSAY rides through the ranks of the Bolton army on horseback with a rope in his hand. RAMSAY reaches the front of the line and dismounts. The rope is revealed to be tied around RICKON s hands. RAMSAY ushers RICKON a little further out past the front line and stares at JON SNOW across the field. He unsheathes a dagger and raises it in the air. JON SNOW dismounts and walks a few paces out into the field. RAMSAY lowers the dagger and cuts RICKON s bindings.\n\nRAMSAY: Do you like games, little man? Let s play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That s it. That s the game. Easy. Ready? Go.\n\nRICKON starts walking out into the field, then looks back at RAMSAY.\n\nRAMSAY: No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules.\n\nA soldier approaches and hands RAMSAY his bow. RICKON starts running across the field. RAMSAY draws an arrow from his quiver. JON SNOW jumps on his horse and begins galloping across the field towards RICKON. RAMSAY notches an arrow and fires. The arrow lands in the ground next to RICKON. RAMSAY fires another arrow. It lands on the ground next to RICKON. JON SNOW and RICKON are getting closer. JON SNOW extends his hand out to RICKON. RAMSAY shoots another arrow. It misses. JON SNOW and RICKON are feet away from each other. An arrow pierces through RICKON s chest from behind. RICKON falls to the ground. JON comes to a halt beside him and looks down at him. RICKON gasps and then dies. JON SNOW looks up at RAMSAY.\n\nTORMUND (to himself): Don t.\n\nRAMSAY smiles and gives his bow back to the soldier.\n\nDAVOS: Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!\n\nThe Bolton archers draw and loose a volley of arrows. JON SNOW ushers his horse into a gallop straight towards the Bolton army.\n\nDAVOS: Go! Go! Follow your commander!\n\nTORMUND: Run and fight!\n\nWUN WUN roars. The bulk of the Stark forces charge across the field towards the Boltons. JON SNOW continues to rush the Bolton forces alone. The Bolton arches released a volley of arrows, some of which land in the body of JON SNOW s horse, causing him and his horse to tumble to the ground.\n\nRAMSAY: Now.\n\nKARSTARK: Cavalry, charge!\n\nJON SNOW stands to face the Bolton cavalry, charging at him. He takes off his sword belt and draws his sword. The cavalry approaches. Just before it s upon him, the Stark forces rush past JON SNOW and collide with the Bolton charge. Men on both sides die in the frenzy. Bodies and weaponry fly everywhere. Archers on both sides of the battlefield nock arrows and draw their bows.\n\nDAVOS: We ll just kill our own men. Stand down.\n\nThe Stark arches do not fire.\n\nRAMSAY: Loose!\n\nThe Bolton archers fire. Their arrows rain down on Stark and Bolton men alike. In the fray, JON SNOW dodges several horses which gallop past him. One Bolton cavalryman charges with his horse, but JON SNOW cuts him down. JON SNOW rushes forward and kills a man on the ground, then slices the belly of a second man. A volley of arrows rains down around JON SNOW. He ducks. None of the arrows hit him. He returns to his feet and cuts down another man, dodges the strike of a passing Bolton cavalryman, and runs through another Bolton footsoldier. A Stark footsoldier helps him finish the Bolton man, and JON SNOW grabs him by the shirt.\n\nJON SNOW: Get word --\n\nThe Stark footsoldier is taken in the head by an arrow. JON SNOW stares down at the man and then flies into a rage, killing two more Bolton soldiers. A third man runs at him but is knocked down by a galloping horse. JON SNOW runs over to where he landed and stabs him several times. A horseman gallops at JON SNOW with his ax ready, but a passing Stark cavalryman spears him. Another Bolton footsoldier approaches JON SNOW, but JON SNOW cuts him down. The bodies are beginning to pile up on the battlefield. RAMSAY s archers loose several more volleys. JON SNOW goes into a frenzy, killing many Bolton men. The bodies have piled up high enough to create small mountains of bodies. Men continue to fight atop and around them.\n\nDAVOS: We may as well be taking shits back here.\n\nDAVOS dismounts his horse.\n\nDAVOS: Follow!\n\nDAVOS unsheathes his sword and charges across the field. The remainder of the Stark forces charge after him. On the other side of the battlefield, RAMSAY smiles and acknowledges SMALLJON.\n\nRAMSAY: It s time, go.\n\nSMALLJON brandishes his sword and walks back and forth in front of his men.\n\nSMALLJON: Who owns the North?\n\nALL: We do!\n\nSMALLJON: Who owns the North?\n\nALL: We do!\n\nSMALLJON: Show me!\n\nSMALLJON and his men cheer and charge across the battlefield. JON SNOW continues fighting, but is knocked to the ground by a Bolton footsoldier. TORMUND appears and stabs the footsoldier through the back, then helps JON SNOW to his feet.\n\nTORMUND: Hey!\n\n\nWUN WUN and the Wildlings charge up behind TORMUND and JON SNOW. SMALLJON and his men are charging from the other side. WUN WUN points at them and grunts. A force of Bolton men appear bearing tall shields and spears. They create a half-circle around JON SNOW, TORMUND, DAVOS, WUN WUN, and the entire Stark forces. The other half of the circle is blocked by the piles of bodies on the battlefield. The shield soldiers set their shields firmly in the dirt, then point their spears inward towards the Stark forces.\n\nMAN: Infantry, advance!\n\nThe shield soldiers grunt in unison, lift their shields, and move in towards the Stark forces. With each wave of movement, they stab more and more Stark soldiers with their spears. One Stark soldier tries to climb up over the piles of bodies but gets cut down by SMALLJON. SMALLJON and his men charge down over the bodies, taking the Stark forces from the rear.\n\nDAVOS: With me, lads! Break their line!\n\nWUN WUN rushes the shield wall and swipes at the spears. TORMUND jumps to the side of some spears and attacks a man behind the shield wall. Several other Stark men rush towards the shield wall. JON SNOW and other Stark soldiers defend against SMALLJON s men. Many soldiers die on both sides, and the bodies begin to pile up again. WUN WUN rips a man in half. TORMUND pulls a shieldbearer down and kills him, but gets sliced across the arm and is fored to fall back among the Stark ranks.\n\nMAN: Tormund!\n\nMAN #2: Get him back!\n\nThe shieldbearers advance, pushing the Stark forces further in on themselves. More Stark men die.\n\nTORMUND: Fuck this, come on!\n\nTORMUND leads the Wildlings back towards the piles of bodies. JON SNOW and SMALLJON spot each other, but before they can engage, the Wildling charge overtakes them. In the fray, JON SNOW is pushes to the bottom of several bodies and starts getting crushed. He struggles to get out, but can t get a hold. TORMUND faces off against SMALLJON. TORMUND punches SMALLJON in the face, and SMALLJON responds with an overhead swing of his sword. TORMUND blocks it. More and more bodies are piling on top of JON SNOW. He can see glimpses of clashes and flailing limbs above, but nothing else. He gasps for air. SMALLJON knocks TORMUND to the ground and punches him in the face multiple times. Men are dying all around JON SNOW as he is being trampled. JON SNOW grabs onto the clothes of a standing men and hoists himself up. He emerges in the center of a tightly packed group of his men and fills his lungs with air. He spots WUN WUN fighting off some shieldbearers. WUN WUN is stabbed in the side, grunts, and pulls the spear out. SMALLJON repeatedly headbutts TORMUND in the face. DAVOS and JON SNOW look at each other. A horn begins to sound in the distance. SMALLJON stops headbutting TORMUND. TORMUND seizes the opportunity and tears into the skin of SMALLJON s neck with his teeth, then draws a small knife and stabs SMALLJON repeatedly. RAMSAY looks in the direction of the sounding horn. A force of cavalry appears across the battlefield carrying flags bearing the white falcon sigil of House Arryn. SANSA and PETYR BAELISH sit on horseback beside the charging Arryn cavalry. TORMUND kills SMALLJON and screams. The Arryn cavalry takes the Bolton shieldbearers from the rear, then circles around and knocks them all down. SANSA smiles. JON SNOW climbs up to the top of the piles of bodies and spots RAMSAY on his horse. WUN WUN and TORMUND climb up beside JON SNOW. RAMSAY sees JON SNOW, turns his horse around, and rides back towards Winterfell. JON SNOW, TORMUND, and WUN WUN chase after him. SANSA watches them go.\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD\n\nRAMSAY and several Bolton soldiers enter the courtyard through Winterfell s main gate. Some men close and bar the gate behind them and they dismount.\n\nRAMSAY: Their army s gone.\n\nMAN: Our army s gone.\n\nRAMSAY: We have Winterfell. They don t have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.\n\nSomething thuds against the gate. RAMSAY turns to look at it. Several Bolton archers nock arrows. Several more thuds occur against the other side of the gate. WUN WUN busts a hole in the gate. BOLTON archers shoot arrows at his hand and down at his body over the side of the castle wall. WUN WUN roars and punches another hole in the gate. RAMSAY moves farther away from the gate s interior. WUN WUN reaches in and grabs the wooden bar holding the gate, but a Bolton soldier throws a spear through the back of his hand. WUN WUN rips his hand away and then bursts through the gate, opening it. He sprints into the courtyard, then falls to his knees. The Bolton archers continue shooting arrows into him. He roars. Stark soldiers flood the courtyard and beginning killing the Bolton soldiers, quickly overtaking them. JON SNOW enters the courtyard and runs up beside WUN WUN. They look at each other. TORMUND runs up beside WUN WUN, on his other side. JON SNOW reaches out to WUN WUN, but RAMSAY shoots WUN WUN in the eye with an arrow, killing him.\n\nRAMSAY (to JON SNOW): You suggested one on one combat, didn t you?\n\nStark archers aim their bows at RAMSAY.\n\nRAMSAY: I ve reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.\n\nRAMSAY notches an arrow. JON SNOW drops his sword and picks up a shield. RAMSAY aims at JON SNOW and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. RAMSAY nocks another arrow and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. RAMSAY nocks a third arrow and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. Before RAMSAY can nock a fourth arrow, JON SNOW overtakes him. JON SNOW bashes RAMSAY with his shield twice, knocking him over. JON SNOW drops his shield and jumps on top of RAMSAY, then punches him in the raise over and over. RAMSAY s faces becomes mangled and bleeds. SANSA enters the courtyard. JON SNOW sees her and stops punching RAMSAY. He stands and walks away. The Bolton flags fall away from the walls of Winterfell and are replaced by Stark flags. MELISANDRE watches from a balcony. DAVOS, holding the charred stag statuette, stares up at her. Some Stark men carry RICKON s body into the courtyard on a stretcher and stop in front of JON SNOW, TORMUND, and SANSA.\n\nJON SNOW: We re going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.\n\nThe stretcher men continue on. JON SNOW turns to walk away.\n\nSANSA: Jon.\n\nJON SNOW turns back to face SANSA.\n\nSANSA: Where is he?\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL - KENNELS\n\nRAMSAY is tied to a chair inside the kennel gates. He is mangled and bleeding. He groans and coughs, then raises his head to see SANSA standing outside the gate.\n\nRAMSAY: Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I ll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That s all right. You can t kill me. I m part of you now.\n\nSANSA: Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.\n\nThe dogs growl in their cells and begin filtering out into the kennel.\n\nRAMSAY: My hounds will never harm me.\n\nSANSA: You haven t fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.\n\nRAMSAY: They re loyal beasts.\n\nSANSA: They were. Now they re starving.\n\nThe dogs growl. One approaches RAMSAY from the front and puts its front paws up on his legs. It sniffs RAMSAY s face.\n\nRAMSAY: Sit. Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!\n\nThe dog bites RAMSAY s face. RAMSAY screams. The dogs converge on RAMSAY and begin tearing him apart. SANSA turns as though she might leave, but lingers for a moment to watch. SANSA turns and walks away, then smiles.\nCREDITS\n\n", "episode_58": "\n\nTITLE SEQUENCEEXT. SHEELBA SQUARE - STAGELADY CRANE and CLARENZO are performing JOFFREY s death scene in The Bloody Hand. Portraying CERSEI, LADY CRANE is kneeling, cradling CLARENZO s head. The audience watches silently.\n\nLADY CRANE: My son. My firstborn son. My child king, hush. Listen to the gods, for you they sing. Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won. The wolves are buried and the false stag done. Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven I ll see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life.\n\nThe crowd cheers. LADY CRANE and CLARENZO stand and bow. LADY CRANE makes her way backstage. She takes off her wig and sits down at her table in the actors  break room, wiping her eyes. She takes her bottle of rum and begins to pour herself a glass but stops when she hears a rustling from behind a clothing rack. She stands and walks over to the clothing rack, then parts the clothes. ARYA is lying on the ground behind the rack, bleeding from her stomach.\n\nCUT TO: BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE S APARTMENT\n\nARYA is lying in bed. LADY CRANE sits beside her, treating her wounds.\n\nARYA: You re good at that. Where did you learn?\n\nLADY CRANE: I m a jealous woman. I ve always liked bad men and they ve always liked me. They d come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore s perfume.\n\nLADY CRANE stands and carries her tray of medical supplies into the abutting room.\n\nLADY CRANE: So we d fight and I d put a hole in them. And then I d feel terrible, so I d patch them up. I got good at patching them up.\n\nARYA: And good at putting holes in them.\n\nLADY CRANE chuckles. ARYA smiles.\n\nLADY CRANE: And that.\n\nARYA: What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.\n\nLADY CRANE: Bianca.\n\nLADY CRANE spoons soup into a bowl and carries it back to ARYA.\n\nLADY CRANE: She ll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.\n\nLADY CRANE hands ARYA the bowl. ARYA takes it and slurps, then scrunches up her face.\n\nARYA: Mmm.\n\nLADY CRANE: I never did learn to cook. But eat. Eat. You need it. The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.\n\nARYA: I can t.\n\nLADY CRANE: Why not? Got a feeling you d be good at this sort of work. And besides, we need a new actress.\n\nARYA: I don t think I could remember all of the lines.\n\nLADY CRANE: Come with us. What s left for you here?\n\nARYA: You wouldn t be safe.

LADY CRANE touches her hand and dims the candlelight.\nEXT. RIVERLANDS - WOODSFour men are sitting around a small campfire, two young and two middle-aged. One of the middle-aged men is named GATINS.\n\nMAN: Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.\n\nGATINS: I was a famous kisser. You lads know how to kiss proper?\n\nThe young men look at each other.\n\nYOUNG MAN: Course we do.\n\nGATINS: This is for masters, this technique. You re not ready.\n\nYOUNG MAN #2: I m ready.\n\nMAN: He says he s ready.\n\nGATINS: All right.\n\nGATINS stands and walks over to YOUNG MAN #2. YOUNG MAN #2 stands.\n\nGATINS: Now, pay attention. You put your left hand on the back of the lady s head.\n\nGATINS puts his left hand on the back of YOUNG MAN #2 s head.\n\nGATINS: Your right hand holds the small of the lady s back like so.\n\nGATINS puts his right hand on the small of YOUNG MAN #2 s back.\n\nGATINS: Very romantic. Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole.\n\nGATINS shoves his hand down the back of YOUNG MAN #2 s pants. YOUNG MAN #2 flails and pulls away. The other middle-aged man bursts out laughing. GATINS smells his finger.\n\nMAN: So fucking close!\n\nGATINS: Ah, it smells like pussy to me.\n\nMAN: Look at him. You get hard, boy?\n\nYOUNG MAN #2: Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.\n\nGATINS sits back down next to the fire. YOUNG MAN #2 remains standing, fixing his pants. SANDOR appears, carrying an ax. He is walking towards YOUNG MAN #2. YOUNG MAN #2 has his back turned to him.\n\nYOUNG MAN #2: Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?\n\nThe other three men spot SANDOR coming. They stand. YOUNG MAN #2 turns around to see what s coming. SANDOR growls and decapitates him. SANDOR approaches the second young man and drives his ax into his chest. The middle-aged man approaches SANDOR from behind with a sword. SANDOR spins around and slices his throat open. SANDOR lunges at GATINS and drives his axe into his groin, then rips it away. Blood spills out and GATINS falls to his knees, whimpering. SANDOR puts his hand on GATINS  head, forcing him to look up.\n\nSANDOR: Where s the other one? The one with the yellow cloak.\n\nGATINS: Fuck you!\n\nSANDOR: Those are your last words, fuck you? Come on, you can do better.\n\nGATINS: Cunt!\n\nSANDOR: You re shit at dying, you know that?\n\nSANDOR raises the ax above his head, growls, and buries it into GATINS.\nEXT. MEEREEN - MARKETPLACEThe courtyard is filled with people of all types. People are buying, selling, and renovating. In one area, a red priestess is preaching to a crowd.\n\nRED PRIESTESS (speaking Valyrian): From the fire she was reborn to remake the world. Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light to her children. If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors, no man will ever lock us in chains again.\n\nTYRION and VARYS enter, walking together through the courtyard. TYRION smiles.\n\nTYRION: I d call that a successful gambit.\n\nVARYS: Would you?\n\nTYRION: Look around. The city has come back to life.\n\nVARYS: You made a pact with fanatics.\n\nTYRION: I did and it worked.\n\nVARYS: If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you d say the razor worked. That doesn t mean it won t cut your throat.\n\nTYRION: Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.\n\nTYRION and VARYS stop walking and stare out through an archway at the harbor.\n\nTYRION: I m going to miss you.\n\nVARYS: I know.\n\nTYRION: I hope you re right about this expedition of yours.\n\nVARYS: If I don t return, you ll know I was wrong.\n\nTYRION broods. VARYS looks at him.\n\nVARYS:We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.\n\nTYRION: Most of all, we need our queen.\n\nVARYS: She ll come back. She has to. My heart s been broken too many times already.\n\nVARYS pats TYRION on the shoulder.\n\nVARYS: I ll walk the rest of the way myself. I can t go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.\n\nTYRION smiles. VARYS walks on.\n\nTYRION: Varys.\n\nVARYS turns back and looks at TYRION.\n\nTYRION: The most famous dwarf in the world.\n\nVARYS smiles and nods, then walks out into the harbor. TYRION walks back through the courtyard.\nINT. RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBERCERSEI is sitting at a table, drinking. There is a knock on the door. QYBURN enters. GREGOR is standing out in the hall.\n\nQYBURN: Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.\n\nCERSEI: Have been permitted? That s rather a tortured way of putting it.\n\nQYBURN: They demand to see you, Your Grace.\n\nCERSEI: Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?\n\nQYBURN says nothing.\n\nCERSEI: The king is aware of their presence?\n\nQYBURN: He is, Your Grace. He s currently in his chambers at prayer.\n\nCERSEI stands and walks past QYBURN out into the hall. QYBURN bows to her as she passes, then follows her out with GREGOR in tow. At the bottom of the steps, LANCEL and a group of Faith Militant are waiting. CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR approach them. One of the Faith Militant stares up at GREGOR.\n\nLANCEL: Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor.\n\nCERSEI: His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.\n\nLANCEL: Your Grace, this is not a request.\n\nCERSEI: It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I m refusing.\n\nLANCEL: The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?\n\nCERSEI: He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.\n\nLANCEL: He made no such promises. If you refuse to come of your own free will- -\n\nCERSEI: Get out.\n\nLANCEL nods at the Faith Militant. Two of them advance with spikes clubs. GREGOR steps in front of CERSEI.\n\nLANCEL (to GREGOR): Move aside, ser.\n\nGREGOR silently stares out from behind his helmet.\n\nLANCEL (to CERSEI): Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.\n\nCERSEI: I choose violence.\n\nOne of the Faith Militant swings his club into GREGOR s chestplate. GREGOR is unaffected. The club is stuck in the metal of the armor and the Faith Militant man struggles to wrench it free. He pulls it loose and reels back for another swing, but GREGOR takes him by the throat with one hand and lifts him up off the ground. LANCEL and the other Faith Militant regroup in the courtyard. The man in GREGOR s grasp gasps and drops his club. GREGOR tosses him out into the courtyard, then follows him out. GREGOR kneels over the man, grabs him by the jaw, and rips his head off. LANCEL looks around at the other Faith Militant. CERSEI smiles.\n\nCERSEI: Please tell His High Holiness he s always welcome to visit.\n\nCERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR turn to walk back up the steps.\nEXT. RIVERRUNBRIENNE and PODRICK arrive on horseback. They stare out at the Lannister/Frey encampment from an overlooking hill.\n\nPODRICK: Looks like a siege, my lady.\n\nBRIENNE: You have a keen military mind, Pod.\n\nBRIENNE spots JAIME riding a white horse among his men.\n\nPODRICK: My lady. My lady.\n\nSeveral Lannister soldiers ride towards BRIENNE and PODRICK, and then encircle them.\n\nMAN: Who goes there? State your business!\n\nBRIENNE: My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I ve come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.\n\nCUT TO: RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT\n\nPODRICK watches Lannister soldiers riding through the encampment. His is choked from behind by an unknown man who reveals himself to be BRONN.\n\nBRONN: Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren t we?\n\nBRONN releases PODRICK. PODRICK coughs. BRONN laughs and slaps PODRICK on the shoulder.\n\nBRONN: Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you d be dead by now.\n\nPODRICK: Not yet.\n\nBRONN laughs and motions to a nearby tent.\n\nBRONN: Are they in there?\n\nPODRICK: Mm-hmm.\n\nBRONN: You think they re fucking?\n\nPODRICK: What? No.\n\nBRONN: Why not? I d fuck her. You d fuck her, wouldn t you?\n\nPODRICK: I m her squire.\n\nBRONN: Oh. Well, he d fuck her, that s for sure. And she s fuck him, don t you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you re the one with the magic cock.\n\nBRONN grabs PODRICK s crotch.\n\nBRONN: You must have shown it to her by now.\n\nPODRICK: She s training me to fight.\n\nBRONN: Is she? Oh.\n\nPODRICK: An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day.\n\nBRONN: Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?\n\nPODRICK: Well, that s a different sort of fighting.\n\nBRONN: Now, that s the truth, isn t it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?\n\nPODRICK smiles and nods.\n\nBRONN: All right, let s start with your footwork.\n\nBRONN stands across from PODRICK.\n\nBRONN: Show me your stance.\n\nPODRICK postures up.\n\nBRONN: Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?\n\nPODRICK looks down at his feet. BRONN slaps him across the face.\n\nBRONN: Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you.  Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don t sulk.\n\nCUT TO: JAIME S TENT\n\nBRIENNE and JAIME stand across from each other.\n\nJAIME: I never thought you d find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.\n\nBRIENNE: Why would you assume that?\n\nJAIME: In my experience, girls like her don t live very long.\n\nBRIENNE: I don t think you know many girls like her.\n\nJAIME: Well, I m proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds.\n\nJAIME walks around the room and comes to a stop on BRIENNE s other side. BRIENNE turns to face him.\n\nJAIME: Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey s murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?\n\nBRIENNE: I ve come for the Blackfish.\n\nJAIME: You re welcome to have him.\n\nBRIENNE: Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.\n\nJAIME: With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?\n\nBRIENNE: The Tully army.\n\nJAIME: They re a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum.\n\nBRIENNE: The Tullys are rebels because they re fighting for their home?\n\nJAIME: Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.\n\nBRIENNE: As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.\n\nJAIME: Exactly.\n\nJAIME and BRIENNE stare at each other.\n\nJAIME: We shouldn t argue about politics.\n\nBRIENNE: You re a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I ve seen it myself.\n\nJAIME: I m a Lannister. Don t ask me to betray my own house.\n\nBRIENNE: I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.\n\nJAIME: What do you propose?\n\nBRIENNE: Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.\n\nJAIME: Why would he abandon his ancestral home?\n\nBRIENNE: Because you ll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.\n\nJAIME: Have you ever met the Blackfish?\n\nBRIENNE: No.\n\nJAIME: He s even more stubborn than you are.\n\nBRIENNE looks down. JAIME walks back around the table to BRIENNE s other side.\n\nJAIME: All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won t listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else s home.\n\nBRIENNE: I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you ll grant us safe passage north.\n\nJAIME: You have my word. You have until nightfall.\n\nBRIENNE nods and undoes her sword belt. She hands Oathkeeper to JAIME. JAIME sighs.\n\nBRIENNE: You gave it to me for a purpose. I ve achieved that purpose.\n\nJAIME: It s yours. It will always be yours.\n\nBRIENNE stares into JAIME s eyes, then ties Oathkeeper back on her waist and begins to walk out. JAIME follows her to the entrance of the tent. BRIENNE turns back.\n\nBRIENNE: one last thing, Ser Jaime.\n\nJAIME: Yes, Lady Brienne?\n\nBRIENNE: Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa s kin.\n\nJAIME: Of course it does.\n\nBRIENNE: To fight you.\n\nJAIME: Let s hope it doesn t come to that.\n\nBRIENNE and JAIME stare into each other s eyes. BRIENNE exits. JAIME watches her go.\n\nCUT TO: RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL\n\nBRIENNE and PODRICK follow BRYNDEN holding a piece of parchment as he walks along the walls of Riverrun.\n\nBRYNDEN: I ve said no three times already.\n\nBRIENNE: I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.\n\nBRYNDEN: I haven t seen her since she was a child. I don t know her signature. I don t know you. And I will not surrender.\n\nBRYNDEN turns to one of his soldiers.\n\nBRYNDEN: Double the guards tonight.\n\nBRYNDEN looks out at the Lannister/Frey encampment.\n\nBRYNDEL The Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it.\n\nBRYNDEN turns on his heel and walks inside. BRIENNE and PODRICK follow him.\n\nBRIENNE: As I have said, my name is- -\n\nBRYNDEN: Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man.\n\nBRIENNE: He always spoke highly of you.\n\nBRYNDEN: And if he were here now, I d tell him the same I m telling you.\n\nBRYNDEN makes his way down a set of steps.\n\nBRYNDEN: If you think I m abandoning my family s seat on the Kingslayer s word of honor, you re a bloody fool.\n\nBRIENNE: Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.\n\nBRYNDEN: We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.\n\nBRYNDEN, BRIENNE, and PODRICK emerge into Riverrun s main courtyard.\n\nBRIENNE: He s not my friend.\n\nBRYNDEN: No?\n\nBRYNDEN stops and turns back to face BRIENNE.\n\nBRYNDEN: Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?\n\nBRIENNE: Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die.\n\nBRIENNE holds out the piece of parchment to BRYNDEN. BRYNDEN takes it, unfolds it, and reads its contents. He smiles and chuckles under his breath.\n\nBRYNDEN: She s exactly like her mother.\n\nBRIENNE smiles. BRYNDEN turns back to face her.\n\nBRYNDEN: I don t have enough men to help her take Winterfell.\n\nBRIENNE: You have more than she does.\n\nBRYNDEN: She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does.\n\nBRYNDEN hands the letter back to BRIENNE. She takes it. BRYNDEN walks away.\n\nBRIENNE (to PODRICK): Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.\n\nPODRICK: What should I write?\n\nBRIENNE: Tell her I failed.\nINT. RED KEEP - THRONE ROOMA crowd of nobles fills the throne room. CERSEI enters, followed by QYBURN and GREGOR. The crowd stares at them and parts to let them pass. They approach the throne. TOMMEN, KEVAN, and MAESTER PYCELLE stand atop the steps to the throne. KEVAN walks down the steps and confronts CERSEI.\n\nCERSEI: There s to be a royal announcement?\n\nKEVAN: There is.\n\nCERSEI: Why wasn t I informed?\n\nKEVAN: There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.\n\nCERSEi starts up the steps but KEVAN blocks her with his arm.\n\nKEVAN: Where are you going?\n\nCERSEI: To stand by my son.\n\nKEVAN: Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.\n\nCERSEI stares at TOMMEN. TOMMEN looks away. MAESTER PYCELLE whispers to him. CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR move to one of the nearby balconies. TOMMEN sits on the Iron Throne and addresses the crowd.\n\nTOMMEN: Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister s trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.\n\nMembers of the crowd murmur to one another.\n\nTOMMEN: Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all.\n\nCROWD: Seven blessings.\n\nTOMMEN stands and makes his way out of the hall, accompanied by the goldcloaks. CERSEI watches him leave. QYBURN walks up beside CERSEi and whispers to her.\n\nQYBURN: Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.\n\nCERSEI: And? Was it just a rumor or something more?\n\nQYBURN: More. Much more.\nINT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOMTYRION pours himself a glass of wine. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI sit across from him.\n\nMISSANDEI: You seem happy.\n\nTYRION: I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.\n\nTYRION puts down his glass of wine on a table and pours another glass of wine.\n\nTYRION: Now it s like a man reborn.\n\nMISSANDEI: I will be happy when our queen returns.\n\nTYRION: Why don t you drink? Why don t either of you ever drink?\n\nTYRION pours a third glass of wine.\n\nGREY WORM: Unsullied never drink.\n\nTYRION: Why not?\n\nGREY WORM: Rules.\n\nTYRION: And who made these rules? Your former masters?\n\nGREY WORM and MISSANDEI look at each other.\n\nTYRION: Those miserable old shits didn t want you to be human. Have a drink with me.\n\nTYRION hands GREY WORM one of the glasses of wine. GREY WORM takes it.\n\nTYRION (to MISSANDEI): And you? What s your excuse?\n\nGREY WORM sniffs his glass of wine and scrunches up his face. TYRION hands MISSANDEI the second glass of wine. She takes it.\n\nMISSANDEI: I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.\n\nTYRION: That s how you know it s working.\n\nTYRION returns to his glass of wine and raises it up.\n\nTYRION: Here s to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.\n\nGREY WORM and MISSANDEI raise their glasses.\n\nTYRION: To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign.\n\nGREY WORM & MISSANDEI: Long may she reign.\n\nGREY WORM and MISSANDEI sip from their glasses. TYRION drinks all of his.\n\nTYRION: Do you like it?\n\nGREY WORM: Tastes like it has turned.\n\nTYRION walks to another decanter on the opposite side of the room and pours himself another glass of wine.\n\nTYRION: Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I d like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.\n\nTYRION sips his wine.\n\nTYRION: Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.\n\nTYRION walks back in front of GREY WORM and MISSANDEI.\n\nMISSANDEI: I do not know any jokes.\n\nTYRION: Grey worm?\n\nGREY WORM stares and says nothing.\n\nTYRION: Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale...\n\nMISSANDEI sips her wine.\n\nTYRION: ...but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts,  Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out. \n\nGREY WORM and MISSANDEI do not laugh.\n\nTYRION: It s funnier in Westeros.\n\nGREY WORM: The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies.\n\nTYRION: Yes.\n\nMISSANDEI: A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily.\n\nTYRION: A story that s supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps.\n\nMISSANDEI sips her wine again.\n\nTYRION: Missandei, do you like the wine?\n\nMISSANDEI: I do.\n\nTYRION: Tell a joke.\n\nMISSANDEI: Two translators are on a sinking ship.\n\nTYRION smiles.\n\nMISSANDEI: The first says,  Do you know how to swim?  The second says,  No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages. \n\nThere is a pause.\n\nTYRION Ah!\n\nTYRION begins to laugh. MISSANDEI smiles and sips her wine.\n\nGREY WORM: That is the worst joke I ever heard.\n\nMISSANDEI: You don t even know what a joke is.\n\nGREY WORM: I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?\n\nTYRION: You lied to us.\n\nGREY WORM: I make joke.\n\nMISSANDEI and TYRION laugh. GREY WORM smiles.\n\nMISSANDEI: More jokes.\n\nTYRION: I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -\n\nBells begin to ring. GREY WORM stands and runs out of the room, shouting in Valyrian.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE\n\nA fleet of white-sailed ships approaches Meereen. TYRION and MISSANDEI stare at at the ships.\n\nMISSANDEI: The Masters have come for their property.\nEXT. RIVERRUN - LANNISTER/FREY ENCAMPMENTJAIME rides horseback through the encampment, approaches a tent, dismounts, and enters.\n\nJAIME: Lord Edmure.\n\nEDMURE s hands are behind his back, his wrists bound around a vertical pole in the center of the tent. He is kneeling.\n\nJAIME: I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you ll be properly fed and clothes from now on.\n\nEDMURE stands.\n\nEDMURE: I have your word?\n\nEDMURE scoffs.\n\nEDMURE: Oh, good. Good, that s- - that s a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you re playing.\n\nJAIME: The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I ve heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You re a potent man.\n\nEDMURE: A son I ve never met born of a wife that I haven t seen since our first night together.\n\nJAIME: You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he ll have a keep of his own.\n\nEDMURE: Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you ve massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.\n\nJAIME: I ll remind you that our houses are at war. I m sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.\n\nEDMURE: Says the man who shoved his sword through his king s back.\n\nJAIME: Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It s not.\n\nJAIME sits on a barrel in the corner of the room.\n\nEDMURE: You understand. On some level you understand that you re an evil man.\n\nJAIME: I ll leave the judgments to the gods.\n\nEDMURE: Well, that is convenient for you. You re a fine-looking fellow, aren t you?\n\nEDMURE chuckles.\n\nEDMURE: Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we re decent, don t we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you re decent after everything that you ve done?\n\nJAIME: I was your sister s prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.\n\nEDMURE laughs.\n\nEDMURE: Yeah. She should have killed you.\n\nJAIME: Perhaps, but she didn t. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn t hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son.\n\nEDMURE: Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don t?\n\nJAIME: No, I don t, but I m telling you anyway because you re my prisoner. You don t have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister.\n\nEDMURE: Oh. Oh, I see. You re a madman.\n\nJAIME: I m not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -\n\nEDMURE: Don t talk about Cat!\n\nJAIME: I ll talk about whomever I want.\n\nEDMURE grunts and struggles against his bindings.\n\nJAIME: She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there s a fierceness you don t often see.\n\nJAIME stands and walks closer to EDMURE.\n\nJAIME: They d do anything to protect their babies.\n\nJAIME gets in EDMURE s face.\n\nJAIME: Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.\n\nEDMURE: You didn t come here to talk about our sisters.\n\nJAIME: That s exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn t matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I ll send for your baby boy.\n\nEDMURE struggles against his bindings, pushing himself towards JAIME.\n\nJAIME: And I ll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don t matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn t matter to me. The people in the castle don t matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that s what I ll do.\n\nCUT TO: RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL\n\nEDMURE crosses the bridge over Riverrun s moat, carrying a torch. Several guards point crossbows down at him. He stops at the end of the bridge.\n\nGUARD CAPTAIN: Who goes there?\n\nEDMURE: Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry.\n\nBRYNDEN appears on the wall with the guards.\n\nBRYNDEN: Don t let him in.\n\nGUARD CAPTAIN: He s the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.\n\nBRYNDEN: He s been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it s a trap, you idiot. Don t let him in.\n\nBRYNDEN turns to walk away.\n\nGUARD CAPTAIN: He s my lord, my lord. I ve sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands.\n\nBRYNDEN turns back.\n\nBRYNDEN: You re not obeying Edmure s commands. You re obeying the fucking Kinglsayer s commands.\n\nEDMURE (O.S.): I demand entry.\n\nGUARD CAPTAIN: My lord has given an order.\n\nBRYNDEN: WIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order.\n\nThe guard captain turns to his fellow guards.\n\nGUARD CAPTAIN: Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed- -\n\nBRYNDEN unsheathes his sword halfway. The guard captain and the other guards show their steel.\n\nBRYNDEN: I ll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.\n\nGUARD CAPTAIN: You are not lord of this castle, my lord.\n\nBRYNDEN looks around at the other guards, sheathes his sword, and walks away.\n\nGUARD CAPTAIN: Lower the drawbridge!\n\nGUARD: Aye, ser!\n\nThe drawbridge begins to open. EDMURE stares back across the Lannister/Frey encampment. JAIME waits on his horse. BLACK WALDER rides up beside JAIME. The drawbridge fully extends. EDMURE walks inside.\n\nBLACK WALDER (to JAIME): If you re wrong, we re just surrendered our most valuable prisoner.\n\nThe drawbridge closes behind EDMURE. Riverrun soldiers are gathered to meet him. BRYNDEN appears in the rear of their ranks. EDMURE spots BRYNDEN, hands his torch to one of the soldiers, and walks up the stairs to the top of the outer wall.\n\nGUARD CAPTAIN: Welcome home, my lord.\n\nEDMURE: Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms. Open the gates.\n\nGUARD CAPTAIN: My lord- -\n\nEDMURE: Your lord has given a command.\n\nThe drawbridge opens. JAIME glances at BLACK WALDER and rides towards Riverrun. The Lannister and Frey forces follow him into Riverrun.\n\nEDMURE: Find the Blackfish. Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.\n\nGUARD CAPTAIN (to a guard): Find him.\n\nThe Riverrun soldiers lay down their arms in a pile as the Lannister forces enter the castle.\n\nCUT TO: RIVERRUN - RIVER EXIT\n\nBRYNDEN, PODRICK, and BRIENNE emerge from a doorway. BRYNDEN places the torch in a sconce and stands in the doorway. PODRICK gets onto a small rowboat floating on the surface of the river. BRIENNE kneels to steady the rowboat for PODRICK, then turns back to look at BRYNDEN.\n\nBRYNDEN: Go on.\n\nBRYNDEN stands and faces him.\n\nBRIENNE: Come with us.\n\nBRYNDEN: I ve run before from the Red Wedding. I m not running again. This is my family home.\n\nBRIENNE: Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don t die for pride when you can fight for your blood.\n\nBRYNDEN: You ll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.\n\nSome guards begin shouting in the background.\n\nBRYNDEN: Go on, now.\n\nBRYNDEN unsheathes his sword.\n\nBRYNDEN: I haven t had a proper sword fight in years. I expect I ll make a damn fool of myself.\n\nBRYNDEN heads through the doorway and back up the steps. BRIENNE watches him leave and then gets on the rowboat.\n\nCUT TO: RIVERRUN - COURTYARD\n\nLannister and Frey banners are being draped all over the courtyard. Lannister soldiers walk over the fallen Tully banners.\n\nCUT TO: RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL\n\nJAIME stands atop the outer wall. A Lannister guard enters and approaches him.\n\nGUARD: We found the Blackfish, my lord.\n\nJAIME: Good. Bring him to me.\n\nGUARD: He died fighting, my lord.\n\nJAIME nods to the guard. The guard exits. JAIME stares out at the river and sees BRIENNE and PODRICK rowing away from Riverrun. He looks around to see if anyone else is watching. BRIENNE looks over her shoulder and sees JAIME standing atop the wall. JAIME waves to her. BRIENNE waves back.\nEXT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINEThe Masters  fleet is launching flaming projectiles at Meereen and the Great Pyramid, setting them ablaze.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM\n\nTYRION and MISSANDEI enter. GREY WORM is waiting for them. Many Unsullied stand guard around the room.\n\nTYRION: I was wrong. I admit it.\n\nMISSANDEI: That changes nothing.\n\nTYRION: The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers  forces- -\n\nGREY WORM: No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.\n\nTYRION: And I have acknowledged that. I m trying- -\n\nGREY WORM: You re trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.\n\nTYRION: All right, what should the army do?\n\nGREY WORM: We ll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here.\n\nTYRION: And then?\n\nGREY WORM: We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.\n\nSomething thuds and rattles the roof of the pyramid. Footsteps can be heard. Everyone looks up. MISSANDEI grabs a knife from a table and stands beside TYRION. GREY WORM and the Unsullied form up in front of the door to the balcony. One Unsullied opens the door. Another inches out through it, shield and spear in hand. The Unsullied man looks side to side and sees nothing, but then sees something and kneels. The rest of the Unsullied follow suit. DAENERYS enters. A dragon screeches and flies away in the background.\nEXT. RIVERLANDS - WOODSSANDOR walks along the center of a path through the woods, carrying an ax and a satchel. He hears horses whinnying and the voices of men. He follows the sounds and happens upon BERIC DONDARRION, THOROS OF MYR, and other members of the Brotherhood Without Banners. They are preparing to hang LEM and two of his accomplices, who stand on blocks ith nooses tied around their necks. BERIC turns to see SANDOR. Some of the Brotherhood members brandish weapons.\n\nBERIC: Clegane.\n\nTHOROS: What the fuck you doing here?\n\nSANDOR: Chasing them. You?\n\nTHOROS: Hanging them.\n\nSANDOR: Any particular reason?\n\nBERIC: They re our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?\n\nSANDOR: Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.\n\nTHOROS: You ve got friends?\n\nSANDOR: Not anymore. They re mine.\n\nSANDOR advances. BERIC and another member of the Brotherhood block his path.\n\nBERIC: It s the Brotherhood s good name they ve dragged through the dirt.\n\nSANDOR: Fuck your name. They re mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again.\n\nOne of the Brotherhood members notches an arrow and points his bow at SANDOR.\n\nSANDOR: Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.\n\nSANDOR points his ax at the man but keeps his eyes locked on BERIC.\n\nSANDOR: Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.\n\nSANDOR walks towards the bowman.\n\nBERIC: You can have one of them.\n\nSANDOR turns back to face BERIC, glances at the men about to be hanged, then looks back at BERIC.\n\nSANDOR: Two.\n\nBERIC looks at THOROS. THOROS nods. BERIC nods to SANDOR. SANDOR approaches one of the men and raises his ax above his head to swing. THOROS catches the ax s handle from behind.\n\nTHOROS: No, no, no.\n\nSANDOR turns to face THOROS and tries to wrench his ax free.\n\nTHOROS: We re not butchers. We hang them.\n\nTHOROS releases SANDOR s ax.\n\nSANDOR: hanging? All over in an instant. Where s the punishment in that?\n\nTHOROS: They die.\n\nSANDOR: We all bloody die.\n\nSANDOR gestures to BERIC.\n\nSANDOR: Except this one here. I ll only gut one of them.\n\nBERIC: No.\n\nSANDOR: I ll chop off one hand.\n\nBERIC: We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That s generous.\n\nSANDOR: Bunch of nancies.\n\nSANDOR throws down his ax.\n\nSANDOR: There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.\n\nTHOROS: You re getting old, Clegane.\n\nSANDOR: He s not.\n\nSANDOR kicks the box out from underneath one of the men, hanging him. He moves in front of LEM.\n\nLEM: Please don t. I ll give you anything.\n\nSANDOR kicks the box out from underneath LEM, hanging him. LEM gasps for air. BERIC hangs the third man. SANDOR pulls the boot off of LEM s foot. BERIC and THOROS begin to walk away, but turn back to look at SANDOR. SANDOR takes off his own boot and sizes up LEM s boot to his own foot. He shoves his foot into LEM s boot and looks up at BERIC and THOROS.\n\nSANDOR: Got anything to eat?\n\nCUT TO: RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS  ENCAMPMENT\n\nSeveral members of the Brotherhood are sitting around small campfires. SANDOR, BERIC, and some other Brothers are sitting at one such campfire. SANDOR is eating a piece of meat. THOROS approaches and sits beside them.\n\nTHOROS (to SANDOR): Enjoying yourself?\n\nSANDOR: I prefer chicken.\n\nTHOROS hands SANDOR a water skin. SANDOR drinks from it.\n\nBERIC: You ought to join us. We could use you.\n\nSANDOR: I tried joining. Didn t work out for me.\n\nTHOROS: Clegane, we re here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves.\n\nSANDOR: Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.\n\nSANDOR returns the water skin to THOROS, stands, walks to the river, and urinates into it.\n\nBERIC: Cold winds are rising in the North.\n\nSANDOR: And you re going to go stop them?\n\nBERIC: We need good men to help us.\n\nSANDOR: Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me.\n\nBERIC: True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?\n\nSANDOR laughs.\n\nSANDOR: I beat you because I m better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I m better than you now.\n\nSANDOR returns to his spot by the campfire and sits.\n\nBERIC: Aye, you re probably right. You re a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we re fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you ve harmed Clegane, it s not too late for you.\nINT. BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE S APARTMENTARYA is sleeping. LADY CRANE enters the bedroom, sits down beside ARYA, and strokes her face. ARYA stirs and groans. LADY CRANE stands and walks back into the abutting room. She retrieves a stool and stands atop it, reaching for a bottle on top of a bureau. She turns around and sees a young man with blonde hair. Cut to ARYA s perspective. There is a thud. ARYA awakens with a gasp and looks around. She sees a shadow moving in the abutting room.\n\nARYA: Lady Crane?\n\nARYA gets out of bed and winces. She walks towards the abutting room.\n\nARYA: Lady Crane?\n\nARYA enters the abutting room and sees LADY CRANE lying crumpled on top of the stool, dead. Blood is pooled on the ground beneath her.\n\nWAIF: If you d have done your job, she would have died painlessly.\n\nARYA turns to see the WAIF standing in the doorway with a knife. The WAIF approaches ARYA slowly and ARYA backs away, matching her pace.\n\nWAIF: Instead \n\nThe WAIF holds out her arms.\n\nWAIF: The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can t change that. I can t change that. No one can. And now he s been promised another name.\n\nARYA turns around, runs out onto the balcony, and jumps off. She grunts as her hands and feet connect with the ground. The sprints off through the streets, pushing people out of the way. The WAIF emerges from the door to LADY CRANE s apartment, spies ARYA, and chases after her. ARYA runs through an alleyway. A man pushes a cart in her way. She slides underneath it and continues running. The WAIF jumps clean over the cart. ARYA turns a corner and runs down a set of stairs. A woman dumps a barrel of water on the ground outside the door to a room at the bottom of the steps. ARYA sees her and darts into the room. The WAIF turns the corner to the steps but stops when she does not see ARYA. The room ARYA has entered is a sauna. She moves through it. A number of men in towels are relaxing in the heat. ARYA emerges from the door on the opposite side of the sauna and looks around. She enters the crowd, walking through it. The WAIF appears on a high wall behind her, then jumps down into the crowd. ARYA turns back to see her and runs away. The WAIF pursues her. ARYA reaches the end of the marketplace and jumps off a high wall. She lands on a large set of steps where many fruit merchants have laid their baskets. She tumbles down the steps, knocking over the baskets as she goes and grunting with pain. The crowd clamors. ARYA comes to a stop at the bottom of the steps. She puts her hand to her stomach. Her hand comes away bloody. The WAIF appears at the top of the steps. ARYA sees her, stands, and throws herself over a small wall into an alleyway. The WAIF follows her. ARYA whimpers as she moves through the alleyway. She leaves blood stains on everything she touches. She enters a small, dark room, lit by a single candle. The WAIF follows her inside, knife in hand. ARYA kneels in the small living space she has made for herself. The WAIF enters and shuts the door behind her.\n\nWAIF: It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?\n\nARYA retrieves Needle from beneath a blanket and stands.\n\nWAIF: Haven t we been through this already? That won t help you.\n\nThe WAIF advances. ARYA holds Needle up in front of her face, closes her eyes, and cuts the candle in half. The room goes dark.\n\nCUT TO: BRAAVOS - HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE\n\nJAQEN enters the main hall. He notices a blood trail on the floor leading to the Hall of Faces. He follows the trail and enters the Hall. The trail leads to one of the columns bearing the faces. The WAIF s bloody face rests in one of the sconces.\n\nARYA: You told her to kill me.\n\nARYA appears behind JAQEN, pointing Needle at him. JAQEN turns to face her.\n\nJAQEN: Yes. But here you are. And there she is.\n\nJAQEN pushes his chest against Needle s point.\n\nJAQEN: Finally a girl is no one.\n\nARYA: A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I m going home.\n\nJAQEN smiles.

Steady.\n\nBROTHER RAY is standing beneath the framing, addressing two men who are hoisting up a log.\n\nRAY: Up she goes.\n\nRAY turns to another man and slaps him on the back.\n\nRAY: Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?\n\nRAY walks a few paces away, grabs an ax, and lifts it up to a man standing on the church framing.\n\nRAY: Here you are, son.\n\nThe man standing on the framing takes the ax. RAY turns to see two men carrying a log into the opening beneath the framing. He waves them in.\n\nRAY: Oh, gentlemen, please.\n\nRAY walks out from beneath the framing and addresses more men carrying logs.\n\nRAY. And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on.\n\nRAY hurries beneath one of the logs and laughs. He turns and looks up at the church framing, smiles, and nods. In a field a little ways off, more men are carrying larger logs towards the church framing. Four men carry each log. A man carrying one of these heavy logs by himself comes into view. He drops the log in front of the church framing and pants, then turns to look out over the landscape. The man is SANDOR CLEGANE, The Hound.\nTITLE SEQUENCEEXT. RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTSSANDOR repeatedly swings an ax into a horizontal log. Woods chips fly everywhere. RAY walks up behind SANDOR.\n\nRAY: In all my days I ve never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?\n\nSANDOR: Just one.\n\nRAY: Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.\n\nSANDOR sinks the ax into the log.\n\nSANDOR: He was a woman.\n\nRAY laughs. SANDOR continues chopping. RAY walks away.\n\nCUT TO: BROTHER RAY S ENCAMPMENT\n\nA man standing beneath the church framing rings a bell. All of  the men rush down off the church framing and father at the food stations. The women divvy out food. RAY pours a cup of water and walks among the people. They are all sitting down on the ground and eating. SANDOR is sitting on a rock away from everyone else, eating. RAY approaches him from behind and hands him the cup of water. SANDOR takes it.\n\nRAY: I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.\n\nSANDOR: I m used to it.\n\nSANDOR drinks the entire cup of water.\n\nRAY: When I found you, I thought you d been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there.\n\nRAY sits down next to SANDOR and points at SANDOR s right knee.\n\nRAY: I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn t. Now, I reckoned you d die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn t. What kept you going?\n\nSANDOR pauses and stares ahead.\n\nSANDOR: Hate.\n\nSANDOR continues eating.\n\nRAY: No, there s a reason you re still here.\n\nSANDOR: Aye, there s a reason. I m a big fucker and I m tough to kill.\n\nRAY: No, a reason. Gods aren t done with you yet.\n\nSANDOR smiles. RAY stands and walks a few paces away from SANDOR, then turns to face him.\n\nSANDOR: I ve heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though.\n\nRAY: Well, maybe he was right. I don t know much about the gods.\n\nSANDOR: You re in the wrong line of work.\n\nRAY: Oh, there s plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don t. I don t even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it s the old gods. Or maybe it s the Lord of Light. Or maybe they re all the same fucking thing. I don t know. What matters, I believe, is that there s something greater than us. And whatever it is, it s got plans for Sandor Clegane.\n\nSANDOR stops eating and stares up at RAY. RAY nods at him.\n\nSANDOR: You didn t know me back in my time. You don t know the things I ve done.\n\nRAY: I ve heard stories.\n\nSANDOR: If the gods are real...why haven t they punished me?\n\nRAY: They have.\n\nRAY walks away.

The HIGH SPARROW enters.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Your Grace. What are we reading today?\n\nMARGAERY: The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Ah,  As water rounds the stones, smoothing- - \n\nMARGAERY:  Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman s love calm a man s brute nature. A wife salves her husband s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep. \n\nHIGH SPARROW: You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don t have a drop of the Mother s mercy in their blood and savages who can t read at all who understand the Father s wisdom.\n\nMARGAERY: For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: They are hard to love.\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW sits down on a bench.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we d look like without our fine clothes. How d we smell without perfume.\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW sighs.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Can I ask you about a personal matter?\n\nMARGAERY: Of course.\n\nMARGAERY sits on the bench beside the HIGH SPARROW.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven t joined him in the marriage bed.\n\nMARGAERY: No.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves.\n\nMARGAERY: It s just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Congress does not require desire on the woman s part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work.\n\nMARGAERY: Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you ve made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW stands.\n\nMARGAERY: My grandmother?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - OLENNA S CHAMBER\n\nMARGAERY and OLENNA are sitting at a table. SEPTA UNELLA stands several feet away, watching them.\n\nOLENNA: Does it move or talk?

SEPTA UNELLA follows them out. MARGAERY sits at the table.\n\nOLENNA (to SEPTA UNELLA): You re not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...\n\nMARGAERY: Grandmother.\n\nOLENNA: ...until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.\n\nMARGAERY: Grandmother, please.\n\nOLENNA sits across from MARGAERY.\n\nOLENNA: What have they done to you?\n\nMARGAERY: You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith.\n\nOLENNA: We marched for you.\n\nMARGAERY: The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn t. They showed mercy.\n\nOLENNA: And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?\n\nMARGAERY: Loras s only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He ll have to renounce his name and title...\n\nOLENNA: Have you lost your mind?\n\nMARGAERY: ...and live his life as a penitent.\n\nOLENNA: He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.\n\n\nMARGAERY: He can begin again.\n\nOLENNA: As a mindless fanatic.\n\nMARGAERY: As a free man.\n\nOLENNA: You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.\n\nMARGAERY stands.\n\nMARGAERY: I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.\n\nMARGAERY walks around the table and kneels before OLENNA. Her back is to SEPTA UNELLA.\n\nMARGAERY: But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home.\n\nOLENNA: I will never leave you. Never.\n\nMARGAERY: You must.\n\nMARGAERY slips a piece of paper into OLENNA s hand. MARGAERY s eyes widen.\n\nMARGAERY: Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.\n\nMARGAERY stands.\n\nMARGAERY: The Mother watches over us all.\n\nOLENNA stands.\n\nOLENNA: I ll see you soon, my dear.\n\nMARGAERY and OLENNA embrace. MARGAERY closes her eyes and then steps back.\n\nMARGAERY: Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.\n\nOLENNA nods and walks back into her chamber. MARGAERY stifles tears. She regains her composure and turns to face SEPTA UNELLA.\n\nMARGAERY: Shall we pray?\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - OLENNA S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY\n\nOLENNA walks out onto the balcony and shuts the door behind her.

SOUTH OF THE WALL - WILDLING ENCAMPMENTJON SNOW, SANSA, DAVOS, TORMUND, and WUN WUN are meeting with DIM DALBA and the other Wildling leaders. They are all gathered around a fire pit.\n\nDIM DALBA: We said we d fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn t what we agreed to. These aren t White Walkers. This isn t an army of the dead. This isn t our find.\n\nTORMUND: If it weren t for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King s army. And I d be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.\n\nDIM DALBA: Remember Mance s camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what s left of us. And if we lose this, we re gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We ll be the last of the free folk.\n\nJON SNOW: That s what ll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you re here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they ll come for you. You re right. This isn t your fight. You shouldn t have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn t be asking you. It s not the deal we made. I need you with me if we re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you re going to survive.\n\nTORMUND gestures to JON SNOW.\n\nTORMUND: The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we re cowards. And if that s what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk.\n\nWUN WUN stands.\n\nWUN WUN: Snow.\n\nWUN WUN walks away. DIM DALBA looks at the men around him. One of them nods. DIM DALBA walks up to JON SNOW and holds out his hand. JON takes it. DIM DALBA returns to his men.\n\nJON SNOW (to TORMUND): Are you sure they ll come?\n\nTORMUND: We re not clever like you southerners. When we say we ll do something, we do it.\n\nJON SNOW exhales.\nINT. RED KEEP - OLENNA S CHAMBEROLENNA is sitting at a table, writing. CERSEI enters with GREGOR in tow.\n\nCERSEI: I heard you were leaving King s Landing.\n\nOLENNA: That is hardly your concern.\n\nCERSEI: Your grandson is still a prisoner. You ll leave him rotting in a cell?\n\nOLENNA: Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.\n\nCERSEI: You re right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.\n\nOLENNA: Good.\n\nCERSEI: I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.\n\nOLENNA: I wonder if you re the worst person I ve ever met. At a certain age, it s hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I ll never forget it.\n\nCERSEI: You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It s the only truth I know. We must defend them.\n\nOLENNA: I m leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you re half as bright as you think you are, you ll find your way out of here, too.\n\nCERSEI: Never. I ll never leave my son.\n\nOLENNA: What ll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother s gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You re surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You re going to kill them all by yourself? You ve lost, Cersei. It s the only joy I can find in all this misery.\n\nOLENNA goes back to writing.\nEXT. RIVERRUN - OUTSKIRTSA Lannister army approaches Riverrun led by JAIME and BRONN.

Keep going.\n\nMAN #2: Keep it moving!\n\nBRONN: Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.\n\nJAIME: Someone certainly does.\n\nJAIME looks at BRONN.\n\nBRONN: Oh, no. Not me. I m just an upjumped sellsword.\n\nJAIME: You re an anointed knight. There s quite a difference.\n\nBRONN: Aye, knights don t get paid.\n\nJAIME: You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.\n\nBRONN: That s like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.\n\nJAIME: I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.\n\nBRONN: You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.\n\nJAIME: And you ll get all three. A Lannister always- -\n\nBRONN: Don t say it.

Some Frey men gather around and stare at them. LOTHAR is standing at the foot of Riverrun, shouting up at the castle walls. BLACK WALDER is behind him, standing on a makeshift hangman s platform. EDMURE is also on the platform with a noose around his neck. JAIME and BRONN watch them.\n\nLOTHAR: Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we ll hang him.\n\nBRYNDEN TULLY, the Blackfish, walks along Riverrun s castle wall and comes to a stop in front of an arrowslit. He stares out at LOTHAR, BLACK WALDER, and EDMURE.\n\nLOTHAR: This is your last warning. Yield the castle.\n\nLOTHAR looks back at BLACK WALDER. BLACK WALDER takes the noose off of EDMURE s neck and draws a knife.\n\nBLACK WALDER: You think I won t do it, old man?\n\nBLACK WALDER holds the knife to EDMURE s neck.\n\nBLACK WALDER: I sliced your niece s throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.\n\nBRYNDEN: Go on, then. Cut his throat.\n\nBRYNDEN walks away. LOTHAR looks at BLACK WALDER and shrugs. BLACK WALDER takes the knife away from EDMURE s neck. Some Frey men take EDMURE away. JAIME, BRONN, and the Lannister army advance towards LOTHAR and BLACK WALDER, and stop in front of them.\n\nJAIME: Lothar, is it?\n\nLOTHAR: Ser Jaime. We didn t know you were coming.\n\nJAIME:  Cause you didn t set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.\n\nBRONN: Good thing we re friends or we d be fucking you in the ass right now.\n\nJAIME: Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.\n\nBLACK WALDER waves at the Frey men escorting EDMURE.\n\nBLACK WALDER: Whoa, whoa.\n\nThe Frey men stop walking. BLACK WALDER approaches JAIME.\n\nLOTHAR: Walder.\n\nLOTHAR puts his hand out to stop BLACK WALDER, but BLACK WALDER pushes him away. BLACK WALDER walks up to JAIME.\n\nBLACK WALDER: Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.\n\nJAIME looks BLACK WALDER up and down.\n\nJAIME: Only a fool makes threats he s not prepared to carry out. Now let s say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I d do?\n\nBLACK WALDER: I don t give a rat s- -\n\nJAIME hits BLACK WALDER across the face with his gold hand. BLACK WALDER staggers back beside LOTHAR.\n\nJAIME: I m here by the king s command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you d like to take his place.\n\nLOTHAR: Apologies, Ser Jaime.\n\nLOTHAR waves at the Frey men escorting EDMURE.\n\nLOTHAR: Do as he says.\n\nJAIME: The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he ll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.\n\nBRONN: Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.\n\nBLACK WALDER: Those are our siege towers- -\n\nJAIME: As I said, the siege is under my command. If that s not to your liking, go home.\n\nLOTHAR and BLACK WALDER walk away. BRONN walks up behind JAIME.\n\nJAIME: Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.\n\nBRONN: A parley or a fight?\n\nJAIME: He s an old man.\n\nBRONN: You ve got one hand. My money s on the old boy.\nEXT. BEAR ISLANDThe castle of House Mormont sits atop a high hill. Waterfalls pour out below. A bird screeches.\n\nCUT TO: BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER\n\nLYANNA MORMONT sits at a high table flanked by a commander and a maester. JON SNOW, SANSA, and DAVOS enter. Some guards close the doors behind them.\n\nJON SNOW: Lady Mormont.\n\nLYANNA: Welcome to Bear Island.\n\nJON SNOW looks at SANSA.\n\nSANSA: I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I m sure you will be, too.\n\nLYANNA: I doubt it. My mother wasn t a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb.\n\nJON SNOW: I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -\n\nLYANNA: I think we ve had enough small talk. What are you here?\n\nJON SNOW: Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -\n\nLYANNA: I remember what it said.  Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. \n\nJON SNOW: Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont s allegiance.\n\nLYANNA leans towards her maester. They whisper to each other. LYANNA turns back to face JON SNOW.\n\nLYANNA: As far as I understand, you re a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I ve heard conflicting reports.\n\nSANSA: I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.\n\nLYANNA: If you say so. In any case, you don t just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.\n\nJON SNOW: Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -\n\nLYANNA: I understand that I m responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else s war?\n\nJON SNOW and SANSA fall silent. DAVOS steps forward.\n\nDAVOS: If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel.\n\nLYANNA: I don t know you, Ser ?\n\nDAVOS: Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.\n\nLYANNA turns to her maester.\n\nDAVOS: You needn t ask your maester about my house. It s rather new.\n\nLYANNA settles back into her chair.\n\nLYANNA: All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?\n\nDAVOS: You never thought you d find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I d be in my position. I was a crabber s son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I m here because this isn t someone else s war. It s our war.\n\nLYANNA: Go on, Ser Davos.\n\nDAVOS: Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn t between a few squabbling houses. It s between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.\n\nLYANNA: Is this true?\n\nJON SNOW nods.\n\nJON SNOW: Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.\n\nDAVOS: As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won t stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there s no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together.\n\nLYANNA s maester leans over to whisper in her ear, but she waves him away.\n\nLYANNA: House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today.\n\nJON SNOW: Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?\n\n\nLYANNA leans to her military commander and they whisper to each other.\n\nLYANNA: 62.\n\nJON SNOW: 62?\n\nLYANNA: We are not a large house, but we re a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.\n\nDAVOS: If they re half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed.\n\nLYANNA smiles and nods.\nEXT. RIVERRUN - LANNISTER ENCAMPMENTJAIME is on horseback, galloping through the encampment. He is accompanied by a bannerman and a regiment of foot soldiers. When he reaches the bridge leading to Riverrun s castle, he dismounts his horse and walks across it. He stands at the foot of the bridge and stares down into the water. Above, several Tully soldiers notch their crossbows and point them at him through arrowslits. The drawbridge lowers. BRYNDEN stands on the other side, accompanied by a regiment of Tully soldiers. BRYNDEN walks out across the drawbridge alone and approaches JAIME.\n\nBRYNDEN: Kingslayer.\n\nJAIME: Blackfish.\n\nBRYNDEN: I assume you re here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don t see Sansa and Arya.\n\nJAIME: I don t have them.\n\nBRYNDEN: Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?\n\nJAIME shakes his head.\n\nBRYNDEN: Then why are you here?\n\nJAIME: You know why I m here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You re trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -\n\nBRYNDEN: Or you ll kill Edmure?\n\nBRYNDEN walks past JAIME.\n\nBRYNDEN: My nephew s marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.\n\nJAIME: It won t stop with Edmure. You ll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.\n\nBRYNDEN: Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.\n\nJAIME positions himself beside BRYNDEN.\n\nJAIME: We ll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I ll spare the lives of your men. On my honor.\n\nBRYNDEN: Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.\n\nJAIME: The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?\n\nBRYNDEN turns to face JAIME and walks close to him.\n\nBRYNDEN: As long as I m standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I m ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?\n\nBRYNDEN walks past JAIME and continues back across the drawbridge.\n\nJAIME: You clearly have no intention of saving your men s lives. Why did you come to treat with me?\n\nBRYNDEN turns back to face JAIME.\n\nBRYNDEN: Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.\n\nJAIME: Well, now you have.\n\nBRYNDEN: Aye, now I have. I m disappointed.\n\nBRYNDEN turns around and walks back inside the castle. The drawbridge begins to close. JAIME scrunches up his face, turns around, and walks back across the bridge.\nEXT. DEEPWOOD MOTTE - COURTYARDJON SNOW, SANSA, and DAVOS are meeting with ROBETT GLOVER. Several men serving under ROBETT stand in attendance.\n\nROBETT: The answer is no.\n\nJON SNOW: Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.\n\nROBETT: I ve heard enough. We ve only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.\n\nJON SNOW: The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -\n\nROBETT: Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?\n\nJON SNOW: House Mormont.\n\nROBETT: And?\n\nJON SNOW: We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -\n\nROBETT: I don t care about ravens. You re asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?\n\nJON SNOW: The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.\n\nROBETT laughs.\n\nROBETT: Then the rumors are true. I didn t dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.\n\nROBETT turns around and heads up the stairs towards a door attended by his men.\n\nJON SNOW: Lord Glover.\n\nROBETT: There s nothing else to say.\n\nSANSA: I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.\n\nJON SNOW glares at SANSA. ROBETT turns on his heel and walks up close to SANSA.\n\nROBETT: Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father s death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb s call and hailed him King in the North.\n\nROBETT gets closer to SANSA.\n\nROBETT: And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.\n\nROBETT looks at JON SNOW and then back at SANSA.\n\nROBETT: I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead.\n\nROBETT turns, climbs the stairs to the door, and walks through it. SANSA and JON SNOW look down.\nEXT. LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAYMany boats bearing the sigil of House Greyjoy on their sails are docked in the bay near the Long Bridge. Chatter and laughter can be heard from the Long Bridge.\n\nCUT TO: LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR\n\nMany Ironborn men are communing with prostitutes. THEON sits at a table alone, looking back at forth at them. YARA sits down at his table accompanied by a prostitute. She and the prostitute kiss at length. THEON does not look at them.\n\nTHEON: Why did we have to come here?\n\nYARA: Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.\n\nTHEON: I don t want one.\n\nYARA sighs and turns back to the prostitute..\n\nYARA: Don t go far, love.\n\nYARA kisses the prostitutes breast.\n\nYARA: I ll find you in a bit.\n\nThe prostitute stands. YARA kisses her backside and then slaps it. The prostitute giggles and runs away. YARA laughs and grabs a drink.\n\nYARA: Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn t interest you anymore?\n\nTHEON scrunches up his face.\n\nYARA: I m sorry. I won t joke about it. I ll never hurt you, little brother. Don t you know that?\n\nYARA pours herself another drink.\n\nTHEON: You think Uncle Euron s hunting for us?\n\nYARA: Of course he is. As long as we re alive, we re a threat.\n\nTHEON: He ll find us.\n\nYARA: It s a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.\n\nTHEON: I don t want any.\n\nYARA: I don t care what you want. Drink.\n\nTHEON takes a small sip of his drink.\n\nYARA: Drink it all.\n\nTHEON drinks deeper.\n\nYARA: You re Ironborn, Theon. I know you ve had some bad years.\n\nTHEON: Some bad years?\n\nYARA: But I m tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.\n\nTHEON takes another deep drink.\n\nYARA: Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink.\n\nTHEON drinks more deeply..\n\nYARA: You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you re never going back. We ll get justice for you.\n\nTHEON: If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.\n\nYARA: Fuck justice, then. We ll get revenge. Drink.\n\nTHEON downs the rest of his ale. YARA moves closer to THEON.\n\nYARA: Listen to me. If you re so broken that there s no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you re staying, Theon, I need you. We re gonna sail to Meereen. We re gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we re gonna take back the Iron Islands.\n\nYARA places her hand on the back of THEON s neck.\n\nYARA: Are you with me? Are you really with me?\n\nTHEON slowly raises his head up and locks eyes with YARA. He nods. YARA smiles and kisses his forehead.\n\nYARA: Now, since it s my last night ashore for a long while, I m gonna go fuck the tits off this one.\n\nYARA stands, pats THEON on the back, walks over to the prostitute she was communing with earlier, and takes her hand. THEON stares blankly to the side.\nEXT. NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENTJON SNOW, SANSA, and DAVOS are riding horses through the encampment.\n\nDAVOS: Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.\n\nSANSA: And that s a good thing?\n\nDAVOS: He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There s a stream down there for the horses.\n\nJON SNOW: We re not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..\n\nDAVOS: Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.\n\nJON SNOW: We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.\n\nThey all dismount their horses and begin walking side by side.\n\nDAVOS: 2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -\n\nSANSA: 62 Mormonts.\n\nDAVOS: It s not what we d hoped for. But we still have a chance if we re careful and smart.\n\nDAVOS spots two men fighting.\n\nDAVOS: For fuck s sake.\n\nDAVOS hurries over to the men. JON SNOW and SANSA watch him go and then continue walking.\n\nSANSA: So he s your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?\n\nJON SNOW: Ser Davos is the reason I m standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.\n\nSANSA: Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn t have a head?\n\nSANSA stops walking. JON keeps walking a few paces and then turns to face her.\n\nSANSA: It s not enough. We need more men.\n\nJON SNOW: There s no time.\n\nSANSA: If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -\n\nJON SNOW moves close to SANSA.\n\nJON SNOW: We fight with the army we have.\n\nJON SNOW looks over SANSA s shoulder at DAVOS. He is standing in front of the fighting men, who are wrestling on the ground.\n\nDAVOS: Friends, this is not worth fighting over!\n\nJON SNOW walks past SANSA and away.\n\nDAVOS: This ll be it, now. Right now, we don t need to be fighting.\n\nOne of the men gets in DAVOS  face.\n\nMAN: Who the fuck are you?\n\nDAVOS: Hold on.\n\nMAN #2: Yeah, who the fuck are you?\n\nSANSA spies the maester of Bear Island handling some crates containing ravens. He holds up one of the crates to LYANNA MORMONT.\n\nCUT TO: NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT\n\nSANSA is writing a letter. She signs her name, pours wax, and presses the wax with the direwolf sigil of House Stark. She picks up the letter and rereads it, then stares ahead.\nEXT. RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY S ENCAMPMENTAll of RAY s followers are gathered together in a circle. RAY is standing in the center, speaking to them all. SANDOR stands at the far end of the flock, behind everyone else. The church framing stands on a hill in the background.\n\nRAY: I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn t. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That s all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I m your arsonist. Steal that farmer s crops. Good, I m your thief. Kill those young lads so they won t take up arms against us. I m your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren t animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy s throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back.\n\nRAY sits down on a stump next to one of the men and rests his arm on the man s shoulder.\n\nRAY: That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn t eat, I couldn t sleep.\n\nSANDOR looks down.\n\nRAY: All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son s name. I ll hear her screaming the rest of my life.\n\nRAY stands and walks back to the center of the circle.\n\nRAY: Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I ve got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That s all any of us can do, isn t it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people.\n\nRAY stares at SANDOR.\n\nRAY: It s never too late to come back.\n\nSANDOR returns RAY s gaze but is distracted by three horsemen coming up the way. RAY turns to look at them. SANDOR walks a few paces into the midst of RAY s followers and stares at the riders.\n\nRAY: And it s not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It s not even about the gods. It s about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.\n\nThe three riders reach the group and stop. RAY walks out to meet them. All of RAY s followers stand. The riders are FLYNN, MORGAN, and LEM LEMONCLOAK.\n\nRAY: Seven save you, friends. How can we help you?\n\nLEM: What are you doing here?\n\nRAY: Well, we re talking about life. You?\n\nLEM: Protecting the people.\n\nRAY: Well, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?\n\nLEM: Do you have any horses?\n\nRAY: No horses. No gold. No steel.\n\nLEM: Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work.\n\nRAY: I m sure it is. You re welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here.\n\nLEM: Stay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors.\n\nLEM smiles. The three riders turn the horses around and ride off. SANDOR watches them leave.\n\nCUT TO: RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS\n\nSANDOR is splitting wood with an ax on a chopping block. RAY walks up the path. SANDOR sees him coming but continues chopping.\n\nSANDOR:  Seven save you, friends. \n\nRAY: I m a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?\n\nSANDOR: They don t believe in your Seven. They re from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.\n\nRAY: Aye, well, all are welcome here. Anyway, we got nothing for them.\n\nSANDOR stops chopping.\n\nSANDOR: Sure, you do. You ve got food, you ve got steel even if you say you don t. And you ve got women.\n\nRAY: What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?\n\nSANDOR shrugs and sighs.\n\nRAY: It d be you against all of them. I mean, these people don t know how to fight.\n\nSANDOR: You do.\n\nRAY: I m done with fighting.\n\nSANDOR: Even if it s to protect yourself?\n\nRAY: Violence is a disease. You don t cure a disease by spreading it to more people.\n\nSANDOR: You don t cure it by dying, either.\n\nSANDOR resumes chopping.\n\nRAY: You ve done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.\n\nRAY starts back up the path.\n\nSANDOR: It s gonna be a cold night. We ll need firewood.\n\nRAY: I ll save you a bowl of stew. Might even have some ale hidden away.\nEXT. BRAAVOS - MARKETPLACEPeople of all sorts line the streets. ARYA walks among them with her hands behind her back. She encounters two men sitting across from each other at a small table.\n\nMAN: He s not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleet s in Slaver s Bay. I m inclined to believe him. I m not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.\n\nARYA walks up beside the men and addressing the one who was speaking.\n\nARYA: You re Westerosi.\n\nMAN: What do you care?\n\nARYA: I want to book passage home.\n\nThe man laughs.\n\nMAN: You? Can t afford it.\n\nARYA tosses a bag of coins on the table in front of the man. The man opens it and pulls out some coins.\n\nMAN: Where d you steal this from?\n\nARYA: Why do you care?\n\nMAN: We leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage.\n\nARYA throws another bag of coins on the table.\n\nARYA: I want a cabin. And we ll leave at dawn.\n\nARYA walks past the man and grabs the coin purses off the table on the way.\n\nARYA: See you at sunrise.\n\nARYA walks onto a bridge and stops to stare out at the Titan. An old woman approaches her.\n\nWOMAN: Sweet girl.\n\nARYA turns to face the old woman. The old woman draws a blade and slashes ARYA across the stomach. She grabs ARYA by the neck and holds her tight to her body, the stabs ARYA severl times in the stomach and twists the blade. With her free hand, she reaches up and pulls off her face, revealing she is the WAIF in disguise. ARYA headbutss the WAIF, pushes her, and then runs and jumps off the opposite side of the bridge, plummeting into the water. The WAIF rushes to the side of the bridge ARYA jumped off and stares into the water. Bubbles and blood rise to the surface. The WAIF straightens her shirt and walks away.\n\nCUT TO: BRAAVOS - MARKETPLACE SHORE\n\nARYA bursts through the surface of the water, gasping. She pulls herself up onto some steps , turns onto her back, and clutches her bleeding stomach.\n\nCUT TO: BRAAVOS - MARKETPLACE\n\nARYA stumbles through the crowd, clutching her bleeding stomach and shivering. She looks from face to face. Everyone stares at her blankly.\nEXT. RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY S ENCAMPMENT WOODSSANDOR is chopping a branch with a machete. He tosses the machete down and takes a drink of water, then hears people screaming and runs through the woods.\n\nCUT TO: RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY S ENCAMPMENT\n\nThe dead bodies of RAY s followers are strewn all over the ground. SANDOR walks among them. He approaches the church framing. RAY is hanging by the neck from the framing, dead. SANDOR looks up at him and sighs. He walks to a nearby stump and retrieves an ax.\nCREDITS\n\n", "episode_56": "\n\nTITLE SEQUENCEEXT. BEYOND THE WALLHeavy snow is falling. MEERA is dragging BRAN s sledge through the forest. BRAN s eyes are glazed white. He experiences many visions of the past all at once. MEERA staggers and falls against the base of a tree. She puts all her weight into pulling the sledge, but it does not budge. She begins crying and goes to BRAN, cradling his head. BRAN continues to have rapid fire visions, then sees a group of wights running through the woods. He wakes up from the visions and looks at MEERA.\n\nBRAN: Meera. They found us.\n\nMEERA looks out into the woods and sees the group of wights. She begins crying and embraces BRAN.\n\nMEERA: I m so sorry.\n\nThe wights converge on MEERA and BRAN. Moments before they reach them, a cloaked rider appears. The rider s horse kicks one of the wights out of the way, then the rider extends a chain which lights on fire at the end. Two wights charge, and the rider hits them both with the chain, setting them on fire. A third wight tries to attack his horse, but the horse s bulk rebuffs it into a tree and it crumbles. The rider plunges a chain-sickle into the chest of another wight, then rides forward, dragging the wight behind his horse. He sets another wight on fire with the chain, launching it into the air, and then approaches BRAN and MEERA.\n\nRIDER: Come with me, now.\n\nA large group of wights approaches.\n\nRIDER: The dead don t rest.\n\nThe rider leans down and hoists BRAN up onto his horse. MEERA takes the rider s hand and joins them on the horse s back. The three of them ride off into the forest with wights in pursuit.\nEXT. ROAD TO HORN HILLSAM, GILLY, and LITTLE SAMare riding in a carriage escorted by several soldiers. GILLY looks out the window. SAM is holding LITTLE SAM.\n\nGILLY: It s so green.\n\nSAM: Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer s over, you ll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you ll find more green here than anywhere else.\n\nGILLY: You re nervous. You re a nervous talker.\n\nSAM looks away.\n\nGILLY: That s not any better being a nervous mute.\n\nSAM: I didn t think I d ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn t. A person just doesn t feel welcome at that point.\n\nGILLY looks at LITTLE SAM.\n\nSAM: And I certainly didn t expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.\n\nGILLY: That Little Sam is your baby.\n\nSAM: Yes, now that s very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he ll take you in. He ll get an education. He ll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?\n\nGILLY: What did you tell your family about me?\n\n\nSAM: I told them I met you in the North.\n\nGILLY: Did you tell them how far north?\n\nSAM: Well, it wasn t a very large piece of parchment.\n\nGILLY: You didn t tell them where I m really from? You didn t tell them I m a wildling?\n\nSAM: The thing is...my father doesn t like wildlings. He hoped I d make a man of myself by  killing some bloody wildlings,  so it s probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.\n\nGILLY looks out the window.\n\nGILLY: I think we re here.\n\nSAM looks out the window. The carriage is approaching the castle on Horn Hill.\n\nCUT TO: HORN HILL - COURTYARD\n\nA party of guests is lined up at the entrance to the castle courtyard. GILLY and SAM enter. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM. SAM s mother, MELESS, and his sister, TALLA, descend a set of stairs and approach them.\n\nMELESSA: Sam. Oh, Sam.\n\nSAM and MELESSA embrace.\n\nSAM: Oh, hello, Mother.\n\nMELESSA: I never thought I d see you again. You look wonderful.\n\nSAM: Oh.\n\nTALLA embraces SAM and he grunts.\n\nSAM: Talla? Gods, you re a woman now.\n\nTALLA: Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway. He has yellow teeth- -\n\nMELESSA: That s enough, Talla.\n\nSAM: Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.\n\nGILLY bows her head and curtsies.\n\nMELESSA: Oh, my. You are lovely.\n\nGILLY: I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.\n\nSAM: Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell.\n\nMELESSA and TALLA smile at each other. MELESSA approaches the baby and smiles.\n\nMELESSA: Hello, little one. It s me, your grandmother.\n\nLITTLE SAM smiles and touches MELESSA s face.\n\nMELESSA: May I hold him?\n\nGILLY: Yes, of course.\n\nGILLY passes LITTLE SAM to MELESSA.\n\nMELESSA (to LITTLE SAM): You have a curious mind, I can tell. You ll be a scholar like your father.\n\nSAM: Where is Father? And Dickon?\n\nMELESSA: They re on a hunt. They ll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.\n\nMELESSA passes LITTLE SAM back to GILLY. SAM and MELESSA proceed up the steps. TALLA takes GILLY s arm and they follow.\n\nTALLA: Come, you ll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What s your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.\nINT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELORTOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are standing in the central chamber. TOMMEN lights a candle.\n\nTOMMEN: Is there no other way?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: You re afraid for her?\n\nTOMMEN: Of course I m afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: She ll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn t your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She s truly opened her heart to them.\n\nTOMMEN: She s always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: And now she s devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM\n\nMARGAERY is sitting on a bench reading a book. The door opens. TOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are visible outside. TOMMEN enters and stares at MARGAERY. The HIGH SPARROW closes the door behind TOMMEN. MARGAERY sets down her book and stands. They embrace.\n\nTOMMEN: Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?\n\nMARGAERY: No, Your Grace.\n\nTOMMEN: I ve missed you. More than you could know.\n\nMARGAERY: We ll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.\n\nTOMMEN: Better how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says there s no other way.\n\nMARGAERY: Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?\n\nTOMMEN: Yes, a few times. Have you?\n\nMARGAERY: Yes, I have. He s not quite what we thought he was, is he?\n\nTOMMEN scrunches up his face. MARGAERY chuckles and turns away.\n\nMARGAERY: You think I m mad. I sound mad.\n\nTOMMEN: No. No, you don t. You- - you could never. You re right, he s not. He s a lot more- -\n\nMARGAERY: He is. There s something about him. His way of looking at the world. It s not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It s taken me a while. He s helped me.\n\nTOMMEN: What are you talking about? You re a good person. You ve always been a good person. You re the best person I know.\n\nMARGAERY chuckles and retrieves her book from the bench.\n\nTOMMEN: I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.\n\nMARGAERY: Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I ve had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories.\n\nTOMMEN: I don t understand.\n\nMARGAERY rushes to TOMMEN and takes his hand.\n\nMARGAERY: It s all right. It really is. It s such a relief to let go of those lies.\n\nMARGAERY leads him to the bench and they sit down on it together.\n\nTOMMEN: What about Loras?\n\nMARGAERY: I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don t erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all.\nINT. HORN HILL - HALLWAYSAM paces. GILLY enters on the far end of the hall. She is wearing a dress and her hair is done up.\n\nGILLY: It s hard to walk in this.\n\nSAM: It s beautiful. You re beautiful.\n\nGILLY takes SAM s arm and they walk down the hall together.\n\nCUT TO: HORN HILL - DINING HALL\n\nSAM, GILLY, MELESSA, TALLA, DICKON, and RANDYLL are sitting around the dinner table eating. RANDYLL takes a bite and stares at SAM. GILLY looks around at others using their utensils and mimics them. SAM looks at DICKON.\n\nSAM: This venison, it s very tasty. Is it from today s hunt?\n\nDICKON: Well, no. We haven t been able to cure that one yet. This is last week s.\n\nSAM: Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey.\n\nDICKON: Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.\n\nSAM: Oh, that s a fair distance.\n\nDICKON: So do you do much hunting up at the wall?\n\nSAM: Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don t hunt, you don t eat.\n\nDICKON: Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?\n\nSAM: Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say  we,  it s my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She s- - she s quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress.\n\nMELESSA (to GILLY): I imagine it s common where you re from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn t it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.\n\nTALLA: Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.\n\nRANDYLL: That s enough of that.\n\nMELESSA: Samwell, would you care for more bread?\n\nSAM: Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother.\n\nA servant girl retrieves the basket of bread. She holds out the basket to SAM. SAM reaches for the bread.\n\nRANDYLL: Not fat enough already?\n\nSAM waves the servant away.\n\nSAM: I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -\n\nRANDYLL: I read your letter. You re to be a maester.\n\nSAM: Yes. And once I have my chain, I ll return to Castle Black.\n\nRANDYLL: I thought the Night s Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.\n\nSAM puts down his utensils.\n\nRANDYLL: Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I ll wager you still can t sit a horse or wield a sword.\n\nMELESSA: Randyll, to be maester of the Night s Watch is a great honor.\n\nGILLY: He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.\n\nDICKON laughs.\n\nDICKON: There s no such thing.\n\nGILLY: I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker s heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He s a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.\n\nRANDYLL: Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How d you come to meet my son?\n\nGILLY: The Night s Watch came to our keep.\n\nRANDYLL: Where?\n\nSAM: Gilly.\n\nGILLY: North of the Wall.\n\nRANDYLL: North of the Wall? You re a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?\n\nRANDYLL points to a blade mounted on a mantle beside the table.\n\nRANDYLL: It s called Heartsbane. It s been in our family for 500 years. It s Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It s supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole s Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn t you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home.\n\nMELESSA throws down her utensils and stands. She walks to GILLY.\n\nMELESSA: Come, my dear. Talla.\n\nTALLA and GILLY stand and begin to follow MELESSA out of the hall.\n\nMELESSA: I ve lost my appetite.\n\nRANDYLL: He dishonors us.\n\nMELESSA: You dishonor yourself.\n\nRANDYLL (to SAM): Your mother s a fine woman. You re not worthy of her. To please her, I ll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.\n\nCUT TO: HORN HILL - GILLY S GUEST CHAMBER\n\nGILLY is sitting at the foot of the bed. LITTLE SAM is in a crib beside her. SAM stands before them both. He hangs his head.\n\nSAM: I m sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he d turn you and Little Sam away.\n\nGILLY: I m not angry at you. I m angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?\n\nSAM: First light.\n\nLITTLE SAM fusses and reaches for SAM. SAM takes his hand.\n\nSAM: Say good-bye to him for me.\n\nSAM starts off but GILLY stands and gets in his way. She places her hands on his chest and kisses him.\n\nGILLY: You re not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn t know what you are.\n\nSAM: Good-bye, Gilly.\n\nSAM walks to the door. He turns back and stares at GILLY before closing the doors. GILLY looks around the guest chamber and then goes to LITTLE SAM. She pulls his blanket up higher and comforts him. SAM bursts back into the room.\n\nGILLY: Sam?\n\nSAM: We re leaving.\n\nGILLY: What?\n\nSAM: Get your things.\n\nGILLY: I don t have any things.\n\nSAM picks up LITTLE SAM.\n\nGILLY: What are you doing?\n\nSAM: We belong together. All of us.\n\nCUT TO: HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER\n\nSAM and GILLY walk briskly through the hall. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM.\n\nGILLY: What about your mother and sister?\n\nSAM: Oh, they ll understand.\n\nGILLY: Your sister s dress.\n\nSAM grabs a stool and carries it in front of the mantle hosting Heartsbane.\n\nSAM: She won t mind. Looks better on you anyway.\n\nSAM climbs on top of the stool.\n\nGILLY: Sam. That s your father s sword.\n\nSAM lifts Heartsbane off the mantle. He groans and slides it into its scabbard.\n\nSAM: It s my family s sword.\n\nGILLY: Sam. Won t he come for it?\n\nSAM: He can bloody well try.\n\nSAM hops down off the stool.\nEXT. BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUAREThe acting troupe is putting on a repeat performance of The Bloody Hand,  their play about the happenings of Westerosi royalty. AYRA is standing in the crowd in the front row. On stage is CLORENZO portraying JOFFREY, an actress portraying MARGAERY, BIANCA portraying SANSA, BOBONO portraying TYRION, and LADY CRANE portraying CERSEI. CLORENZO is at center stage, brandishing a prop sword.\n\nCLARENZO: The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.\n\nThe actress portraying MARGAERY runs to CLARENZO.\n\nCLARENZO: And to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love.\n\nALL: Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.\n\nCLARENZO: I ll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?\n\nBOBONO approaches CLARENZO and hands him a prop cup.\n\nBOBONO: Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine.\n\nCLARNEZO takes the prop cup and BOBONO walks to center stage, addressing the audience.\n\nBOBONO: The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.\n\nBOBONO laughs and the audience boos. CLARENZO takes a sip from the prop cup, then gags and sputters. The audience gasps. He moves to center stage.\n\nCLARENZO: Poison! Murder! I gasp. I- - I die.\n\nARYA smiles and laughs in the crowd.\n\nCLARENZO: I limp. And it was he \n\nCLARENZO points at BOBONO. BOBONO holds up a prop vial of poison. The audience gasps and boos.\n\nCLARENZO: ...that poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp.\n\nBOBONO laughs and exits with BIANCA. The audience boos. CLARENZO collapses and LADY CRANE kneels down beside him. ARYA laughs. LADY CRANE cradles the head of the actor portraying JOFFREY.\n\nLADY CRANE: My firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain.\n\nARYA s smile fades.\n\nLADY CRANE: Hear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead. For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead. Oh, woe. Oh grief.\n\nARYA notices BIANCA standing offstage. BIANCA is watching LADY CRANE s performance and mouths her lines as she utters them.\n\nLADY CRANE: Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow. All hope is lost. All joy is gone. And there is no tomorrow.\n\nLADY CRANE kisses CLARENZO s cheek and lays his head down. The audience claps. The actors clear out the stage and the prop men change the scene. BOBONO enters carrying a prop crossbow. IZEMBARO, portraying TYWIN, is sitting on a prop toilet.\n\nBOBONO: What is that I hear and smell? Someone I ll soon send to hell.\n\nARYA leaves the front row and moves through the crowd.\n\nBOBONO: It s time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.\n\nBOBONO pretends to shoot IZEMBARO with the crossbow. IZEMBARO cries out.\n\nIZEMBARO: You beast. You beast. You killed my wife and now you ve taken your father s life.\n\nCUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE\n\nARYA enters and walks further inward. On her way through the entrance hall, she sees the prop head the performers use for NED s execution scene.\n\nIZEMBARO (O.S.): No worse child ever stained this land.\n\nCUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE\n\nIZEMBARO: Curse the day I named you.\n\nIZEMBARO groans as though dying and turns to the side. The sound guy makes a farting noise.\n\nBOBONO: My greatest crime. Now I must flee.\n\nCUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE\n\nARYA walks into the actor s break room.\n\nBOBONO (O.S.): Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.\n\nARYA draws the curtain and stares at LADY CRANE s bottle of rum.\n\nBOBONO (O.S.): Don t fear the winter.\n\nCUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE\n\nBOBONO: Fear me!\n\nBOBONO shoots a prop arrow into the audience and laughs. The audience gasps and boos him offstage.\n\nCUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE\n\nIZEMBARO (O.S.): Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca, Clarenzo.\n\nARYA retrieves a vial of from her satchel. She uncorks LADY CRANE s bottle of rum.\n\nCUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE\n\nIZEMBARO, BIANCA, and CLARENZO stand center stage.\n\nIZEMBARO: I give you Bobono.\n\nBOBONO enters the stage and the audience boos.\n\nIZEMBARO: I give you Camello.\n\nCUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE\n\nARYA pours the contents of the vial into LADY CRANE s rum bottle and corks it.\n\nIZEMBARO (O.S.): And last but not least, sweet Lady Crane.\n\nOn stage, LADY CRANE enters and bows. The crowd cheers wildly. AYRA hears the cheering. She tucks the away the vial, draws back the curtain, and exits the break room. The actors are all piling into the area. CAMELLO approaches ARYA in the entrance hallway and hands her his costume cloak.\n\nCAMELLO: Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That s a dear.\n\nIZEMBARO and BIANCA enter.\n\nIZEMBARO (to BIANCA): That crowd was shit.\n\nARYA walks past them and puts down the cloak. She moves to leave. LADY CRANE enters and sees her.\n\nLADY CRANE: Girl.\n\nARYA stops on the steps and looks at LADY CRANE.\n\nLADY CRANE: What are you doing back here?\n\nARYA: Nothing.\n\nLADY CRANE: I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?\n\nARYA: Three times.\n\nLADY CRANE: Did you pay?\n\nARYA smiles.\n\nARYA: No.\n\nARYA walks off the steps to get out of the way of the prop men.\n\nLADY CRANE: I remember when the players came to my village. I didn t have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other s arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.\n\nARYA: You re very good.\n\nLADY CRANE: My final speech is shit.\n\nLADY CRANE takes ARYA by the waist and ushers her towards the break room.\n\nLADY CRANE: But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing s no good.\n\nThey stop in a side corridor.\n\nARYA: So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.\n\nLADY CRANE: How would you change it?\n\nARYA: The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn t just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.\n\nLADY CRANE: What s your name?\n\nARYA: Mercy.\n\nLADY CRANE: You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.\n\nARYA smiles.\n\nLADY CRANE: Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?\n\nARYA: I have to go. My father s waiting for me.\n\nARYA exits. LADY CRANE enter the break room. BIANCA takes off her wig and notices LADY CRANE.\n\nBIANCA: Lady Crane, they loved you.\n\nLADY CRANE removes her wig.\n\nLADY CRANE: They were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.\n\nIZEMBARO: No laugh for Ned s death. These people are worse than animals.\n\nIZEMBARO sips from a mug and gestures to LADY CRANE.\n\nIZEMBARO: But they loved her. They all love her.\n\nCAMELLO removes his wig and approaches LADY CRANE.\n\nCAMELLO: Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.\n\nLADY CRANE: I do what I can with what I m given.\n\nIZEMBARO: With what you re given?\n\nLADY CRANE: Well, I was thinking- -\n\nIZEMBARO: Oh, we re all thinkers now, are we?\n\nIZEMBARO stands, slaps his chest, and walks closer to LADY CRANE.\n\nIZEMBARO: Full to the tits with ideas.\n\nLADY CRANE: I didn t mean- -\n\nIZEMBARO: You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I ve been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I m doing.\n\nIZEMBARO removes his wig.\n\nIZEMBARO: You have no right to an opinion.\n\nLADY CRANE brings a glass of rum to her lips. Just before she drinks, ARYA appears and slaps the glass out of her hands. Everyone in the room stares at ARYA. ARYA points at BIANCA.\n\nARYA: Careful of that one. She wants you dead.\n\nARYA exits. The WAIF is revealed to have been watching.\n\nCUT TO: HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - OUTSIDE\n\nARYA pulls the stones away from where she hid Needle. She pulls Needle from inside the rocks and stares at it.\n\nCUT TO: HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING CHAMBER\n\nJAQEN is cutting the face of a corpse. The WAIF enters.\n\nJAQEN: And?\n\nWAIF: As I expected.\n\nJAQEN: A shame. A girl had many gifts.\n\nJAQEN begins lifting the face off of the corpse.\n\nWAIF: You promised me.\n\nJAQEN: Don t let her suffer.\n\nThe WAIF nods and exits. JAQEN pulls the face from the corpse.\n\nCUT TO: UNKNOWN ALLEY\n\nARYA sets down a lit candle and brandishes Needle. She places Needle on the ground, sits down beside it, and blows out the candle.\nEXT. KING S LANDINGJAIME is wearing armor and sitting atop a horse. He watches as MACE TYRELL, also wearing armor, leads a force of many soldiers down the street. MACE stops in front of JAIME and the soldiers halt.\n\nMACE: My lord.\n\nJAIME: My lord.\n\nMACE turns his horse to face the soldiers.\n\nMACE: My friends, the hour has come. Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children. But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came. Madness has had its day!\n\nMACE turns his horse back the other way and nods at JAIME. JAIME nods back.\n\nCAPTAIN: Forward, march!\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW is standing on the steps beside MARGAERY and SEPTA UNELLA.. They are surrounded by Faith Militant, including LANCEL. The HIGH SPARROW is addressing a large gathering of commoners who stand at the foot of the steps.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother s sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself.\n\nThe crowd murmurs and parts. JAIME and MACE enter, leading the soldiers. MARGAERY gasps to herself. On the side, a smaller group of soldiers sets down a carriage. OLENNA steps out of the carriage.\n\nCAPTAIN: Company, halt! Face front! Turn!\n\nThe soldiers form up and turn to face the steps.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Lord Tyrell.\n\nMACE nods at the HIGH SPARROW.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Ser Jaime.\n\nJAIME: Sorry to interrupt. We re here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we ll be on our way.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: I don t have the authority to give them to you. And you don t have the authority to take them.\n\nThe crowd murmurs. JAIME ushers his horse forward and rides it up the steps. He halts in front of the Faith Militant.\n\nCAPTAIN: Lock spears!\n\nThe soldiers grunt and point their spears towards the Faith Militant.\n\nJAIME: I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: The gods don t recognize his authority in this matter.\n\nJAIME: You already insulted one great house. It won t happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.\n\nThe crowd murmurs. OLENNA motions to MACE with her fan. MACE motions to one of the high ranking soldiers, who nods to the Captain.\n\nCAPTAIN: Order up!\n\nThe soldiers return to a relaxed position.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.\n\nThe doors to the Great Sept of Baelor open. TOMMEN emerges, accompanied by the Kingsguard. The crowd murmurs. JAIME looks back at OLENNA, who looks down. TOMMEN and the Kingsguard walk down the steps until TOMMEN stands beside MARGAERY. TOMMEN takes MARGAERY s hand.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.\n\nThe crowd cheers.\n\nWOMAN: Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!\n\nTOMMEN looks at JAIME. JAIME shakes his head. TOMMEN looks at the crowd.\n\nTOMMEN: The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.\n\nThe crowd cheers.\n\nMACE (to OLENNA): What s happening?\n\nOLENNA: He s beaten us. That s what s happening.\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW smiles at JAIME.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM\n\nThe room is lined with soldiers on either side. TOMMEN is sitting on the throne. KEVAN stands beside him. JAIME stands at the foot of the throne and removes his armor, letting it drop to the floor.\n\nTOMMEN: When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.\n\nJAIME: I ve been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don t have to do this. You don t have to do anything.\n\nTOMMEN: I have to answer to the gods.\n\nJAIME: Not when you re sitting in that chair.\n\nTOMMEN: The Crown s decision on this matter is final.\n\nJAIME: Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods  mercy?\n\nTOMMEN and KEVAN look at each other.\n\nTOMMEN: You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.\nTHE CROSSING - DINING HALLWALDER FREY is sitting in a high chair addressing two of his sons, BLACK WALDER and LOTHAR. One of his young daughter stands beside him. Many other family members sit at the tables, eating.\n\nWALDER: You ve lost it?\n\nBLACK WALDER: Yes, father.\n\nWALDER: It s a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn t lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you.\n\nLOTHAR: He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.\n\nWALDER: You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn t find him. That s what it means to lose something. Now he s come back and taken Riverrun.\n\nBLACK WALDER: I don t think it s fair to blame us- -\n\nWALDER: For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back.\n\nBLACK WALDER: We don t have the men.\n\nWALDER: We ve got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.\n\nBLACK WALDER: The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.\n\nLOTHAR: The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps.\n\nBLACK WALDER: Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.\n\nWALDER slaps his daughter on on the buttocks.\n\nWALDER: If I want excuses, I ll put her in charge. They re laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King s Landing, they re laughing at us.\n\nWALDER stands. Many family members stare at him.\n\nWALDER: I hear it in my sleep! I m not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I ll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back.\n\nLOTHAR: He ll never yield, Father.\n\nWALDER: Oh, he ll yield.\n\nWALDER nods at some servants at the rear of the hall. LOTHAR looks back at the servants. The servants exit. WALDER points first at LOTHAR and then at BLACK WALDER.\n\nWALDER: You ll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark s child in his whore mother s belly, and you ll show him the knife you used to open his niece s throat. And you ll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew.\n\nWALDER pulls his daughter into his lap. The servants return, ushering in a man bound in chains. They undo his chains. The man is EDMURE TULLY. EDMURE stares at WALDER.\n\nWALDER: Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You re going home.\nINT. RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBERJAIME and CERSEI are sitting in chairs across the room from each other.\n\nJAIME: I m being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can t manage it on his own because he s 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.\n\nJAIME stands and paces.\n\nCERSEI: BEtter you re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.\n\nJAIME: I m not going to the Riverlands.\n\nJAIME pours himself a cup of wine.\n\nCERSEI: What, then?\n\nJAIME: I m going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone s ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I ll take them to the sept and I ll remove the High Sparrow s head and every other sparrow head I can find.\n\nCERSEI: You can t.\n\nJAIME: He has our son! He stole our son! He s torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?\n\nCERSEI: We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won t leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it s ours and because you can.\n\nJAIME: You ll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.\n\nCERSEI: It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They ve made us both stronger, all of them.\n\nCERSEI stands and approaches JAIME.\n\nCERSEI: They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we re going to do to them.\n\nJAIME and CERSEI embrace and kiss. CERSEI whispers into JAIME s ear.\n\nCERSEI: We ve always been together. We ll always be together. We re the only two people in the world.\n\nThey resume kissing.\nEXT. BEYOND THE WALLMEERA, BRAN, and the rider are gathered around a campfire. The rider beheads a rabbit and begins draining its blood. MEERA watches him.\n\nMEERA: Why did you help us?\n\nThe rider looks at MEERA from behind his face mask.\n\nRIDER: The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.\n\nMEERA: The Three-Eyed Raven s dead.\n\nRIDER: Now he lives again.\n\nBRAN startles as he comes out of a vision. MEERA goes to him.\n\nRIDER (to BRAN): When I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.\n\nBRAN: Who are you?\n\nThe rider removes his hood and face mask. He is BENJEN STARK. His skin is gray and he has blemishes on his face.\n\nBRAN: Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.\n\nBENJEN: I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker s magic from taking hold.\n\nBRAN: How?\n\nBENJEN: The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.\n\nBRAN: Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.\n\nBENJEN: You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.\n\nBRAN: I didn t have time to learn. I can t control anything.\n\nBENJEN stands and walks over to BRAN and MEERA.\n\nBENJEN: You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.\n\nBENJEN kneels beside BRAN and offers him a cup.\n\nBENJEN: Drink.\n\nBRAN takes the cup and drinks.\n\nBENJEN: One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready.\nEXT. ESSOS ARID LANDSDAENERYS and DAARIO are leading the Dothraki horde on horseback. DAARIO shouts in Dothraki and raises his hand, halting the horde. DAENERYS stares at the face of a mountain crag in the distance.\n\nDAARIO: Everything all right?\n\nDAENERYS: How many days  ride to Meereen?\n\nDAARIO: A week at best.\n\nDAENERYS: How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?\n\nDAARIO: Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more.\n\nDAENERYS: And who has that many?\n\nDAARIO: Nobody.\n\nDAENERYS: Nobody yet.\n\nDAARIO: So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?\n\nDAENERYS: I take what is mine.\n\nDAARIO: You weren t made to sit on a chair in a palance.\n\nDAENERYS: What was I made for?\n\nDAARIO: You re a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.\n\nThe wind howls. DAENERYS stares beyond the mountain crag\n\nDAENERYS: Wait here.\n\nDAENERYS rides away from the horde and around the bend. Time passes. The Dothraki are growing antsy.\n\nDAARIO (speaking Dothraki): I m going after her. Wait for me here.\n\nDAARIO starts off, but stops when a dragon s roar erupts from the sky. The Dothraki look around. The shadow of a dragon appears on the mountainside. DROGON flies over the Dothraki horde with DAENERYS on its back. DROGON circles around and lands in front of the horde. He roars.\n\nDAENERYS (speaking Dothraki):  Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.\n\nThe Dothraki cheer.\n\nDAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?\n\nThe Dothraki cheer.\n\nDAENERYS: Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?\n\nThe Dothraki cheer.\n\nDAENERYS: Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?\n\nThe Dothraki cheer.\n\nDAENERYS: Are you with me?\n\nThe Dothraki continue to cheer.\n\nDAENERYS: Now and always?\n\nDROGON spreads his wings and roars.\nCREDITS\n\n", "episode_55": "\n\nTitle SequenceINT. CASTLE BLACK - SANSA S ROOM\n\nSANSA is knitting. There is a knock at the door.\n\nSANSA: Yes?\n\nA man of the Night s Watch enters.\n\nMAN: For you, my lady.\n\nThe man hands SANSA a scroll. It bears the mockingbird sigil of House Baelish. SANSA unrolls the scroll and reads it.\n\nSANSA: How far is Mole s Town?\n\nCUT TO: MOLE S TOWN - SHACK\n\nLITTLEFINGER is standing in the center of the room. SANSA and BRIENNE enter. LITTLEFINGER turns to greet them.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.\n\nSANSA: Unharmed? What are you doing here?\n\nLITTLEFINGER: I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They re encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.\n\nSANSA: To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn t know, you re an idiot. If you did know, you re my enemy.\n\nSANSA steps closer to LITTLEFINGER.\n\nSANSA: Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark s daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?\n\nLITTLEFINGER: I can t begin to contemplate --\n\nSANSA: What do you think he did to me?\n\nBRIENNE: Lady Sansa asked you a question.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: He beat you.\n\nSANSA: Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Sansa, I --\n\nSANSA: What else?\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Did he cut you?\n\nSANSA: Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: I didn t know.\n\nSANSA: I thought you knew everyone s secrets.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger.\n\nSANSA: The other things he did, ladies aren t supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don t mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: I m so sorry.\n\nSANSA: You said you would protect me.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.\n\nSANSA: I don t believe you anymore. I don t need you anymore. You can t protect me. You won t even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn t I?\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Do you want me to beg for my life? If that s what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do.\n\nSANSA: What if I want you to die here and now?\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Then I will die.\n\nSANSA: You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: I would do anything to undo what s been done to you. I know that I can t. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out.

HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - TRAINING ROOMARYA and the WAIF are dueling with staves atop the sparring platform. They both strike many blows, all of them deflected by the other. The WAIF feigns and trips ARYA with a blow to the back of the legs. ARYA falls to the ground. The WAIF points her staff in ARYA s face.\n\nWAIF: You re not ready. You should go home before it s too late.\n\nThe WAIF begins to walk away. ARYA jumps to her feet. The WAIF turns around and drops her staff, then approaches ARYA. ARYA swings at the WAIF several times, but the WAIF dodges and redirects the blows. The WAIF kicks ARYA in her midsection, sending her off the platform. ARYA hops back on the platform and advances. The WAIF disarms ARYA and punches her multiple times, knocking her off the platform and onto the ground.\n\nWAIF: You ll never be one of us, Lady Stark.\n\nThe Faceless Man taking on the visage of JAQEN H GHAR appears.\n\nJAQEN: She has a point.\n\nJAQEN walks away. ARYA follows. They enter the Hall of Faces.\n\nJAQEN: None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.\n\nARYA: Who was the first?\n\nJAQEN: He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled.\n\nARYA: Where did they go?\n\nJAQEN: Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires.\n\nARYA: A girl has no desires.\n\nJAQEN holds up a small bottle.\n\nARYA: Who?\n\nARYA takes the bottle.\n\nJAQEN: An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall.\n\nCUT TO: BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE\n\nActors are performing a play. An audience has gathered to watch. ARYA is among them. On stage, an actor named IZEMBARO dressed as ROBERT BARATHEON walks back and forth. Two prop men mirror his movements, carrying a tarp that displays a forest landscape. Another prop man carries a cut-out of a boar and rams it into the actor s rear end. The sound man makes a farting noise.\n\nIZEMBARO: Ahh!\n\nARYA laughs along with the crowd. The prop man strikes IZEMBARO with the boar prop again, this time in front. The actor recoils and the prop men replace the forest background with a black background.\n\nIZEMBARO: Oh, murdered by a boar. The great big hairy whore. He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more.\n\nIZEMBARO produces an intestine prop from his garb. He staggers, but is supported by another actor, CLARENZO, portraying JOFFREY.\n\nCLARENZO: Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie. I love you, Father. Please don t die.\n\nIZEMBARO prop slaps CLARENZO. ARYA laughs with the crowd.\n\nIZEMBARO: Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.\n\nThe actor portraying Joffrey falls to his knees in the front of the stage. LADY CRANE, portraying CERSEI, appears on the stage and walks to him.\n\nLADYC RANE: I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it s time to learn to look darkness in the face?\n\nIZEMBARO: Ned stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.\n\nBOBONO, portraying TYRION, appears and fills his glass. CAMELLO, portraying NED, appears and adjusts his crotch.\n\nCAMELLO: Ooh! Ooh, what s happened here, then?\n\nBOBONO: He brought you here, Ned Stark,  cause you re the brightest fellow in the land. You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand.\n\nCAMELLO: We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful.\n\nCAMELLO gestures to IZEMBARO.\n\nCAMELLO: I d ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful.\n\nThe crowd laughs. ARYA looks around at them. She does not laugh.\n\nIZEMBARO: I die! I die! And here I now must lie. Oh, woe. Oh, no. Oh, I am about to go.\n\nThe sound man makes a farting noise.\n\nLADY CRANE: Will you stay on as Joffrey s Hand?\n\nCAMELLO: The Iron Throne s what I demand.\n\nLADY CRANE: You cannot.\n\nCAMELLO: I can.\n\nLADY CRANE: You will not.\n\nCAMELLO: I will.\n\nLADY CRANE: You dare not.\n\nCAMELLO: I dare yes.\n\nLADY CRANE: The line of succession.\n\nCAMELLO: What s that mean?\n\nLADY CRANE: The proper progression.\n\nCAMELLO: What s that mean?\n\nLADY CRANE: The lawful ascension.\n\nCAMELLO: What s that mean?\n\nThe crowd laughs. Music plays. The crowd claps and cheers. The actors change scenes. CLARENZO is sitting on a cut-out of the Iron Throne. LADY CRANE and CAMELLO are standing next to him. BOBONO stands off to the side on a step stool.\n\nCAMELLO: So move along, give me my chair and there won t be no more trouble.\n\nCLARENZO prop slaps CAMELLO. CAMELLO stumbles into the grasp of BOBONO, who sends him to his knees.\n\nCAMELLO: But we had a deal all done and dusted.\n\nTwo prop men carrying spears lift CAMELLO to his feet.\n\nCAMELLO: I m starting to think you can t be trusted.\n\nThe prop men usher CAMELLO offstage. As they change the scene, CLARENZO and LADY CRANE take center stage. LADY CRANE dons CLARENZO with a crown. In a new scene, CAMELLO is on a cut-out chopping block. CLARENZO and LADY CRANE stand to one side, and a prop man dressed as an executioner stands on the other. BIANCA, portraying Sansa, appears.\n\nBIANCA: Save my father.\n\nLADY CRANE: Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.\n\nBIANCA: Save him, please.\n\nLADY CRANE: Show him mercy. Show the people what a good king should be.\n\nCLARENZO: Good people, you may all relax. My father s friend shall be spared the  \n\nThe prop man portraying the executioner swings his axe. CAMELLO ducks behind the chopping block and tosses out a prop head.\n\nBIANCA: Father! No! Oh, father.\n\nBIANCA takes the prop head. The executioner prop man wrenches the head from her grasp and tosses it to the other prop men.\n\nBOBONO: Worry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you ll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position s mine for life. And he s give me permission to take Sansa as my wife.\n\nHe prop slaps CLARENZO in the face.\n\nBOBONO: You ll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.\n\nHe rips open her shirt, exposing her breasts.\n\nBOBONO: So let s forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night.\n\nCUT TO: BACKSTAGE\n\nAll the actors from the play are gathered together, taking a break and attending to their costumes. The director, IZEMBARO, joins them. CLARENZO is examining his penis.\n\nCLARENZO: It s a wart. Two warts. I ve got two fucking warts on my cock.\n\nCAMELLO: Well, don t worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years.\n\nCAMELLO approaches ARYA and tosses her his costume cloak.\n\nCAMELLO: Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me.\n\nIZEMBARO (to BIANCA): You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do.\n\nBIANCA: I had two lines.\n\nIZEMBARO: There are no small parts. You rang very false.\n\nBIANCA: I rang very false?\n\nBOBONO: What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true.\n\nBIANCA slaps BOBONO upside the head.\n\nBIANCA (to IZEMBARO): You weren t complaining about me last night.\n\nBOBONO approaches LADY CRANE.\n\nBOBONO: May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?\n\nLADY CRANE: I m a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we re going to be intimate.\n\nBOBONO: Of course we re going to be intimate.\n\nLADY CRANE: It s only a matter of time.\n\nLADY CRANE uncorks her bottle of rum and pours herself a glass. The holds her drink up to BOBONO.\n\nLADY CRANE: To our children.\n\nBOBONO: May they have your talent.\n\nLADY CRANE: And your filthy mind.\n\nThey clink their glasses together and drink.\n\nCUT TO: HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING ROOM\n\nJAQEN is washing a body. ARYA is standing by.\n\nARYA: A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.\n\nJAQEN looks at ARYA and nods.\n\nARYA: If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall \n\nJAQEN: A girl is not ready.\n\nARYA: She s a good actress.\n\nJAQEN: So a man has heard.\n\nARYA: Seems like a decent woman.\n\nJAQEN: Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?\n\nARYA: No. Who wants her dead?\n\nJAQEN: That does not matter. The price was paid.\n\nARYA: The younger actress. She s jealous because Lady Crane is better.\n\nJAQEN: A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.\n\nARYA: A girl has decided.\n\nJAQEN: A servant does not ask questions.\nINT. GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVEBRAN is clinging to the roots of the tree. His eyes are glazed white.\n\nCUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - UNKNOWN LAND\n\nBRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN are walking together. They approach a weirwood tree encircled by many stones. The stones form a spiral. A Child of the Forest runs between the stones. BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN follow her. They find a group of the Children crouching in a circle, whispering to each other. LEAF stands, carrying a shard of dragonglass. She approaches a man who is bound to the weirwood tree.\n\nMAN: No! No! No!\n\nLEAF slowly drives the shard into the man s heart until it disappears inside his chest. The man s eyes turn blue.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE\n\nLEAF is watching BRAN. BRAN releases the root of the tree and wakes up from his vision.\n\nBRAN: It was you. You made the White Walkers.\n\nLEAF: We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.\n\nBRAN: From whom?\n\nLEAF: From you. From men.\n\nLEAF exits. BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN stare at each other.\nEXT. PYKE - SEASIDE CLIFFSAll the Ironborn are gathered together. YARA, THEON, and AERON stand among them.\n\nAERON: We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?\n\nYARA walks out into the open.\n\nYARA: I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne.\n\nMAN #1: We ve never had a queen. Not once.\n\nYARA: There are many things we ve never done. We ve never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist.\n\nALL: Aye!\n\nYARA: We are a sea people.\n\nALL: Aye!\n\nYARA: Our god is a sea god.\n\nALL: Aye!\n\n\nYARA: When I am queen, we will build a fleet that  \n\nMAN #2: You shall not be queen!\n\nYARA: I am not finished!\n\nMAN #2: Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us. Not when Balon s own male heir has returned.\n\nThe man looks at THEON. THEON emerges from the crowd and turns to face them.\n\nTHEON: I am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.\n\nTHEON points at YARA.\n\nTHEON: And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is.\n\nALL: Aye!\n\nTHEON: She is a reaver!\n\nALL: Aye!\n\nTHEON: She is a warrior!\n\nALL: Aye!\n\nTHEON: She is ironborn!\n\nALL: Aye!\n\nTHEON: We will find no better leader. This is our queen.\n\nTHEON and YARA stare at each other. The men cheer and chant YARA s name.\n\nEURON: I m Euron Greyjoy.\n\nThe men fall silent. EURON appears and walks through the crowd towards YARA and THEON.\n\nEURON: I claim the Salt Throne.\n\nEURON emerges from the crowd and stands before YARA and THEON. He looks at YARA.\n\nEURON: Niece.\n\nEURON looks at THEON and then walks up to him.\n\nEURON: Nephew. Little Theon.\n\nEURON pats THEON on the cheek, then turns to face the crowd.\n\nEURON: Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn t keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.\n\nThe Ironborn laugh. EURON points at YARA.\n\nEURON: Explains why you think a woman can be king.\n\nYARA: When did you return, Uncle?\n\nEURON: A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.\n\nYARA: I m glad you re here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.\n\nThe men murmur to each other.\n\nEURON: I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren t for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn t win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.\n\nTHEON: That would have been hard to do. You weren t here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time.\n\nEURON: Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?\n\nThe Ironborn laugh.\n\nEURON: Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?\n\nTHEON: You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.\n\nEURON: And how will she do that?\n\nYARA: I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.\n\nEURON: Right idea, except I m the one who s going to build the Iron Fleet because I m the one who knows how to use it. I ve been all over the world. I ve seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I m going to build that fleet and I m going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock.\n\nThe Ironborn laugh.\n\nYARA: You re going to seduce the Dragon Queen?\n\n\nEURON: I m not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we re going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn t born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.\n\nThe Ironborn cheer and chant EURON s name. THEON and YARA exchange a glance.\n\nCUT TO: PYKE - BEACH\n\nSeveral Ironborn carrying flags stand on the shore. EURON is kneeling in the water. AERON pushes him underwater. Meanwhile, YARA, THEON, and some Ironborn run through a cave tunnel.\n\nAERON: May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.\n\nTHEON, YARA, and the men with them run out onto a beach and into awaiting rowboats.\n\nAERSON: Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.\n\nEURON drowns.\n\nAERON: Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.\n\nYARA, THEON, and the men board a large ship.\n\nAERON: What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger.\n\nAERON releases his grip on EURON. Two Ironborn carrying EURON onto shore. AERON and the other Ironborn gathered in attendance all stare at EURON. EURON does not move.One man begins to walk closer to him. EURON gags and coughs. He props himself up on his arms and legs, then spits up water and gasps for air. AERON retrieves a crown made of driftwood and places it on EURON s head.\n\nAERON: What is dead may never die.\n\nALL: What is dead may never die.\n\nThe Ironborn cheer. EURON rises to his feet and looks around at the crowd.\n\nEURON: Where are my niece and nephew? Let s go murder them.\n\nEURON leads AERON and the Ironborn up to a seaside cliff. They stare out at the ocean. A fleet of ships is sailing away from Pyke.\n\nAERON: They stole our best ships.\n\nEURON: Won t be enough to save them.\n\nEURON turns to face the Ironborn.\n\nEURON: Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.\nEXT. VAES DOTHRAK - CLIFFSDAENERYS stands at the edge of the cliff, looking out at Vaes Dothrak. She turns to face JORAH and DAARIO, who are standing behind her.\n\nDAENERYS (to JORAH): I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can t take you back and I can t send you away.\n\nDAENERYS approaches JORAH, but he recoils.\n\nJORAH: You must send me away.\n\nJORAH rolls up his sleeve to reveal the greyscale covering his forearm.\n\nDAENERYS: Is there a cure?\n\nJORAH: I don t know.\n\nDAENERYS: How long does it take?\n\nJORAH: I don t know that either. But I ve seen what happens when it goes far enough. I ll end things before that.\n\nDAENERYS begins to cry.\n\nDAENERYS: I m sorry. I m so sorry.\n\nJORAH: Don t be. All I ve ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I ll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi.\n\nJORAH begins to walk away.\n\nDAENERYS: Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal.\n\nJORAH turns back to face DAENERYS. She approaches him.\n\nDAENERYS: You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.\n\nJORAH nods.\n\nDAENERYS: Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side.\n\nCUT TO: VAES DOTHRAK - HORSE GATE\n\nJORAH sits on a horse, watching DAENERYS and DAARIO lead the Dothraki horde out of Vaes Dothrak. He turns his horse around and starts off into the wilderness.\nINT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOMVARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are gathered together. TYRION pours himself a glass of wine and joins them.\n\nVARYS: In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?\n\nGREY WORM: None.\n\nVARYS: And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.\n\nGREY WORM: Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing.\n\nVARYS: So it s safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.\n\nGREY WORM: For now.\n\nVARYS: For now is the best we get in our profession.\n\nTYRION: It s not enough.\n\nVARYS: Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I d say it s a good start.\n\nTYRION: It s not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that.\n\nMISSANDEI: The people know who brought them freedom.\n\nTYRION: Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced.\n\nVARYS: Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?\n\nTYRION: Who said anything about  him ?\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER\n\nTYRION and VARYS stand on the plateau above the audience chamber. A woman stans  at the bottom of the steps, and a man stand a few steps in front of her.\n\nMAN (speaking Valyrian): You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light.\n\nThe man steps aside. KINVARA walks up a few steps.\n\nTYRION (speaking Valyrian): Welcome to Meereen.\n\nKINVARA stops on the middle plateau.\n\nTYRION: That s about the extent of my Valyrian.\n\nKINVARA says nothing.\n\nTYRION: Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.\n\nTYRION looks at VARYS. KINVARA says nothing.\n\nTYRION: The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --\n\nKINVARA: You don t need to persuade me. I came to help.\n\nKINVARA continues up the steps.\n\nKINVARA: Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.\n\nTYRION: Yes.\n\nKINVARA: She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.\n\nTYRION: She did indeed.\n\nKINVARA: Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven t you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away.\n\nTYRION: Ideally we d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.\n\nKINVARA: You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she s gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed.\n\nTYRION: I d settle for obeyed.\n\nKINVARA: I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.\n\nTYRION: That sounds most excellent --\n\nVARYS: A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King s Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he d been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good.\n\nTYRION: We d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.\n\nVARYS: I suppose it s hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn t that the whole point of being a fanatic? You re always right. Everything is the Lord s will.\n\nKINVARA: Everything is the Lord s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.\n\nVARYS: And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?\n\nTYRION: My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.\n\nVARYS nods. KINVARA takes two more steps. She is one step away from TYRION and VARYS.\n\nKINVARA: Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn t be here helping the Lord s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there s still so much you don t know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?\n\nKINVARA approaches VARYS and places her hand on his arm.\n\nKINVARA: Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?\n\nVARYS scrunches up his face and stares at KINVARA. KINVARA smiles.\n\nKINVARA: We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me.\n\nKINVARA turns and walks back down the steps.\nINT. GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVEBRAN lets a handful of sand run through his fingers. He lays back and then looks SUMMER, HODOR, and the THREE-EYED RAVEN. SUMMER and HODOR are sleeping, but the THREE-EYED RAVEN has his eyes open. BRAN picks up a wood chip and throws it at the THREE-EYED RAVEN. The THREE-EYED RAVEN does not stir. BRAN drags himself over to the roots of the tree and takes hold of them. His eyes turn white.\n\nCUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - UNKNOWN LAND\n\nBRAN walks among the spiraling stones surrounding the weirwood tree from before, only now everything is covered in snow. He stares at the tree, then turns around. The army of the undead stands in attendance.\n\nBRAN: What?\n\nBRAN walks towards them, and then among their ranks. They do not react. He inspects several of them as he walks by. On the other side of the army, he finds the Night King and four White Walkers on horseback. The Night King stares at him. BRAN turns around to find the entire army of the undead staring at him. When he turns back around, the Night King is standing right behind him. He recoils, but the Night King grabs his forearm. He screams.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE\n\nBRAN screams as he releases the tree root and the vision ends. MEERA jumps to her feet.\n\nBRAN: He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: He touched you.\n\nLEAF and another Child of the Forest enter.\n\nBRAN: I don t know. He was close, but --\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: He touched you.\n\nBRAN pulls back his sleeve. There is a handprint on his forearm.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: He knows you are here. He ll come for you.\n\nBRAN: But he can t get in.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you.\n\nMEERA: Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.\n\nHODOR: Hodor.\n\nBRAN: I m sorry. I didn t mean to.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: The time has come.\n\nBRAN: The time for what?\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: For you to become me.\n\nBRAN: But am I ready?\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: No.\n\nBRAN s eyes turn white.\nINT. CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALLJON SNOW, SANSA, BRIENNE, DOLOROUS EDD, DAVOS, TORMUND, and MELISANDRE are gathered around a table. A map is spread out on the table with tokens indicating houses laid on its surface.\n\nJON SNOW: We can t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.\n\nDAVOS: Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys.\n\nDAVOS stands and moves some of the tokens to Winterfell.\n\nDAVOS: The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we re not doing so well there.\n\nSANSA: The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.\n\nDAVOS: I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don t think we can count on them either.\n\nSANSA: How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?\n\nDAVOS: Precious little, my lady.\n\nSANSA: My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.\n\nDAVOS: They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They re more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don t want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon s going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it s a fight they can win.\n\nJON SNOW: There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build.\n\nSANSA: The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay s own door.\n\nDAVOS: I don t doubt it. But Jon doesn t have the Stark name.\n\nSANSA: No, but I do.\n\nJON SNOW stares at SANSA.\n\nSANSA: Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark s son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton s. Ant there are also the Tullys. They re not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question.\n\nDAVOS: I didn t know the Tullys still had an army.\n\nSANSA: My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.\n\nJON SNOW: How do you know that?\n\nSANSA: Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.\n\nDAVOS: That s good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side.\n\nSANSA smiles.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY\n\nBRIENNE follows SANSA down the stairs and along a walkway.\n\nBRIENNE: I ve sworn to protect you, my lady.\n\nSANSA: You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.\n\nBRIENNE: We can send the Blackfish a raven.\n\nSANSA: Can t risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.\n\nBRIENNE and SANSA enter SANSA s chamber. BRIENNE closes the door behind them.\n\nSANSA: Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you ll know how to talk to him.\n\nSANSA sits down on her bed.\n\nSANSA: What is it?\n\nBRIENNE: I don t like leaving you here alone.\n\nSANSA: With Jon?\n\nBRIENNE: Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that s understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --\n\nSANSA: Jon isn t Tormund. Jon isn t Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He s my brother. He ll keep me safe. I trust him.\n\nBRIENNE: Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD\n\nSeveral men of the Night s Watch are readying horses. JON SNOW stands beside them. MELISANDRE sits on her horse behind them. BRIENNE walks past. SANSA approaches JON SNOW, carrying a bundled cloak.\n\nJON SNOW: New dress?\n\nSANSA: I made it myself. Do you like it?\n\nJON SNOW: Year, it s -- I like the wolf bit.\n\nSANSA: Good, because I made this for you.\n\nSANSA hands JON SNOW the cloak. JON SNOW looks at it. The direwolf sigil of House Stark is pressed into the leather straps.\n\nSANSA: I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.\n\nJON SNOW: Thank you, Sansa.\n\nSANSA: You re welcome.\n\nSANSA walks away. BRIENNE is sitting on horseback beside TORMUND. TORMUND stares at her. She catches him staring and looks away. He grins. DOLOROUS EDD approaches JON SNOW, who is donning his new cloak.\n\nJON SNOW: Don t knock it down while I m gone.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: I ll do my best.\n\nThey embrace.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: Good luck.\n\nJON SNOW walks to his horse and climbs atop it. He leads SANSA, MELISANDRE, PODRICK, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and the rest of the party out through the southern gates. A man of the Night s Watch approaches DOLOROUS EDD, who is watching them leave.\n\nMAN: Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: I m not the Lord Comman --\n\nThe men of the Night s Watch gather around DOLOROUS EDD.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: Yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.\nINT. GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVEBRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN are both having a vision. MEERA and HODOR are preparing for travel.\n\nMEERA: We can go home now, Hodor. Well, maybe not home home, but somewhere that isn t a cave.\n\nHODOR chuckles.\n\nHODOR: Hodor.\n\nMEERA: Eat something that isn t moss. I want an egg. How do you like  em? Boiled? Fried up with some butter?\n\nHODOR laughs.\n\nHODOR: Hodor.\n\nMEERA: With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.\n\nHODOR: Hodor.\n\nMEERA notices she can see her breath. She looks at BRAN and then runs to the entrance of the cave. LEAF and the other Children of the Forest are gathered outside. Across the field, the Night King, three White Walkers, and the army of the dead are gathered. The Night King steps forward, kneels, and places his hand on the ground. A rift cracks through the ice all across the field and into the Great Weirwood Tree.\n\nLEAF: Get Bran and run!\n\nMEERA runs back into the cave, retrieving a sword on the way back. The Night King unsheathes his blade and leads the White Walkers and the army of the dead towards the Great Weirwood. Inside, MEERA runs to BRAN and shakes him.\n\nMEERA: Bran. Bran, wake up. Bran.\n\nHODOR sits in the corner, rocking back and forth.\n\nHODOR: Hodor. Hodor.\n\nMEERA: Bran, wake up.\n\nCUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL\n\nBRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN watch YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN embrace. BRAN smiles.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE\n\nMEERA hauls the sledge over to BRAN and tries to drag him onto it.\n\nMEERA: Hodor.\n\nHODOR: Hodor. Hodor.\n\nMEERA: Help me!\n\nOutside, LEAF and the Children of the Forest throw magic spheres at the army of the undead. The spheres explode upon contact, killing some of the wights. With one of the last bombs, LEAF lights a half-circle of flame in front of the entrance to the cave. She and the Children of the Forest run inside. The Night King and the White Walkers approach the flame. The flame parts to let them pass, then reforms. The army of the dead cannot pass through the flame. They go around it and climb the crag to the top of the Great Weirwood. Inside, MEERA places BRAN on the sledge.\n\nCUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL\n\nBRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN continue to watch.\n\nRICKARD (to YOUNG NED): Remember that you are a Stark. Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale and try to stay out of fights.\n\nNAN walks over to YOUNG HODOR and takes his arm.\n\nYOUNG NED: Yes, Father.\n\nRICKARD takes YOUNG NED by the chin.\n\nRICKARD: But if you have to fight, win.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE\n\nMEERA continues shaking BRAN.\n\nMEERA: Bran! Bran, wake up!\n\nA wight falls through the ceiling. It advances on MEERA. MEERA grabs her sword and cuts it down. Another wight falls from the ceiling. MEERA recoils. SUMMER tackles it. MEERA drops her blade and returns to BRAN.\n\nMEERA: Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up.\n\nHODOR: Hodor. Hodor.\n\nLEAF enters and runs up to BRAN and MEERA. A third wight falls from the ceiling, suspended upside down by its feet. LEAF rushes over to it and beheads it with her knife.\n\nMEERA: You have to wake up. We need Hodor.\n\nHODOR: Hodor. Hodor.\n\nAnother wight rushes, but LEAF shoots it with an arrow. A Child of the Forest enters to combat another wight, but the wight knocks her down and kills her. LEAF shoots it with an arrow.\n\nHODOR: Hodor.\n\nA number of wights begin piling in. LEAF and the Children of the Forest try to fight them off. One wight kills another Child of the Forest.\n\nMEERA: Bran, we re all going to die!\n\nCUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL\n\nBRAN hears MEERA shouting at him from the other side.\n\nMEERA (V.O.): Bran, wake up! We re all going to die! Bran! Bran!\n\nCUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE\n\nMEERA: Bran, you have to wake up! We need Hodor!\n\nHODOR: Hodor. Hodor.\n\nMEERA: Warg into Hodor now!\n\nCUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL\n\nBRAN looks at YOUNG HODOR and NAN.\n\nMEERA (V.O.): Bran, wake up. We need Hodor. We need Hodor. Warg into Hodor now! Now!\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: Listen to your friend, Brandon.\n\nHODOR (V.O.): Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE\n\nHODOR s eyes flash white. More wights enter the cave. One of them kills another Child of the Forest. MEERA cuts it down. Another Child of the Forest  jumps forward and stabs another wight with a spear. HODOR stands and walks over to BRAN.  A White Walker enters. The spear-bearing Child of the Forest lunges at it and stabs it in the chest, but the blow has no effect. The White Walker pushes the spear aside and stabs the Child of the Forest, killing her. HODOR lifts the sledge with BRAN atop it. MEERA grabs a dragonglass spear and launches it into the White Walker s neck. The White Walker shatters and dies. MEERA and LEAF follow HODOR towards the back entrance. SUMMER growls and bares his teeth at the wights entering the cave.\n\nMEERA: Summer!\n\nLEAF: Go. Go!\n\nLEAF and MEERA run into the back tunnel. SUMMER attacks the wights. The wights encircle him and stab him to death. LEAF, MEERA, and HODOR hurry down the back tunnel. BRAN is still engaged in a vision on the sledge. A slew of wights pursues them. Back in the cave, the Night King enters and approaches the THREE-EYED RAVEN.\n\nCUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: The time has come. Leave me.\n\nBack in the Great Weirwood tree, the Night King slashes the THREE-EYED RAVEN. The THREE-EYED RAVEN dissolves into a black mist in front of BRAN.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - BACK TUNNEL\n\nThe undead army is advancing. LEAF stops running.\n\nMEERA: What are you doing?\n\nLEAF: Go!\n\nLEAF turns to face the undead. She brandishes a magic bomb and primes it. The wights overtake her and knock her to the ground, stabbing her repeatedly. LEAF detonates the bomb, killing herself and the wights surrounding her. HODOR reaches the rear door. He puts down the sledge and begins ramming the door. More wights appear and begin advancing.\n\nMEERA: Hodor, hurry!\n\nHODOR heaves the door open and drags the sledge outside. He drops the sledge and returns to the door, holding it closed. MEERA lifts the sledge and begins dragging it away.\n\nMEERA: Hold the door!\n\nCUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL\n\nBRAN turns and stares at YOUNG HODOR, who stares back at him.\n\nMEERA (V.O.): Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!\n\nYOUNG HODOR s eyes turn white. He falls to the ground and convulses.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - BACK ENTRANCE\n\nHODOR puts his weight against the door.\n\nMEERA: Hold the door!\n\nCUT TO: VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL\n\nYOUNG HODOR continues convulsing.\n\nMEERA (V.O.): Hold the door!\n\nNAN: Wylis! What s the matter?\n\nNAN kneels down beside YOUNG HODOR. BRAN walks over to them.\n\nMEERA (V.O.): Hold the door!\n\nYOUNG HODOR: Hold the door!\n\nIn the present day, HODOR struggles against the door.\n\nYOUNG HODOR: Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!\n\nCUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - BACK ENTRANCE\n\nThe wights begin to break through the door.

CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW S ROOM\n\nLongclaw is lying on a table. DOLOROUS EDD lifts and admires it, then turns to JON SNOW who is putting some items in a bag.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: Where you gonna go?\n\nJON SNOW: South.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: What are you gonna do?\n\nJON SNOW: Get warm.\n\nJON SNOW smiles. DOLOROUS EDD places Longclaw on the table.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: I was with you at Hardhome. We saw what s out there. We know it s coming here. How can you leave us now?\n\nJON SNOW: I did everything I could. You know that.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: You swore a vow.\n\nJON SNOW: Aye, I pledged my life to the Night s Watch. I gave my life.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: For all nights to come.\n\nJON SNOW: They killed me, Edd! My own brothers. You want me to stay here after that?\n\nA single horn sounds outside. JON SNOW and DOLOROUS EDD look to the doorway.\n\nMAN (O.S.): Riders approaching!\n\nMAN #2 (O.S.): Open the gate!\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD\n\nThe southern gates open. SANSA, BRIENNE, and PODRICK enter the courtyard on horseback. The Night s Watch and the Wildlings all watfch them. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. The trio dismount from their horses. JON SNOW and DOLOROUS EDD emerge onto a balcony overlooking the courtyard. SANSA slowly spins around until she and JON SNOW lock eyes. JON SNOW descends from the balcony and walks to SANSA. They stare at each other and then embrace.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW S ROOM\n\nJON SNOW and SANSA are sitting by the fire. SANSA lifts a bowl to her lips and drinks from it.\n\nSANSA: This is good soup. Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?\n\nJON SNOW: With the peas and onions?\n\nSANSA: Mmm.\n\nJON SNOW: We never should have left Winterfell.\n\nSANSA: Don t you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself,  Don t go, you idiot. \n\nJON SNOW: How could we know?\n\nSANSA: I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you. I wish I could change everything.\n\nJON SNOW: We were children.\n\nSANSA: I was awful, just admit it.\n\nJON SNOW chuckles.\n\nJON SNOW: You were occasionally awful. I m sure I can t have been great fun. Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.\n\nSANSA: Can you forgive me?\n\nJON SNOW: There s nothing to forgive.\n\nSANSA: Forgive me.\n\nJON SNOW: All right. All right, I forgive you.\n\nSANSA laughs, then holds out her hand for JON SNOW s horn of ale. JON SNOW gives it to her. She sips, then coughs. JON SNOW laughs.\n\nJON SNOW: You d think after thousands of years, the Night s Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.\n\nSANSA: Where will you go?\n\nJON SNOW: Where will we go? If I don t watch over you, Father s ghost will come back and murder me.\n\nSANSA: Where will we go?\n\nJON SNOW: I can t stay here, not after what happened.\n\nSANSA: There s only one place we can go. Home.\n\nJON SNOW: Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?\n\nSANSA: We ll take it back from them.\n\nJON SNOW: I don t have an army.\n\nSANSA: How many wildlings did you save?\n\nJON SNOW: They didn t come here to serve me.\n\nSANSA: They owe you their lives.\n\nSANSA stands and walks to a table. She places her bowl down on it.\n\nSANSA: You think they ll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?\n\nJON SNOW: Sansa.\n\nSANSA: Winterfell is our home. It s ours and Arya s and Bran s and Rickon s. Wherever they are, it belongs to our family. We have to fight for it.\n\nJON SNOW: I m tired of fighting.\n\nJON SNOW stands and turns to face SANSA.\n\nJON SNOW: It s all I ve done since I left home. I ve killed brothers of the Night s Watch. I ve killed wildlings. I ve killed men that I admire. I hanged a boy younger than Bran. I fought and I lost.\n\nSANSA: If we don t take back the North, we ll never be safe. I want you to help me. But I ll do it myself if I have to.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY\n\nMELISANDRE is looking out over the edge of the balcony. DAVOS approaches her.\n\nDAVOS: My lady.\n\nMELISANDRE: Ser Davos.\n\nDAVOS: Will you stay here at Castle Black?\n\nMELISANDRE: I will do as Jon Snow commands.\n\nDAVOS: You serve Jon Snow now?\n\nMELISANDRE: He s the prince that was promised.\n\nDAVOS: Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis.\n\nMELISANDRE walks away from DAVOS and down into the courtyard. DAVOS follows her.\n\nDAVOS: What happened down there?\n\nMELISANDRE: There was a battle. Stannis was defeated.\n\nMELISANDRE continues to walk away, but DAVOS grabs her arm to stop her.\n\nDAVOS: And Shireen? What happened to the princess?\n\nBRIENNE approaches.\n\nBRIENNE:  I saw what happened. I saw Stannis  forces defeated in the field.\n\nDAVOS: My lady, I m Ser Davos Seaworth.\n\nBRIENNE: We ve met before. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.\n\nBRIENNE stares at MELISANDRE.\n\nDAVOS: That s in the past now.\n\nBRIENNE: Yes, it s in the past. It doesn t mean I forget. Or forgive. He admitted it, you know.\n\nDAVOS: Who did?\n\nBRIENNE: Stannis. Just before I executed him.\n\nBRIENNE walks away. MELISANDRE walks in the opposite direction. DAVOS stares at BRIENNE.\nEXT. EYRIE TRAINING GROUNDS - DAYROBIN is aiming at a target with a bow and arrow. He shoots, but the arrow falls short. YOHN ROYCE sighs to himself. ROBIN looks to YOHN ROYCE for approval. YOHN ROYCE smiles. A carriage approaches, accompanied by several knights. The knight driving the carriages dismouts and extends the carriage steps. LITTLEFINGER emerges from the carriage.\n\nLITTLEFINGER (to ROBIN): The Defender of the Vale!\n\nROBIN: Uncle Petyr!\n\nROBIN drops the bow and arrow and runs to LITTLEFINGER. They embrace.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: My lord. Come and see.\n\nLITTLEFINGER ushers ROBIN to the rear of the carriage.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: I missed your name day. Go on.\n\nROBIN and LITTLEFINGER pull a sheet from the back of the carriage, revealing a cage with a falcon inside. The falcon squawks. ROBIN gasps.\n\nROBIN: A falcon!\n\nLITTLEFINGER: A gyrfalcon. The greatest and rarest of birds.\n\nYOHN ROYCE: Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Indeed I was.\n\nYOHN ROYCE: And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men. Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting.\n\nYOHN ROYCE: Do you take me for a fool?\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else.\n\nThe ensuing conversation momentarily distracts ROBIN from admiring the falcon. YOHN ROYCE approaches LITTLEFINGER slowly.\n\nYOHN ROYCE: Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us. And only his judgment concerns me.\n\nYOHN ROYCE looks to ROBIN.\n\nROBIN: Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?\n\nThe surrounding knights begin to approach YOHN ROYCE. YOHN ROYCE walks closer to ROBIN.\n\nYOHN ROYCE: My lord. My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn. To your father, to your mother, and now to you.\n\nROBIN: Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?\n\nYOHN ROYCE turns back to look at LITTLEFINGER.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Lord Royce has served the Vale well. He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career. If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come.\n\nYOHN ROYCE turns back to ROBIN.\n\nYOHN ROYCE: You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?\n\nROBIN: Fine.\n\nYOHN ROYCE bows and walks a few feet away from the engagement.\n\nLITTLEFINGER (to ROBIN): I bring good news. My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell. I expect she s headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander. But she won t be safe there, not with the Boltons after her.\n\nROBIN: She s my cousin. We should help her.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: That was my instinct as well.\n\nLITTLEFINGER turns and walks towards YOHN ROYCE.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Our lord has spoken. Gather the Knights of the Vale. The time has come to join the fray.\nEXT. MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE - DAYA ship is entering the harbor. TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are standing on the shore watching its approach.\n\nGREY WORM: You invite the enemy into our city?\n\nTYRION: I did. As a clever man once told me,  We make peace with our enemies, not our friends. \n\nTYRION begins walking away. The others follow.\n\nGREY WORM: I don t make peace with the queen s enemies. I kill the queen s enemies.\n\nTYRION: Yes, that s the military approach. And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach.\n\nTYRION and VARYS begin ascending the stairs to the Great Pyramid.\n\nMISSANDEI: Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her.\n\nTYRION and VARYS turn back to face MISSANDEI and GREY WORM.\n\nTYRION We enter these negotiations with open eyes. Trust me. My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution.\n\nMISSANDEI: How many days were you a slave?\n\nTYRION stammers.\n\nTYRION: Long enough to know.\n\nMISSANDEI: Not long enough to understand.\n\nTYRION and VARYS proceed up the steps. MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER\n\nTYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are sitting in attendance to three masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION.\n\nYEZZAN: I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor. And somehow you ve risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen. It s most impressive.\n\nTYRION: And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.Here s to reversals of fortune.\n\nRAZDAL: We came here to meet the queen and instead we re greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.\n\nTYRION: Let s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want.\n\nBELICHO: We want you to leave Slaver s Bay. Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.\n\nTYRION: Queen Daenerys won t stay in Meereen forever. Her path takes her westward.\n\nRAZDAL: When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them.\n\nMISSANDEI: She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains.\n\nRAZDAL: As they have since the dawn of time.\n\nGREY WORM: Not anymore.\n\nYEZZAN: You think you re a free man now? You still follow orders. Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn t mean she s not a master.\n\nTYRION: Friends, friends, friends, please.\n\nGREY WORM stares intently at YEZZAN.\n\nTYRION: There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing. That is the way of the world. I m not here to change the way of the world.\n\nYEZZAN: Slavery is the way of our world.\n\nTYRION: You don t need slaves to make money. There haven t been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you. But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it. So here is the queen s proposal. Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver s Bay time to adjust to the new order.\n\nYEZZAN: What does that mean?\n\nTYRION: Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice.\n\nThe masters look at each others.\n\nTYRION: Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices. In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy.\n\nYEZZAN: We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.\n\nTYRION: Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same. I do hope you accept, my friends. You will not receive a better offer.\n\nTYRION picks up a bell from the table beside him and rings it.\n\nTYRION: Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it. And as a parting gift to our honored guests \n\nThree women enter. Each one sits in the lap of one of the masters.\n\nTYRION: Give freedom a chance. See if it doesn t taste every bit as good as what came before.\n\nTYRION exits. VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM follow.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER\n\nA group of commoner representatives are gathered together at the foot of the throne, whispering in Valyrian. TYRION, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM enter on the throne platform.\n\nTYRION (speaking Valyrian): My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time.\n\nMISSANDEI (to TYRION): Perhaps I should translate for you.\n\nMAN #1: We speak the Common Tongue.\n\nTYRION: Excellent.\n\nMAN #2: You met with the slavers today.\n\nTYRION: I did.\n\nMAN #1: Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum. Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.\n\nTYRION: I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.\n\nTYRION begins to descend the steps towards the men. MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow.\n\nTYRION: But I am not your ruler. I m not the Breaker of Chains. I m not the Unburnt. And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.\n\nTYRION and company reach the bottom of the steps so they are face to face with the men.\n\nMAN #1: You are a stranger here. So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?\n\nTYRION: Because our queen chose me as her advisor. Until she returns from her travels --\n\nMAN #2: When does she return?\n\nTYRION: Soon. You have my word.\n\nMAN #1: We don t know you. We don t trust you. We know Torgo Nudho. We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.\n\nTYRION: And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations. As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace.\n\nMAN #2: You have made peace with the slavers?\n\nTYRION: We offered terms.\n\nMAN #1 (speaking Valyrian): And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers  arms and sold us at auction like cattle?\n\nGREY WORM (speaking Valyrian): I am a soldier, not a politician. But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it.\n\nMAN #2 (speaking Valyrian): Missandei, you know what these men are. How can you trust them?\n\nMISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian): I do not trust them. I will never trust them.\n\nMISSANDEI pauses and looks at TYRION.\n\nMISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian): But as a wise man once said,  We make peace with our enemies, not our friends. \n\nTYRION smiles.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE\n\nTYRION, GREY WORM, and MISSANDEI are walking together.\n\nGREY WORM: Do not use me for your lies.\n\nTYRION: Those men respect you.\n\nGREY WORM: They respect me because they know who I am. They know I am loyal.\n\nTYRION: As do I.\n\nGREY WORM: I am loyal to my queen, not you. If you betray her work, you are my enemy.\n\nTYRION: I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.\n\nMISSANDEI: You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.\n\nTYRION: For a short time.\n\nMISSANDEI: Seven years is not a short time for a slave.\n\nTYRION: You re right. Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once. War is a horror that should be ended at once. I can t do both today.\n\nGREY WORM: You are wrong to trust these men.\n\nTYRION: I don t trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest. They re trustworthy if they re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.\n\nGREY WORM: You don t know them. You don t understand them. We are not human in their eyes. They look at me and see a weapon. They look at her and see a whore.\n\nTYRION: They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast. Their contempt is their weakness. They ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.\n\nGREY WORM: You will not use them. They will use you. That is what they do.\n\nEXT. ESSOS MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY\n\nJORAH and DAARIO are walking to the top of a mountain crag. JORAH lags behind and stops to catch his breath. DAARIO turns back to him.\n\nDAARIO: You all right? Why don t you sit and catch your breath?\n\nJORAH: I m fine.\n\nDAARIO chuckles.\n\nDAARIO: I don t think you could ride the dragon. 20 years ago, maybe.\n\nJORAH: What?\n\nDAARIO: Our queen. She s wild, you know. Don t let her size fool you. It s hard enough for me and I m a young man. You, I don t think your heart could take it.\n\nJORAH stares at DAARIO for a few moments and then continues along the path.\n\nDAARIO: Must make you angry that our queen chose me.\n\nJORAH: Makes me sad. You ll disappoint her before long. She ll move on.\n\nDAARIO: We ll all disappoint her before long.\n\nJORAH turns back to face DAARIO.\n\nJORAH: We need each other right now. After we re done needing each other --\n\nDAARIO: Oh, I don t want to fight you, Jorah the Andal. What do I have to gain? If I win, I m the shit who killed an old man. If I lose, I m the shit who was killed by an old man.\n\nJORAH: You didn t get much discipline as a child, did you?\n\nDAARIO: None.\n\nJORAH and DAARIO crawl to the edge of the ridge and look below. Vaes Dothrak sprawls across the valley floor.\n\nJORAH: The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway.\n\nJORAH points to the eastern division of Vaes Dothrak, and then to the western division.\n\nJORAH: Eastern Market, Western Market. When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals. That s where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.\n\nJORAH stands and walks off to the side. He begins undoing his sword belt.\n\nDAARIO: What are you doing?\n\nJORAH: It s forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.\n\nDAARIO: Isn t it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?\n\nJORAH: If they spot us and we re unarmed, we ll say we re traders heading for the Western Market. But if they see weapons \n\nDAARIO: You re asking a dog to hand over his teeth.\n\nJORAH: There s 100,000 of them down there. We can t fight our way out. We wait till dark, and then we ll find her.\n\nDAARIO hands over his weapons, except for his dagger. JORAH holds his hand out for the dagger.\n\nDARRIO: Uh \n\nDAARIO flips the knife around in his hand.\n\nDAARIO: I m very attached to this knife.\n\nDAARIO kisses and strokes the knife, then motions to hand it to JORAH. He spots the patch of greyscale on JORAH s arm through a hole in his sleeve. JORAH pinches the fabric of his sleeve together to cover up the greyscale.\n\nJORAH: Don t worry. it didn t touch you.\n\nDAARIO: You know what happens?\n\nJORAH: I know what happens.\n\nDAARIO gestures with the dagger.\n\nDAARIO: I ll do it myself.\n\nJORAH walks to the side and stares into space.\n\nCUT TO: VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT\n\nDothraki men and women are celebrating in the streets. JORAH and DAARIO are sneaking through the stables. They crouch down in front of a railing and see a Dothraki man and woman fornicating.\n\nDAARIO: I should have been born a Dothraki.\n\nJORAH and DAARIO sneak into an alleyway. They move through the alley, but spot two Dothraki men coming their way. JORAH grabs DAARIO.\n\nJORAH: Come on.\n\nJORAN and DAARIO walk out to greet the Dothraki men. They proceed to speak in Dothraki.\n\nJORAH: My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost. Could you show us the way back?\n\nDOTHRAKI #1: What do you sell?\n\nJORAH: Wine. Come down to my stall tomorrow, I ll give you a cask of the Arbor s finest.\n\nDOTHRAKI #1: You re not merchants.\n\nThe Dothraki man inclines his head towards his fellow man.\n\nDOTHRAKI #1: Get the others.\n\nThe second Dothraki man runs down the alleyway. DAARIO darts after him. JORAH swings at the first Dothraki man, but misses. The Dothraki man knees him in the face, knocking him to the ground. DAARIO continues to pursue the other Dothraki man. JORAH strikes his foe twice, but both are blocked. The Dothraki man strikes back with a punch to the face that sends JORAH sprawling. In the alley, just before the other Dothraki man reaches the common area, DAARIO grabs him from behind, places his hand over his mouth, and then snaps his neck. JORAH is rebuffed by his foe a third time. He attempts to throw sand in the Dothraki man s face, but he dodges out of the way. JORAH climbs to his knees, but the Dothraki man grabs him by the throat and begins choking him. DAARIO stabs the Dothraki man from behind, killing him.\n\nDAARIO: Told you, I m very attached to this knife.\n\nDAARIO tucks the dagger away in his shirt. JORAH climbs to his feet.\n\nDAARIO: You all right?\n\nJORAH: If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us.\n\nDAARIO grabs a large rock and smashes the dead Dothraki man with it several times.\n\nDAARIO: Huh.\n\nCUT TO: VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN\n\nDAENERYS is sitting among the Dosh Khaleen. The women whisper among themselves, but the leader sits beside DAENERYS. They begin to speak in Dothraki.\n\nLEADER: Some of them don t think Dothraki should breed with foreigners. They are stupid old women. They don t realize that we have always diluted our blood. This one is Lhazareen. Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village. How old were you?\n\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: Twelve.\n\nLEADER: A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter. How did he show his happiness?\n\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: He broke my ribs.\n\nLEADER: We are not queens here, but the khals depend on us for our wisdom. Our lives have meaning.\n\nDAENERYS: That is more than most have.\n\nLEADER: When the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night, I hope they let you live out your days with us. The other possibilities are not so pleasant.\n\nDAENERYS: I need to make water.\n\nLEADER: You can t run from Dothraki. You know this.\n\nDAENERYS: I will never run from Dothraki.\n\nLEADER (to LHAZAREEN WOMAN): Go, show her.\n\nThe Lhazareen woman takes DAENERYS outside the temple. They walk together.\n\nDAENERYS: I needed fresh air. The old women stink.\n\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: They do stink.\n\nDAENERYS: You must have been very young when your Khal died.\n\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: Sixteen.\n\nDAENERYS: Too bad he didn t die sooner.\n\nDAENERYS and the Lhazareen woman smile at each other.\n\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: Yes, too bad.\n\nThe pair round a bend to a secluded desert outcropping.\n\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: Is it true you have three dragons?\n\nDAENERYS: Mm-hmm.\n\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: And they breathe fire?\n\nDAENERYS: They do. Would you like to see them one day?\n\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: I am Dosh Khaleen. I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die.\n\nDAARIO grabs the Lhazareen woman from behind, covers her mouth, and places his dagger against her neck. JORAH is standing behind DAARIO.\n\nDAENERYS: No, don t hurt her.\n\nDAARIO: She ll give us away.\n\nJORAH: We have to go now.\n\nDAENERYS grabs DAARIO s dagger-carrying hand, and he drops it away from the Lhazareen woman s neck.\n\nDAENERYS: We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.\n\nJORAH: All we can do is try.\n\nDAENERYS: No. We can do more than that. And you re going to help me.\n\nDAENERYS looks at the Lhazareen woman.\n\nDAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi. Do not betray me.\n\nThe Lhazareen woman nods. DAENERYS looks at DAARIO. DAARIO slowly removes his hand from her mouth.\nINT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR CELLMARGAERY is sitting in the corner of her cell. SEPTA UNELLA enters, then guides MARGAERY out into the prayer room where the HIGH SPARROW waits. MARGAERY walks into the room and shields her eyes from the sunlight. SEPTA UNELLA pushes MARGAERY to her knees, then exits.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?\n\nMARGAERY: I d go to my brother, my husband, my family.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power. Seeking out your family means seeking out sin. I m not maligning you. I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else. My father was a cobbler. He died with I was young and I took over his shop. He was a simple man and he made simple shoes. But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them. Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time. Time most of all. Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.\n\nMARGAERY: Quality takes time.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Yes. I imagine you ve worn a year of someone s life on your back. The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege. I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself. Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better.\n\nMARGAERY: And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness. Book of the Stranger, verse 25.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: You know The Seven-Pointed Star.\n\nMARGAERY: Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people. You re close. But it wasn t a graveyard. It was a feast. I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all. We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor. I woke before dawn. I could barely stand. Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes. The truth of their bodies laid bare. I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn. And I saw it with perfect clarity. I saw what my sins were. The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position. It was all part of a story. A story I was telling myself about who I was. A collection of lies that would disappear in the light. The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was.\n\nMARGAERY: So what did you do?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: I left to go and find them. I didn t even put on my shoes. I walked out the door and never went back.\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW stands and extends his hand out to MARGAERY.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Come, let s go and see him.\n\nMARGAERY: Who?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Your brother.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR   LORAS  CELL\n\nMARGAERY enters her brother s cell. The door closes and locks behind her. Loras is lying on the floor.\n\nMARGAERY: Loras. Loras.\n\nMARGAERY helps LORAS to his knees. He cries.\n\nMARGAERY: Listen to me. You need to stay strong.\n\nLORAS: I can t stay strong. I never was strong.\n\nMARGAERY: You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family.\n\nLORAS: I don t care about that.\n\nMARGAERY: Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don t care?\n\nLORAS: I just want it to stop. Help me.\n\nMARGAERY: They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That s why he s letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win.\n\nLORAS: Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.\n\nLORAS begins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.\n\nMARGAERY: All right.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP   TOMMEN'S CHAMBER\n\nCERSEI is walking down the hall to TOMMEN s chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.\n\nMAESTER PYCELLE: And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that s the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without.\n\nCERSEI enters the room\n\nCERSEI: What are you doing here?\n\nMAESTER PYCELLE: I am advising the king on our current predicament.\n\nCERSEi: Leave.\n\nMAESTER PYCELL: I am a member of the Small Council. The king s small --\n\nCERSEI: Is this a Small Council meeting?\n\nMAESTER PYCELL: Obviously not. I m here to lend my wisdom and my support.\n\nTOMMEN: Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now.\n\nMAESTER PYCELL: Your Grace.\n\nMAESTER PYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves, he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door.\n\nCERSEI: Since I ve missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things.\n\nTOMMEN: I ve been thinking about the High Sparrow.\n\nCERSEI: As have we all, unfortunately.\n\nTOMMEN: We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can t put her at risk. He s dangerous.\n\nCERSEI takes TOMMEN by the chin.\n\nCERSEI: Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king s own mother?\n\nTOMMEN looks down.\n\nCERSEI: It s all right. It's done. It s in the past. And of course Margaery s safety is paramount.\n\nTOMMEN: You don t like Margaery, do you?\n\nCERSEI: Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone s. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing.\n\nTOMMEN: Mother...there s something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.\n\nCERSEI: You ve spoken with him?\n\nTOMMEN: I promised him I wouldn t tell anyone. If he found out I told --\n\nCERSEI: It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP   SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER\n\nKEVAN and LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.\n\nCERSEI: The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king s orders.\n\nKEVIN and LADY OLENNA stand up.\n\nLADY OLENNA: I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You re not welcome.\n\nCERSEI: You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one s rivals.\n\nLADY OLENNA: My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What s left to work with?\n\nJAIME: Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king s ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.\n\nCERSEI: The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he ll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city.\n\nLADY OLENNA: Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen.\n\nCERSEi: I agree.\n\nJAIME (to KEVAN): You ve got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery s humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody.\n\nKEVAN:  The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen s safety.\n\nJAIME:  You ll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?\n\nKEVAN: No, but if the king should call on me --\n\nJAIME:  The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen s side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?\n\nCERSEI: You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they ve done to your son.  Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?\n\nKEVAN: Of course I want him back.\n\nCERSEI: Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.\n\nKEVAN: If it doesn t go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We ll have civil war. Many will die.\n\nLADY OLENNA: Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.\nEXT. IRON ISLANDS - HARBORTHEON approaches Pyke Castle by boat.\n\nCUT TO: PYKE CASTLE   GREAT HALL\n\nTHEON enters. YARA is sitting by the fire.\n\nYARA: They told me you were home and I didn t believe it.  Theon Greyjoy?  I said.  He s dead. He s been dead a long time.\" He let you go?\n\nTHEON: I escaped.\n\nYARA turns and looks at THEON.\n\nYARA: I can t hear you.\n\nTHEON: I escaped.\n\nYARA stands up and then walks towards THEON.\n\nYARA: Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.\n\nTHEON: I m sorry.\n\nYARA: You were my brother. You re a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me.\n\nTHEON: I know. I know and I m sorry.\n\nYARA: Stop saying that.\n\nTHEON: He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.\n\nYARA: I know.\n\nTHEON: You don t know.\n\nYARA: He send us one of those pieces. That s why I came for you.\n\nTHEON sobs.\n\nYARA: Why did you come here?\n\nTHEON: Where else could I go?\n\nYARA: You heard father was dead and thought you d claim the crown?\n\nTHEON: No, no. I only heard he died after we docked.\n\nYARA: You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?\n\nTHEON: I didn t know.\n\nYARA: You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you ve done?\n\nTHEON: I don t want to be king.\n\nYARA: What do you want?\n\nTHEON: I should ve listened to you. You re the only one --\n\nYARA: That doesn t matter anymore. Stop crying.  Look at me. Tell me what you want.\n\nTHEON: You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.\n\nINT. WINTERFELL   ROOM\n\nRAMSAY peels an apple with a knife. The door opens. A guard ushers OSHA into the room. RAMSAY nods. The guard leaves and closes the door.\n\nRAMSAY: They've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?\n\nOSHA: A lord?\n\nRAMSAY: Yes. A lord. You ve seen my banners?\n\nOSHA: The flayed man.\n\nRAMSAY: Does that worry you at all?\n\nOSHA: You eat them after?\n\nRAMSAY: No.\n\nOSHA: Then I ve seen worse.\n\nRAMSAY peels the skin of the apple and puts it on the table with the knife. OSHA looks at the knife.  RAMSAY waves for OSHA to come to him. She walks towards him.\n\nRAMSAY: You served the Starks?\n\nOSHA: Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I ve served them.\n\nRAMSAY: The Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon.\n\nOSHA:  He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didn t get no wages. Way I see it, I m owed.\n\nRAMSAY: Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He s mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?\n\nOSHA: I can give you what you want.\n\nRAMSAY: Are you sure you know what that is?\n\nOSHA comes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.\n\nOSHA: Same thing men always want. And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.\n\nOSHA slowly begins to reach for the knife on the table.\n\nRAMSAY: You re a good talker.\n\nRAMSAY grabs OSHA by her hair and yanks her head back.\n\nRAMSAY: I like that.\n\nRAMSAY kisses OSHA'S neck. She reaches into his pants.\n\nRAMSAY: You re a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.\n\nOSHA: That so?\n\nRAMSAY: I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.\n\nOSHA's hand inches closer to the knife.\n\nRAMSAY: He told me everything. All about the Stark boys. Who helped them escape, and how she did it.\n\nOSHA gets up and tries to stab RAMSAY with the knife, but RAMSAY stabs her in the neck first. She falls on the ground, with blood running from her neck. She dies. RAMSAY cleans his knife and continues to peel the apple. He bites a piece.\n\nEXT. CASTLE BLACK   COURTYARD\n\nMAN: Open the gate!\n\nThe gate opens and a knight from the Bolton family enters.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK   MESS HALL\n\nSANSA, JON SNOW, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and DOLOROUS EDD are eating at a table. SANSA looks at the meat on her fork. JON SNOW, DOLOROUS EDD, and TORMUND eat vigorously. BRIENNE looks around at the men eating. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks away. TORMUND smiles. DOLOROUS EDD notices their interaction.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD (to SANSA): Sorry about the food. It s not what we re known for.\n\nSANSA: That s all right. There are more important things.\n\nA Night's Watchman enters the room and holds out a scroll to JON SNOW.\n\nMAN: A letter for you, Lord Commander.\n\nJON SNOW: I m not Lord Commander anymore.\n\nJON SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.\n\nJON SNOW: \"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.\n\nJON SNOW looks at SANSA.\n\nJON SNOW: His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --\n\nSANSA: Go on.\n\nJON SNOW: It's just more of the same.\n\nJON SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading.\n\nSANSA: \"You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.\n\nJON SNOW: Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.\n\nSANSA: His father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.\n\nJON SNOW: We don t know that.\n\nSANSA: Yes, we do.\n\nTORMUND: How many men does he have in his army?\n\nSANSA: I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis s attack.\n\nJON SNOW (to TORMUND): How many do you have?\n\nTORMUND: That can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people.\n\nSANSA (to JON SNOW): You're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They ll fight for you if you ask.\n\nSANSA takes JON SNOW's hand.\n\nSANSA: A monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.\n\nJON SNOW nods.\n\nINT. VAES DOTHRAK   TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN\n\nAll the khals are gathered in council. They speak in Dothraki.\n\nKHAL MORO: It is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city. It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.\n\nKHAL #1: So we don t spill blood.\n\nKHAL MORO: Well  there s always a little blood.\n\nKHAL #1: Someone crushed his head with a rock.\n\nKHAL MORO: Aggo belonged to my khalaser. He served me well. He got his head smashed in by a rock. Fuck Aggo.\n\nKHAL #1 sits down.\n\nKHAL MORO: Bring in Drogo s widow.\n\nDAENARYS enters, ushered by the Lhazareen woman and the leader of the Dosh Khaleen. The khals bow their heads.\n\nKHAL #2: Who cares about her? She s a midget.\n\nKHAL #1: I like her.\n\nKHAL #2: She s paler than milk.\n\nKHAL #3: I d like to know what a khaleesi tastes like.\n\nKHAL #1: Good. You can suck my dick.\n\nThe Khals laugh.\n\nKHAL MORO: She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.\n\nKHAL #4: The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They re offering ten thousand horses In exchange. What's worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?\n\nKHAL MORO: Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses. I ll take their horses for myself.\n\nDAENERYS: Don t you want to know what I think?\n\nAll the khals raise their heads and stare at DAENERYS\n\nKHAL MORO: You d rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you d like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?\n\nDAENERYS: No. I don t want either of those things.\n\nKHAL MORO: We don t care what you want. This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen. Which you are not, until we decide you are.\n\nDAENERYS: I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.\n\nKHAL MORO: And what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo.\n\nDAENERYS: This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.\n\nKHAL MORO: And you were dumb enough to believe him?\n\nDAENERYS: And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you ll raid, how many girls you ll get to fuck, how many horses you ll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will.\n\nThe khals laugh.\n\nKHAL MORO: All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead we ll take turns fucking you. And then we ll let our bloodriders fuck you.\n\nKHAL MORO stands.\n\nKHAL MORO: And If there s anything left of you, we ll give our horses a turn. You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you?\n\nDAENERYS lays her hand on a fire pit.\n\nDAENERYS: You re not going to serve. You re going to die.\n\nDAENERYS knocks down all the fire pits one by one. The khals cower away from the flame. The flame begins to cover the entire temple. The khals run to the door and try to escape, but the door has been barred. JORAH and DAARIO watch the temple burning from the outside. The Dothraki people gather around the burning temple. DAENERYS grabs the final fire pit and knocks it in KHAL MORO's direction. The fire engulfs the entire temple and kills all the khals. DAENERYS walks out of the fire, unharmed and naked. All the Dothraki bow to DAENERYS. JORAH and DAARIO walk up to the steps burning temple. JORAH bows to DAENERYS. DAARIO stares at her and then bows.\nCREDITS\n\n", "episode_53": "\n\nTITLE SEQUENCEINT. CASTLE BLACK ROOMDAVOS is staring at JON SNOW. JON SNOW slowly sits up on the table, breathing heavily. He turns his head to look at DAVOS. GHOST is standing in front of JON SNOW, also staring at him. JON SNOW looks down at his body and sees his stab wounds. He begins gasping and shaking. DAVOS takes off his cloak and rushes over to JON SNOW. JON SNOW attempts to stand but falters. DAVOS catches JON SNOW and wraps him in his cloak.\n\nDAVOS: Easy, easy. Easy.\n\nDAVOS ushers JON SNOW back into a sitting position. MELISANDRE enters and stares at JON SNOW.\n\nDAVOS: What do you remember?\n\nJON SNOW: They stabbed me. Olly...he put a knife in my heart. I shouldn t be here.\n\nDAVOS: The lady brought you back.\n\nMELISANDRE approaches JON SNOW and kneels in front of him.\n\nMELISANDRE: Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go? What did you see?\n\nJON SNOW: Nothing. There was nothing at all.\n\nMELISANDRE: The Lord let you come back for a reason. Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be.\n\nDAVOS (to MELISANDRE): Could you give us a moment?\n\nMELISANDRE rises and exits the room. DAVOS closes the door behind her, grabs a stool, and sits down in front of JON SNOW.\n\nDAVOS: You were dead. And now you re not. That s completely fucking mad, seems to me. I can only imagine how it seems to you.\n\nJON SNOW: I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. And now I m back. Why?\n\nDAVOS: I don t know. Maybe we ll never know. What does it matter? You go on. You fight for as long as you can. You clean up as much of the shit as you can.\n\nJON SNOW: I don t know how to do that. I thought I did, but...I failed.\n\nDAVOS: Good. Now go fail again.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD\n\nDOLOROUS EDD, TORMUND, the faithful Night s Watch members, and the Wildlings are all gathered in the courtyard, staring up at the entrance to the room JON SNOW was in.

The men on either side part to let him pass. TORMUND walks up the middle to confront JON SNOW.\n\nTORMUND: They think you re some kind of god. The man who returned from the dead.\n\nJON SNOW: I m not a god.\n\nTORMUND: I know that.\n\nTORMUND moves closer to JON SNOW and whispers in his ear.\n\nTORMUND: I saw your pecker. What kind of god would have a pecker that small?\n\nJON SNOW and TORMUND both chuckle and embrace. JON SNOW winces, then spies DOLOROUS EDD and begins walking towards him. They embrace, and JON SNOW winces again.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: Your eyes are still brown. Is that still you in there?\n\nJON SNOW: I think so. Hold off on burning my body for now.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD laughs.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: That s funny. You sure that s still you in there?\n\nBoth men laugh.\nEXT. VESSEL ON NARROW SEA - NIGHTA storm is raging, causing rough wind and water to buffet the vessel back and forth. GILLY peers out at the storm through a window in the hull of the ship and smiles.\n\nCUT TO: VESSEL - HOLD\n\nGILLY is sitting on the edge of a cot with LITTLE SAM. Various crewmembers are going about their business. SAMWELL is huddled over a bucket, quivering. He groans and gags. GILLY approaches him.\n\nGILLY: You all right?\n\nSAMWELL: Yes. Yes, I m fine.\n\nGILLY: Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?\n\nSAMWELL: I don t think so.\n\nGILLY: Sea, see. They re spelled different, but they sound the same.\n\nSAMWELL: Yeah, they do.\n\nGILLY: It was before I learned how to read, obviously.\n\nSAMWELL scrunches up his face.\n\nGILLY: Sam, are you going to be sick?\n\nSAMWELL shakes his head and then vomits into the bucket. GILLY retrieves a water skin and hands it to SAMWELL. He washes out his mouth with water.\n\nGILLY: Won t be long. We ll be in the south soon. I m excited to see Oldtown. Captain says it s the most beautiful city in Westeros. Are you going to vomit again?\n\nSAMWELL: No. No, no, no. The Citadel doesn t admit women. There won t be a place for you there or for Little Sam.\n\nGILLY: I stayed at Castle Black. There s no women allowed there.\n\nSAMWELL: The Citadel isn t Castle Black. I don t have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules.\n\nGILLY: I ll stay in Oldtown, then.\n\nSAMWELL: By yourself? With a baby and no money?\n\nGILLY stands.\n\nGILLY: So if we re not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?\n\nSAMWELL: To my home. Horn Hill. My father s -- well, my father, but my mother s a kind woman and my sister s lovely. They ll take care of you both.\n\nGILLY:  Wherever you go, I go, too.  That s what you said.\n\nGILLY returns to LITTLE SAM and sits down on the cot. SAMWELL rises and follows her.\n\nSAMWELL: I said that because I want you and Little Same to be safe. That s all I want -- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you ll be safe\n\nGILLY: Us and everyone else in the world.\n\nSAMWELL: I don t care about them. Well, no, I do, but I don t really. I care about you and him.\n\nGILLY: I know that, Sam. And he does, too. You're the only one who ever has.\n\nGILLY places her hand on SAMWELL s back.\n\nGILLY: If you think it s for the best, we trust you.\n\nSAMWELL: I d feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.\n\nGILLY: I d never do that to the father of my son.\n\nSAMWELL smiles and looks at LITTLE SAM, then vomits into a bucket and coughs.\nEXT. VISION OF THE PAST - TOWER OF JOYNED STARK rides towards the Tower of Joy with six companions. One of the companions is HOWLAND REED.  Two Kingsguard are sitting at the foot of the tower, one of which is ARTHUR DAYNE.When they see the horses approaching, they retrieve their gear and walk out to meet them. BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN are standing on an outcropping, watching events unfold. NED dismounts his horse.\n\nBRAN: That s my father.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: The man beside him is Howland Reed, Meera s father.\n\nThe Kingsguard walk past BRAN and THREE-EYED RAVEN.\n\nBRAN: Ser Arthur Dayne.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: The Sword of the Morning.\n\nBRAN: Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.\n\nNED and his companions confront the Kingsguard. ARTHUR stabs his sword into the dirt.\n\nARTHUR: Lord Stark.\n\nNED: I looked for you on the Trident.\n\nARTHUR: We weren t there.\n\nKINGSGUARD: Your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been.\n\nNED: The Mad King is dead. Rhaegar lies beneath the ground. Why weren t you there to protect your prince?\n\nARTHUR: Our prince wanted us here.\n\nNED: Where s my sister?\n\nARTHUR: I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.\n\nARTHUR and the other Kingsguard put on their helmets.\n\nARTHUR: And now it begins.\n\nThe Kingsguard draw their blades.\n\nNED: No. Now it ends.\n\nNED and his men draw their blades and attack. ARTHUR cuts down HOWLAND. The other Kingsguard runs one of NED s men through with his sword. NED engages in single combat with the other Kingsguard and stabs him through the throat. NED and his three remaining men surround ARTHUR. NED and his men attack all at once, but ARTHUR deflects all of their blows repeatedly, then repositions himself. He kills one of NED s men with a downward strike from both of his blades. NED and the two remaining men advance on ARTHUR. ARTHUR deflects their blows again and slices the throat of another man, then runs another through with his blade. NED engages ARTHUR in single combat.\n\nBRAN: He s better than my father.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: Far better.\n\nBRAN: But Father beat him.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: Did he?\n\nBRAN: I know he did. Heard the story a thousand times.\n\nARTHUR traps NED s blade and wrenches it from his hands. ARTHUR makes a motion to strike NED down, but HOWLAND stabs ARTHUR in the back. ARTHUR falls to his knees.\n\nBRAN: He stabbed him in the back.\n\nNED retrieves a sword and slashes ARTHUR with it, killing him. A woman screams from the Tower and NED storms towards it.\n\nBRAN: What s in the tower?\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: That s enough for one day. We ll visit again another time.\n\nBRAN: I want to see where he s going.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: Time to go.\n\nBRAN: Father!\n\nNED stops on the stairs and turns around in the direction of BRAN s yelling but sees nothing and proceeds up the stairs. BRAN chases after him but is intercepted by the THREE-EYED RAVEN, who touches him on the shoulder.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE\n\nThe white leaves BRAN s eyes as the vision fades. The THREE-EYED RAVEN is tangled in his roots. A child of the forest looks on. BRAN crawls towards the THREE-EYED RAVEN.\n\nBRAN: Why did you do that? Take me back there. I want to go back.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: No.\n\nBRAN: He heard me.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: Maybe. Maybe he heard the wind.\n\nBRAN: He heard me.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: The past is already written. The ink is dry.\n\nBRAN: What s in that tower? I want to go back there.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: I ve told you many times, stay too long where you don t belong and you will never return.\n\nBRAN: Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?\n\nBRAN: So why did you?\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: I was waiting for you.\n\nBRAN: I don t want to be you.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: I don t blame you. You won t be here forever. You won t be an old man in a tree. But before you leave, you must learn.\n\nBRAN: Learn what?\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: Everything.\nEXT. VAES DOTHRAK - DAYDAENERYS is entering Vaes Dothrak with the horde. A mounted Bloodrider ushers her onward with a nudge of his foot.\n\nBLOODRIDER (speaking Dothraki):  Hey, Great Khaleesi. Move your ass.\n\nDAENERYS approaches a domed structure. KHAL MORO and two of his Bloodriders are waiting for atop their horses.\n\nKHAL MORO: Welcome home, Khaleesi.\n\nAnother Bloodrider ushers DAENERYS into the building. Inside, DAENERYS stands in front of a platform atop which a middle-aged Dothraki woman is standing. A group of younger Dothraki women encircle DAENERYS. They speak in Dothraki.\n\nDOTHRAKI WOMAN: Go.\n\nThe Bloodriders who ushered DAENERYS in exit. The older Dothraki woman nods to the younger women, who swarm DAENERYS and remove all of her clothing.\n\nDAENERYS: What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!\n\nOne of the younger woman approaches DAENERYS with a simple brown garment, which DAENERYS takes and wears.\n\nDAENERYS: You have made a mistake. One you will regret. I am the wife of the Great Khal.\n\nDOTHRAKI MATRON: We know who you are. I remember you eating the stallion s heart. Why didn t you come to us after Khal Drogo died?\n\nDAENERYS: Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons. My place is not here with you.\n\nDOTHRAKI MATRON: You were the wife of the Great Khal. You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side. He didn t. I was the wife of the Great Khal. Khal Savo. I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side. You re young. We were all young once. But we all understand the way things are. You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us.\n\nDAENERYS: Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.\n\nDOTHRAKI MATRON: Yes. Immediately after the death of their khal. But you went out into the world. That is forbidden. All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven. They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved. And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo s silver-haired widow. With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons. It is the best you can hope for, now.\nINT. MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOMVARYS is sitting on the steps of the throne, fanning himself. Several Unsullied stand around the perimeters of the room.\n\nVARYS (to an Unsullied): I don t know how you stand it in all that leather.\n\nTwo Unsullied usher a woman into the room.\n\nVARYS: If we could have the room.\n\nAll the Unsullied guards exit.\n\nVARYS: You look lovely today, my dear. You really do. How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat.\n\nWOMAN: If you re going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it.\n\nVARYS: I am not a torturer.\n\nVARYS stands.\n\nVARYS: Though it so often is what people deserve.\n\nVARYS approaches the woman.\n\n\nVARYS: And it does provide answers. But they re usually the wrong answers. My job is to find the right answers. Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy. I d like to make you happy, Vala. That s your name, isn t it, Vala?\n\nVALA looks away. VARYS chuckles.\n\nVARYS: That s all right. I know who you are and what you ve done. You ve done a lot. You ve sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do. And you ve helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.\n\nVALA: The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history.\n\nVARYS: I understand. Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective. I have a different perspective, of course. I think it s important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours. Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy. That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I m afraid I don t really speak the language. Such a handsome boy. Those big, brown eyes. Good luck keeping the ladies away.\n\nVALA: Yes, you re a true liberator, aren t you? You won t torture me, you ll just threaten my son.\n\nVARYS: Children are blameless. I have never hurt them. Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you. But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen s soldiers. We both know the penalty for that crime. How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem.\n\nVALA: If I tell you anything, they ll kill me. So either you kill me or they do.\n\nVARYS: Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem. There is a third option, though. A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos. I ve already booked passage for a woman and her young son. I ll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again.\n\nVARYS kicks a large brown bag at his feet.\n\nVARYS: Though I m afraid we ll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it. Far too heavy for me. The boat sails at dawn. You need to decide now. A new life for you and Dom or \n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER\n\nTYRION, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are sitting together around a table. TYRION smiles at MISSANDEI, and MISSANDEI smiles back. TYRION smiles at GREY WORM, and GREY WORM remains expressionless.\n\nTYRION: What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?\n\nMISSANDEI and GREY WORM look at each other, then at TYRION.\n\nTYRION (to MISSANDEI): You speak 19 languages. You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.\n\nMISSANDEI says nothing.\n\nTYRION: You two, you spend a great deal of time together. What would you be talking about if I weren t here?\n\nGREY WORM: Patrol. When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied. What we see on patrol. Who we captured on patrol.\n\nTYRION: That s good. That s very good.\n\nTYRION stands and carries his wine glass over to the decanter to refill it.\n\nTYRION: But that s a report. I was thinking more of a conversation. A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms.\n\nMISSANDEI: Who said this?\n\nTYRION: Me. Just now. All right, no conversations. Let s play a game.\n\nTYRION returns to the table. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI say nothing.\n\nTYRION: You don t play games, either one of you, ever?\n\nGREY WORM: Games are for children.\n\nMISSANDEI: My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.\n\nTYRION: There, that s a start.\n\nMISSANDEI: Only the girls.\n\nTYRION: Oh no, no, no. Not that, of course not that. Innocent games, fun games, drinking games.\n\nMISSANDEI: We do not drink.\n\nTYRION: Until you do.\n\nGREY WORM and MISSANDEI look interrogatively at TYRION.\n\nTYRION: Alright. No drinking. We can play without drinking. It s a wonderful game. I invented it. Here s how it works. I make a statement about your past. If I m wrong, I drink. And if I m right -- Maybe we can t play without drinking.\n\nVARYS enters the room.\n\nTYRION: Oh, you took your time.\n\nVARYS: Sorry. I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy. Some things you can t rush.\n\nMISSANDEI: You found out?\n\nVARYS: The good masters of Astapor. And the wise masters of Yunkai. With help from their friends in Volantis.\n\nTYRION: You see? You don t even have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.\n\nGREY WORM: We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once. We will do it again and execute the Masters.\n\nTYRION: If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?\n\nGREY WORM: If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?\n\nMISSANDEI: We cannot. The Masters only speak one language. They spoke it to me for many years. I know it better than my mother tongue. If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them. May it be the last thing they ever hear.\n\nTYRION nods.\n\nTYRION: You may be right.\n\nGREY WORM: So we will fight them?\n\nTYRION: Possibly.\n\nMISSANDEI: Possibly?\n\nTYRION: It s a conversation.\n\nTYRION turns to VARYS.\n\nTYRION: Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis?\n\nVARYS: Of course. Man can be fickle, but birds always trust.\n\nINT. RED KEEP - VAULTS\n\nA group of Varys' child spies are gathered together. One LITTLE BIRD picks up a model of a planet. Another child plays with an hourglass.\n\nQYBURN: Your eye looks much better, Arthur. How s your mother s jaw?\n\nARTHUR: Better.\n\nQYBURN: And your father?\n\nARTHUR: No one s seen him.\n\nQYBURN: And no one will. That worked out rather nicely.\n\nLITTLE BIRD: Will Lord Varys ever come back?\n\nQYBURN: I don t think so. Do you miss him?\n\nLITTLE BIRD: He was nice.\n\nARTHUR: He called us his little birds. He gave us sweets.\n\nQYBURN stands up and walks to a table.\n\nQYBURN: It s funny you should mention that. Guess what I happened to find today. Candied plums from Dorne.\n\nHe nods at the boxes. Eeach child picks one. They nibble at the plums.\n\nQYBURN: Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me. All I need in return are whispers.\n\nThe door opens. GREGOR walks in, followed by JAIME and CERSEI.\n\nQYBURN: No need to be afraid. This is Ser Gregor. He s friends with all my friends.\n\nGREGOR looks at the children. They stare at him, motionless.\n\nQYBURN: Run along now.\n\nThe children run up the stairs.\n\nCERSEI: Varys's little birds?\n\nQYBURN: Your little birds now, your Grace.\n\nJAIME is admiring GREGOR.\n\nJAIME: What did you do to him exactly? I haven't been able to get a clear answer.\n\nQYBURN: Oh, a number of things.\n\nJAIME: Does he understand what we re saying? I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place.\n\nGREGOR turns his head to JAIME. JAIME recoils.\n\nQYBURNS: He understands well enough.\n\nJAIME: So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow s head like a melon.\n\nCERSEI: The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him. Ser Gregor will can t face them all. And he won t have to. He ll only have to face one.\n\nJAIME: Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?\n\nCERSEI: Not yet.\n\nJAIME: That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.\n\nCERSEI (to QYBURN): Don t stop at the city. I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North. If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it. If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear. I want to know who they are. I want to where they are.\n\nQYBURN bows his head to CERSEI.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER\n\nKEVAN LANNISTER chairs a meeting of the Small Council. MAESTER PYCELLE, MACE TYRELL and LADY OLENNA have all gathered around him.\n\nMAESTER PYCELLE: As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse. I told them all. I told them. He s arrogant, dangerous. You don t get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason. And no one listened to my advice, so here we are.\n\nJAIME, CERSEI and SER GREGOR enter the room.\n\nMAESTER PYCELLE: And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination. We never sanctioned this, this experiment. And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --\n\nMAESTER PYCELLE notices the new guests. He farts.\n\nKEVAN: Can I help you?\n\nCERSEI (to LADY OLENNA): Why are you here?\n\nMACE TYRELL: My mother...\n\nLADY OLENNA: I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen s imprisonment.\n\nCERSEI: Thank you for bringing it up. It s well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.\n\nLADY OLENNA: Margaery is the queen. You are not the queen because you re not married to the king. I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.\n\nKEVAN (to CERSEI & company): This is a Small Council meeting. You have no position on the Small Council.\n\nJAIME: I m Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council.\n\nCERSEI: Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?\n\nMAESTER PYCELLE: Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King s council. Of course, that was the Mad King. King Robert saw things differently.\n\nJAIME pushes two chairs to the table. JAIME and CERSEI sit down. MAESTER PYCELLE keeps his mouth. The members of the Council look at JAIME and CERSEI.\n\nCERSEI (to KEVAN): What about Myrcella s death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?\n\nJAIME: The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne. We've got a lot to discuss. All of us together.\n\nCERSEI: And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it.\n\nKEVAN: No, we cannot make you leave. And you cannot make us stay. Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all.\n\nOne by one, KEVAN LANNISTER, LADY OLENNA and MACE TYRELL leave the room. MAESTER PYCELLE picks up his paperwork and shuffles slowly. He then runs out of the door when SER GREGOR looks at him threateningly. JAIME, CERSEI and SER GREGOR are left alone in the room.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW is praying. TOMMEN enters the room with his guards. The HIGH SPARROW stands up.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Oh, your Grace.\n\nTOMMEN: My mother would like to see her daughter s final resting place.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace. That s not possible. Not yet.\n\nTOMMEN: When will it be possible?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: When she's fully atoned for her sins.\n\nTOMMEN: You ve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city. That wasn t a full atonement?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: No. She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins.\n\nTOMMEN: I want you to let her see Myrcella s resting place.\n\nSeveral Faith Militant gather behind the HIGH SPARROW.\n\nTOMMEN: I am the king.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: You are.\n\nTOMMEN: And what does that mean to you?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: It means a great deal to me. The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world. Do you know who told me that? Your mother.\n\nTOMMEN walks closer to the HIGH SPARROW. He guards tense.\n\nTOMMEN: My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you ve put her through?\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW signs that his guards need to leave. They leave. TOMMEN puts his hand in the air and points to his guards. They leave. HIGH SPARROW closes the book lying on the table behind him.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother s presence? It was through their own mothers. There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that. But when she speaks of you, the Mother s love outshines it all. Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world. Because it doesn t come from this world. But you know that. You ve felt it. You ve seen her when she talks to you.\n\nTOMMEN: Yes.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: It s a great gift. One I never had. Envy. One more thing for me to atone for.\n\nHIGH SPARROW points to a bench in the room.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees.\n\nTOMMEN: Of course.\n\nHIGH SPARROW sighs and sits down.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you.\n\nTOMMEN: I still don t understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: It s not what I want. It s what the gods want. They make their will known to us and it s up to us to either accept or reject it.\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW palms the seat next to him.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Please.\n\nTOMMEN sits down next to him.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: If we re to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings. A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can. And no one is wiser than the gods.\n\nTOMMEN: My grandfather once said something similar. Except for the part about the gods.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not. As they work through your mother. There s so much good in all of us. The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.\n\nINT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE\n\nThe WAIF and ARYA are standing on a raised platform. The WAIF scrapes her staff on the floor around ARYA, then pushes the end of it against ARYA's head. ARYA turns around. The WAIF nudges her and she flinches. Cut to the WAIF and ARYA sitting on the ground across from each other.\n\nWAIF: Who are you?\n\nARYA: No one.\n\nThe WAIF hits ARYA with a stick. ARYA falls on the ground but gets up.\n\nWAIF: Who were you before you came here?\n\nARYA: Arya Stark.\n\nCut to ARYA and the WAIF on the combat platform.  ARYA tries to fight but the WAIF beats her. ARYA falls to the ground. Her mouth's bleeding. Cut back to the WAIF and ARYA sitting across from each other.\n\nWAIF: Tell me about Arya Stark s family.\n\nARYA: Her father was Eddard Stark. Her mother was Catelyn Stark. She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers.\n\nThe WAIF corrects her with a whip of the stick. Cut to the fighting platform. The WAIF kicks ARYA's staff back into her grasp. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.\n\nARYA: Three brothers.\n\nCut back to the fighting platform. As ARYA speaks each of her brothers' names, the WAIF strikes her.\n\nARYA (V.O.): Rob, Bran, Rickon. And a half-brother, Jon.\n\nWAIF: And where are they now?\n\nCut to ARYA standing in front of a small table. Several bowls are filled with powder. A glass bottle stands behind each bowel.\n\nARYA (V.O.): They may be dead for all a girl knows.\n\nARYA sniffs one of the bowls of powder, then recoils. She sniffs another bowl and wafts the scent with her hand. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.\n\nWAIF: Tell me about The Hound.\n\nCut back to the fighting platform.\n\nARYA (V.O.): Also dead.\n\nARYA deflects several of the WAIF's blows, but is pushed to the edge of the platform and falls when the WAIF smacks her across the face with her staff.\n\nARYA: Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.\n\nCut to the pair sitting across from each other. The WAIF smacks ARYA with the stick.\n\nARYA: He was not on her list anymore. She d taken him off it.\n\nWAIF: Why? Didn t she want him dead any longer?\n\nCut back to the power table.\n\nARYA: She did and she did not.\n\nARYA lifts a spoon of the powder to the jar behind it. The Faceless Man, taking on the form of JAQEN H'GHAR, looks on. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.\n\nWAIF: She sounds confused.\n\nARYA: Yes, she was.\n\nCut back to the powder table. ARYA dumps the spoonful of powder in the bottle. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.\n\nWAIF: Who else was on Arya Stark s funny little list?\n\nCut back to the fighting platform. The WAIF beats down ARYA repeatedly until ARYA can no longer get up.\n\nARYA (V.O.): Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey.\n\nThe WAIF walks away from ARYA, but stops when ARYA begins to stand up. The WAIF turns back to face ARYA.\n\nWAIF: That s a short list. That can t be everyone you want to kill.\n\nARYA stands up and holds her staff out at the WAIF. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.\n\nWAIF: Are you sure you re not forgetting someone?\n\nARYA: Which name would you like a girl to speak?\n\nCut back to the fighting platform. ARYA and the WAIF exchange blows, but ARYA knocks back the WAIF. JAQN H'GHAR looks on.The WAIF returns with a heavy blow, but ARYA blocks it. The WAIF walks away. ARYA turns to face JAQEN H'GHAR.\n\nCUT TO: HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER\n\nARYA is sitting in front of a fireplace. JAQEN is standing in front of the well in the center of the room.\n\nJAQEN: If a girl tells me her name, I will give her eyes back.\n\nARYA: A girl has no name.\n\nJAQEN: Come.\n\nARYA walks to the well. JAQEN gives ARYA a bowl of water. ARYA hesitates to drink it.\n\nJAQEN: If a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear.\n\nARYA drinks the water. She closes her eyes. She slowly opens them to reveal the blindness has left them. She looks to JAQEN.\n\nJAQEN: Who are you?\n\nARYA: No one.\n\nEXT. NORTHERN WILDERNESS\n\nA horse and carriage are toting a few members of House Umber towards Winterfell.\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL - DINING HALL\n\nRAMSAY and LORD KARSTARK are seated at the dining table. A lady serves them drinks. SMALLJON is standing in front of them.\n\nRAMSAY: The Umbers are a famously loyal house.\n\nLORD KARSTARK: Famously loyal to the Starks.\n\nSMALLJON: And you, Lord Karstark? Your people share blood with the Starks, don t they?  But here we are. Times change.\n\nRAMSAY: When my father became Warden of the North, your house refused to pledge their banners.\n\nSMALLJON: Your father was a cunt.\n\nRAMSAY: My beloved father, the Warden --\n\nSMALLJON: Your father was a cunt and that s why you killed him.  I might ve done the same to my father, if he hadn t have done me the favor of dying on his own.\n\nRAMSAY: My father was poisoned by our enemies.\n\nSMALLJON: Mmm.\n\nRAMSAY: Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?\n\nSMALLJON: The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.  We re farther north than any of you fuckers. Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first.  I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all my life.  But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone.\n\nRAMSAY: So now you ve come seeking help?\n\nSMALLJON: We need to help each other.  The colder it gets, the farther South those goat fuckers will roam. Won't take them long to get here.\n\nLORD KARSTARK: You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?\n\nSMALLJON: If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe.  He knows this place better than we ever will.\n\nRAMSAY: Pledge your banners to House Bolton.  Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends.\n\nSMALLJON: I m not kissing your fucking hand.\n\nRAMSAY: Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.\n\nSMALLJON: I m not doing that either.\n\nRAMSAY: Why would I trust a man who won t honor tradition?\n\nSMALLJON: Your father honored tradition. Knelt for Robb Stark. Called him King of the North. Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?\n\nRAMSAY: Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.\n\nSMALLJON: Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths. I've got a gift for you.\n\nRAMSAY: A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.\n\nTwo hooded people are dragged into the hall.\n\nSMALLJON: A girl, aye.  A wild one.\n\nSMALLJON pulls the hood off one of the people, revealing OSHA. RAMSAY stands up.\n\nRAMSAY: I like them wild.\n\nSMALLJON: And the boy, nice and young. The way Karstark likes them.\n\nLORD KARSTARK stands up. SMALLJON pulls the hood off the other person, revealing RICKON STARK.\n\nRAMSAY: Who s this?\n\nSMALLJON: Rickon Stark.\n\nRAMSAY: How do I know that s Rickon Stark?\n\nSMALLJOY retrieves the severed head of Rickon's direwolf SHAGGYDOG and places it on the table. RAMSAY examines the head, looks at SMALLJON, and then smiles at RICKON.\n\nRAMSAY: Welcome home, Lord Stark.\n\nINT. CASTLE BLACK   JON SNOW S CHAMBER\n\nJON SNOW is sitting by the fireplace. He is looking to the ground. Someone knocks on the door. DOLOROUS EDD walks in.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: It s time.\n\nJON SNOW gets up, drops his vest with the stab holes in it on the table, and grabs his sword Longclaw.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK   COURTYARD\n\nMELISANDRE is standing on a balcony overlooking the courtyard. TORMUND, DAVOS, the wildlings, and the Night's Watch are all in attendance. JON SNOW walks past them, going up the stairs towards the gallows. DOLOROUS EDD accompanies him. BOWEN MARSH, OTHELL YARWICK, ALLISER THORNE, and OLLY are standing on a platform with their hands tied and ropes around their necks. JON SNOW looks up at them.\n\nJON SNOW: If you have any last words, now is the time.\n\nBOWEN MARSH: You shouldn t be alive. It s not right.\n\nJON SNOW: Neither was killing me.\n\nOTHELL YARWICK: My mother's still living at White Harbor. Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildings.\n\nALLISER THRONE: I had a choice, Lord Commander. Betray you or betray the Night s Watch. You brought an army of wildlings into our lands. An army of muderers and raiders. If I had to do it all over knowing where I d end up, I pray I d make the right choice again.\n\nJON SNOW: I m sure you would, Ser Alliser.\n\nALLISER THRONE: I fought, I lost. Now I rest. But you, Lord Snow, you ll be fighting their battles forever.\n\nJON SNOW looks at OLLY. OLLY stares back at him, unwavering. JON SNOW turns his back and unsheathes Longclaw. He breathes heavily. JON SNOW cuts the rope. The platform is pulled out from under the traitors  feet. They are hung. They choke and die. JON SNOW looks at OLLY again. OLLY's face is blue and swollen. JON SNOW sheathes his sword, then walks up to DOLOROUS EDD.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: We should burn the bodies.\n\nJON SNOW: You should.\n\nJON SNOW takes off his cape and hands it to DOLOROUS EDD.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: What do you want me to do with this?\n\nJON SNOW: Wear it. Burn it. Whatever you want. You have Castle Black.\n\nJON SNOW walks down the stairs.\n\nJON SNOW: My watch is ended.\n\nEveryone in attendance watches JON SNOW walk away.\n\nCREDITS\n\n", "episode_33": "\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 4 Episode 3 Script\n\nOpening Titles.\n\nOpen with a brief recap. Shot of Joffrey laying dead in his mothers lap. Blood pouring from his nose and saliva around his mouth. Cersei turns to Tyrion.\n\nEXT. KING'S LANDING - JOFFREY'S WEDDING - DAY\n\nCERSEI: You did this. You did this!\n\nThree guards grab Tyrion from behind.\nAs Sansa looks on, Ser Dontos Hollard approaches her.\n\nSER DONTOS: We have to leave.\n\nCERSEI: Take him! Take him!\n\nTyrion is dragged off by guards as Sansa and Ser Dontos rush off through the crowd.\n\nCERSEI: Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?\n\nTYWIN: Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.\n\nCERSEI: Where is she?!\n\nTYWIN: No one leaves the capital! No one!\n\nEXT. KINGS LANDING - SMALL DOCK - DUSK\n\nA bell tolls as Sansa and Ser Dontos rush down to a small boat, separate from the Harbor.\n\nSER DONTOS: Get in.\n\nSANSA: Where are we going?\n\nSER DONTOS: Somewhere safe.\n\nSansa and Ser Dontos sail out into the ocean, far from King's  Landing.\n\nEXT. MISTY OCEAN - NIGHT\n\nThey come across a huge myserious ship in the middle of the misty sea. Ser Dontos pulls his smaller boat up alongside it.\n\nSER DONTOS: Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know.\n\nEXT. LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP - MOMENTS LATER\n\nShe climbs up a ladder on the side of the ship, as she reaches the top someone grabs her. She gasps before realising who it is.\n\nSANSA: Lord Baelish?\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past.\n\nSer Dontos shouts up from his boat.\n\nSER DONTOS: Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water.\n\nSER DONTOS: I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.\n\nLITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?\n\nSER DONTOS: 10,000.\n\nLittlefinger clicks his finger and two men with crossbows walk to the edge of the ship. They aim at Ser Dontos.\n\nSER DONTOS: Wait!\n\nBoth men shoot at Ser Dontos, he groans in pain before lying dead. Sansa screams.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?\n\nSANSA: I didn't murder anyone.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.\n\nSansa glances back to Ser Dontos' body.\n\nSANSA: Why did you kill him?\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.\n\nSANSA: He saved me.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever.\n\nSANSA: He was helping me because I saved his life.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard.\n\nLittlefinger removes the necklace from around Sansa's neck and places it on the edge of the ship. He pull out a knife and hits one of the \"crystals\" and it smashes like glass. Sansa, confused, studies him.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?\n\nSANSA: We're all liars here.\n\nLittlefinger pushes the necklace off the edge of the boat and it lands directly on Ser Dontos' lifeless body.\n\nLITTLEFINGER: Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home.\n\nCUT TO:\nEXT. KING'S LANDING BALCONY - DAY\n\nMargaery Tyrell sits at the table with Olenna Tyrell.\n\nMARGAERY: So am I the queen?\n\nOLENNA: More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.\n\nMARGAERY: Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible.\n\nOLENNA: The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it.\n\nMARGAERY: What was it like?\n\nOLENNA: They took me to the Great Hall and there he was.\nThe man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.\n\nMARGAERY: One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.\n\nOLENNA: Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that.\n\nMARGAERY: But I would have been the queen.\n\nOLENNA: Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.\n\nCUT TO:\nINT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY\n\nJoffrey's body is laid on a table in the center on the room. Cersei, Tommen and Tywin and stood around him. Tywin turns to Tommen.\n\nTYWIN: Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?\n\nTommen stays quiet.\n\nTYWIN (CONT'D) I'm not trying to trick you.\n\nTOMMEN: It means I'll become king.\n\nTYWIN: Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?\n\nTOMMEN: A good king?\n\nTYWIN: Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm?\nWhat is a good king's single most important quality?\n\nCERSEI: This is hardly the place or the time.\n\nTOMMEN: Holiness?\n\nTYWIN: Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.\n\nTOMMEN: Justice.\n\nTYWIN: Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep\nafter less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?\n\nTOMMEN: No.\n\nTYWIN: No.\n\nTOMMEN: What about strength?\n\nTYWIN: Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him.\nSo, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?\n\nTOMMEN: Wisdom.\n\nTYWIN: Yes!\n\nTOMMEN: Wisdom is what makes a good king.\n\nTYWIN: Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?\n\nTOMMEN: No.\n\nTYWIN: No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age.\nAnd the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive.\nNow, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?\n\nTywin and Tommen begin walking up the steps to leave the Sept.\n\nTOMMEN: A king needs a queen.\n\nTYWIN: Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?\n\nTOMMEN: Yes.\n\nTYWIN: Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?\n\nTOMMEN: I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.\n- How are you? - I'm all right.\nYou are. You will be.\nI'll see to that.\nPlease give the queen a moment alone with her son.\n- Yes, my lord. - All of you.\n(SNAPS FINGERS)\n(DOORS ECHO SHUT)\nIt was Tyrion.\nHe killed him.\nHe told me he would.\n\"A day will come when you think you are safe and happy\nand your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.\"\nThat's what he said to me.\nYou saw it.\nYou saw Joff point at him just before he...\nI don't know what I saw.\nAvenge him.\nAvenge our son.\nKill Tyrion.\nTyrion's my brother.\nOur brother.\nThere'll be a trial.

CASTLE BLACK - NIGHTPan down from the inside of The Wall towards Castle Black. GHOST is howling. Slow zoom to JON SNOW s body, lying in the snow. A sign with the word  TRAITOR  is posted on a beam behind him. Closeup on JON SNOW. He is staring upwards, lifelessly. GHOST howls louder and pushes against the door to his pen.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - DAVOS  CHAMBER\n\nDAVOS hears GHOST s howling and exits, then peers across the courtyard and sees JON SNOW s body. He immediately runs down the steps. He slows as he approaches JON SNOW s body. Other brothers of the Night s Watch approach. DAVOS kneels beside JON SNOW s body.\n\nNIGHT S WATCHMAN: It s the Lord Commander!\n\nDOLOROUS EDD and other Night s Watchmen rush up behind DAVOS.\n\nDAVOS: Help me get him inside.\n\nThe other Night s Watch brothers pick up JON SNOW s body and carry it away. DAVOS remains, staring at the left over pool of blood.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - ROOM\n\nDOLOROUS EDD wipes the table clean. The other Night s Watch brothers place JON SNOW s body on the table. DOLOROUS EDD places his hand on JON SNOW s wounds, then brushes JON SNOW s eyes closed.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: Thorne did this.\n\nDAVOS: How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: Trust? The men in this room.\n\nDAVOS: Does the wolf know you?\n\nDOLOROUS EDD looks at DAVOS over his shoulder and nods.\n\nDAVOS: We need all the help we can get.\n\nAs DOLOROUS EDD moves towards the door, someone knocks on it. The Night s Watch brothers draw their blades.\n\nMELISANDRE (O.S.): Ser Davos.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD looks over his shoulder at DAVOS. DAVOS nods. The Night s Watch brothers sheathe their swords. DOLOROUS EDD walks to the door and opens it. MELISANDRE enters. DOLOROUS EDD closes the door behind her. MELISANDRE is distressed at the sight of JON SNOW s body.\n\nMELISANDRE: I saw him in the flames, fighting at Winterfell.\n\nDAVOS: I can t speak for the flames, but he s gone.\n\nMELISANDRE touches JON SNOW s cheek.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - MESS HALL\n\nALLISER THORNE sits at the high table among the other leaders of the Night s Watch. The rest of the Night s Watch brothers are shouting at each other.\n\nMALE VOICE #1: He was our Lord Commander!\n\nMALE VOICE #2: He never should have been!\n\nALLISER THORNE pounds his fist three times on the high table, then stands. The room quiets.\n\nALLISER THORNE: You all know why you re here. Jon Snow is dead.\n\nNIGHT S WATCHMAN #1: Who killed him?\n\nALLISER THORNE: I did.\n\nThe Night s Watch brothers resume shouting.\n\nALLISER THORNE: And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck and the other officers in this castle.\n\nNIGHT S WATCHMEN #1: Murderers!\n\nNIGHT S WATCHMAN #2: Traitors!\n\nThe shouting resumes. OLLIE walks up beside the high table. ALLISER THORNE pounds the high table again.\n\nALLISER THORNE: You re right!\n\nThe shouting stops.\n\nALLISER THORNE: We ve committed treason, all of us. Jon Snow was my Lord Commander. I had no love for him. That was no secret. But I never once disobeyed an order. Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night s Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me. I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night s Watch. Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night s Watch. He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before. He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered. Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I ve no doubt about that. And what he thought was right would have been the end of us. He thrust a terrible choice upon us, and we made it.\n\nThe men begin to murmur among themselves.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - ROOM\n\nGHOST nudges JON SNOW s hand and whimpers.\n\nDAVOS: He ll have seen we didn t come. Thorne will have made it official by now. Castle Black is his.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: I don t care who s sitting at the high table. Jon was my friend, and those fuckers butchered him. Now we return the favor.\n\nDAVOS: We don t have the numbers.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: We have a direwolf.\n\nDAVOS: It s not enough. I didn t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn t have wanted his friends to die for nothing.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room. We all die today. I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.\n\nDAVOS: We need to fight, but we don t need to die. Not if we have help.\n\nNIGHT S WATCHMAN: Who s gonna help us?\n\nDAVOS: You re not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD s washes over with realization. He turns to the Night s Watchman at his side.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: Bolt the door. Don t let anyone in. I ll be back as soon as I can.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD leaves through the door.\nEXT. WINTERFELL - DAYTwo men sit on horses on a hill outside Winterfell. They carry flags bearing the flayed man sigil of House Bolton.\n\nRAMSAY (V.O.): She was 11 the first time I saw her.\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL - ROOM\n\nMYRANDA s body lies on a table.\n\nRAMSAY: The kennelmaster s daughter. She smelled of dog. I wasn t much older, but everybody was already afraid of me. You certainly were.\n\nRAMSAY turns and looks at MAESTER WOLKAN, then looks back at MYRANDA s body..\n\nRAMSAY: Myranda wasn t, though. What could I do to her that those hounds couldn t? She was fearless. There was nothing she wouldn t do.\n\nRAMSAY stands and places his hand on MYRANDA s forehead.\n\nRAMSAY: Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over. I wish you could be here to watch.\n\nRAMSAY looks as though he is going to cry.\n\nMAESTER WOLKAN: Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord? Or would you rather the men build a pyre?\n\nRAMSAY: Buried, burned?\n\nRAMSAY walks past MAESTER WOLKAN as he exits the room.\n\nRAMSAY: This is good meat. Feed it to the hounds.\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL - HALLWAY\n\nRAMSAY is walking with ROOSE.\n\nROOSE: Your command of the cavalry was impressive. Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead. Do you know who struck the killing blow?\n\nRAMSAY: No.\n\nROOSE: A shame. I d reward the man.  Still, a great victory. Do you feel like a victor?\n\nRAMSAY and ROOSE stop walking. RAMSAY looks back over his shoulder at ROOSE.\n\nROOSE: I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark. Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?\n\nRAMSAY: No.\n\nROOSE walks past RAMSAY into Winterfell s great hall.\n\nROOSE: A reckoning will come. We need the North to face it. The entire North. They won t back us without Sansa Stark. We no longer have Sansa Stark. You played your games with her. You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they re both gone.\n\nRAMSAY: I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds. They won t get far.\n\nROOSE: I m glad to hear it. Without Sansa, you won t be able to produce an heir. And without an heir, well \n\nROOSE sits at the dinner table. RAMSAY stares at him, astonished.\n\nROOSE: ...let s hope the maesters are right and Lady Walder s carrying a boy.\nEXT. NORTHERN WILDERNESSSANSA and THEON are running through the woods frantically. The barking of dogs can be heard in the distance. SANSA tires. THEON runs back to hear and pulls her onward.\n\nTHEON: We can t stop.\n\nThe pair resume running. They happen upon a large, snowy river.\n\nTHEON: We have to cross here.\n\nSANSA steps on a patch of thin ice and gasps.\n\nSANSA: I can t.\n\nTHEON: It s the only way to throw off the hounds.\n\nSANSA: But it s too cold. I can t. I won t make it. I ll die.\n\nTHEON: I ve seen what his hounds do to a person. This way is better.\n\nTHEON guides SANSA into the water. SANSA gasps at the cold. The both wade across.\n\nCUT TO: NORTHERN WILDERNESS - WOODS\n\nTHEON and SANSA are walking together. They are blue with cold. Barking can no longer be heard. THEON spots something off camera.\n\nTHEON: Over here. Come on.\n\nTHEON leads SANSA to an overturned tree. Its roots provide shelter from the snow. They sit down under the roots, shivering.\n\nTHEON: Sansa. Sansa.\n\nTHEON wraps his arms around SANSA. She rests her head on his shoulder and closes her eyes. Dogs barking can suddenly be heard closeby.\n\nTHEON: Stay here. I ll lure them away.\n\nSANSA: No, I won t make it without you.\n\nTHEON: You will. Go north, only north. Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black. He ll help you.\n\nTHEON runs into the woods but is immediately confronted by House Bolton soldiers and hounds.\n\nBOLTON OFFICER: Where is Lady Bolton?\n\nTHEON: Dead.\n\nBOLTON OFFICER: Liar.\n\nTHEON: She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts. I left her to die in the snow.\n\nThe dogs catch SANSA s scent and begin barking. They lead the soldiers to SANSA under the roots of the tree. SANSA cowers from them.\n\nBOLTON OFFICER: I can t wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.\n\nOne of the soldiers grabs SANSA and pulls her to her feet. A horse whinnies in the distance. The soldiers draw their weapons. BRIENNE and PODRICK ride towards the soldiers with their sword drawn.\n\nBOLTON OFFICER: It s a bloody woman.\n\nBRIENNE cuts down BOLTON OFFICER as she rides past. PODRICK engages one of the soldiers in mounted combat. BRIENNE faces off with another mounted soldier. Their blades clash, but neither is hit. As BRIENNE rides past him, another soldier knocks her from her horse. She drops her blade but scrambles to retrieve it when she sees a soldier advancing towards her on foot. When she reaches the blade, the soldier kicks her. She retrieves the blade again and stands, engaging him in a swordfight. She cuts him down. A mounted soldier charges at BRIENNE. She jumps and strikes him, causing his horse to fall over, trapping him beneath it. While PODRICK continues his mounted sword fight, THEON grabs the blade of a fallen soldier off the ground. PODRICK cuts down the soldier he is fighting and they both fall from their horses. Another soldier advances on PODRICK, and they begin fighting. BRIENNE crawls over to the man trapped beneath his horse and slits his throat with a dagger. The soldier PODRICK is fighting knocks PODRICK s sword out of his hand. PODRICK falls to the ground. Just before the soldier is about to strike PODRICK, THEON stabs the soldier from behind. PODRICK stands up. BRIENNE walks over to SANSA. SANSA stands up to confront her.

JAIME turns and looks back into CERSEI s room, then enters it.\n\nCERSEI: Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?\n\nJAIME: Mother.\n\nCERSEI: All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now. Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?\n\nCERSEI begins to tear up.\n\nCERSEI:  I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.\n\nJAIME walks over to CERSEI and kneels in front of her.\n\nCERSEI: I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.\n\nJAIME: Shh, shh. Don t think about it.\n\nCERSEI: I have to. I have to. It s not right she has to suffer alone.\n\nJAIME: She s not suffering. She s gone. No one can hurt her anymore.\n\nCERSEI (crying): She was good. From her first breath, she was so sweet. I don t know where she came from. She was nothing like me. No meanness, no jealous, just good.\n\nJAIME: I know.\n\nCERSEI: I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I m not a monster.\n\nJAIME: Listen -- listen to me. She was my daughter and I failed her.\n\nCERSEI: No, I knew this would happen. The witch told me years ago. She promised me three children. She promised me they d die.  And gold their shrouds.  Everything she said came true. You couldn t have stopped it. It s prophecy. It s fate.\n\nJAIME: You don t believe that.\n\nCERSEI: Of course I do. You told me yourself when Father died. You said we had to stay together. You said people would try to tear us apart, take what s ours. That was a prophecy, too. I didn t listen to you, and everything you said came true.\n\nJAIME places his hand on CERSEI s cheek..\n\nJAIME: Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate. Fuck everyone who isn t us. We re the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world. And everything they ve taken from us, we re going to take back and more.\n\nJAIME embraces CERSEI.\n\nJAIME: We re going to take everything there is.\nINT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - MARGAERY s CELLSEPTA UNELLA is reading scripture  to MARGAERY.\n\nSEPTA UNELLA:  The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men.

I ll speak with her.\n\nMARGAERY: My brother, can you tell me how he is?\n\nHIGH SPARROW sits on a stool beside MARGAERY.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: It isn t Ser Loras that brings me here. Your husband misses you dearly. The love between a man and wife is sacred. It reflects the love the gods have for all of us. But sin leads us away from the sacred. And only confession can purge sin.\n\nMARGAERY: I have nothing to confess.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: So you believe you are pure? Perfect? Wholly without sin?\n\nMARGAERY: None of us are.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: You have started down the path. But you have many miles to go..\n\nHIGH SPARROW exits. MARGAERY hugs her knees.\nEXT.

Sailed around the world. Fought men from every country. Lay with the most beautiful women alive.\n\nELLARIA: And men.\n\nDORAN: And men. He experienced everything, while I sat here in Dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed. But that is life. We each have our roles.\n\nDORAN sits in his wheelchair. ELLARIA places a pillow behind him.\n\nDORAN: Oberyn was born to be an adventurer. And I was born to rule.\n\nELLARIA: The gods are not fools. You would have been a lousy adventurer. And Oberyn, pfft, he would have been a terrible ruler.\n\nA maester approaches.\n\nDORAN (to TYENE): Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?\n\nMAESTER: Prince Doran.\n\nThe maester bows and hands DORAN a scroll. DORAN unravels and reads it.\n\nDORAN: The Princess Myrcella \n\nTYENE produces  a dagger from her boot and stabs AREO in the back, killing him. ELLARIA produces a dagger of her own and stabs DORAN in the chest. The maester tries to run away, but TYENE retrieves her dagger from AREO s body and throws it into the back of the maester s neck, killing him. ELLARIA removes her dagger from DORAN s chest and pushes him to the ground. The remaining guards do nothing.\n\nELLARIA: When was the last time you left this palace? You don t know your own people. Their disgust for you. Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing. Oberyn martell butchered, and you did nothing. You re not a Dornishman. You re not our prince.\n\nDORAN is bleeding out on the ground. He gasps for air.\n\nDORAN: My son Trystane \n\nELLARIA scoffs.\n\nELLARIA: Your son is weak just like you.

I don t want to hurt you.\n\nNYMERIA: Her or me?\n\nTRYSTANE draws his blade and points it at NYMERIA.\n\nNYMERIA: Good.\n\nOBARA: Smart boy.\n\nTRYSTANE steps between the two women, readying himself to fight NYMERIA.

MEEREEN TOWNSHIP - DAYTYRION and VARYS are walking through the streets together.\n\nTYRION: We re never going to fix what s wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.\n\nVARYS looks over his shoulder at a passing commoner.\n\nTYRION: We ll be fine. We re dressed like common merchants.\n\nVARYS: You walk like a rich person.\n\nTYRION: You ve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?\n\nVARYS: You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property. I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.\n\nTYRION: It s a good thing you re not a boy anymore...because you have no cock.\n\nA woman is lying in the street holding a baby. TYRION and VARYS approach.\n\nTYRION (speaking Valyrian): For your baby. To eat.\n\nThe woman cowers away from TYRION.\n\nVARYS (to TYRION): She thinks you want to eat her baby.\n\nVARYS kneels.\n\nVARYS (speaking Valyrian): His Valyrian is terrible. He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat.\n\nVARYS hands the woman money. She gestures at them to thank them, and they walk on. They walk into a courtyard where  KILL THE MASTERS  is written in red on a wall. Beneath it,  MHYSA IS A MASTER,  is written.\n\nVARYS: Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.\n\nTYRION: I know what mhysa means.\n\nVARYS: Who wrote it?\n\nTYRION: Hard to know. Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.\n\nVARYS: The Sons of the Harpy?\n\nTYRION: Very possibly. Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren t even property to begin with. You can see why they re unhappy. Of course, it could also be the freed men.\n\nTYRION and VARYS enter a chamber where a red priest is preaching to a group of listeners.\n\nLISTENERS (speaking Valyrian): For the night is dark and full of terrors.\n\nRED PRIEST: The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you, and those who love the darkness chased her away.\n\nTYRION: Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.\n\nVARYS: She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.\n\nRED PRIEST: How will you respond? Will you wring your hands, while you wait for the Mother of Dragons to return? Or will you  you take up her flames yourselves? Will you fight for your own salvation, now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you?\n\nTYRION: It s a problem.\n\nTYRION and VARYS proceed in a much larger courtyard.\n\nTYRION: Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill. Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you. We can t fight an enemy we don t know.\n\nVARYS: The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone.\n\nTYRION: And have you started looking for that someone?\n\nVARYS: My little birds have already taken wing. Soon they ll return, singing songs of men in gold masks.\n\nMen are shouting in the distance. A bell begins to toll. A flood of people run through an archway on the opposite side of the courtyard toward TYRION and VARYS, then run past them. TYRION and VARYS proceed through the archway and into the harbor. Smoke pours from the burning wreckage of all the ships in the harbor.\n\nTYRION: Well, we won t be sailing to Westeros anytime soon.\nEXT.

They proceed across the countryside.\n\nDAARIO: Perhaps she s tired of being queen. I don t think she likes it very much.\n\nJORAH: She s too smart to like it.\n\nDAARIO: Maybe she s flown somewhere else, somewhere far away from men like us.\n\nJORAH: I ve been all over the world. There s no escaping men like us.\n\nDAARIO: There s no escaping her, eh? You keep coming back. Why?\n\nJORAH: You know why.\n\nDAARIO: isn t it frustrating wanting someone who doesn t want you back?\n\nJORAH: Of course it is.\n\nDAARIO: You re a romantic. I admire that. Sometimes I look at you and I think,  So that s what I ll be like when I grow old. \n\nJORAH: If you grow old.\n\nDAARIO: If I grow old. I hope I do. I want to see what the world looks like when she s done conquering it.\n\nJORAH: So do I.\n\nJORAH stops his horse. DAARIO proceeds ahead. JORAH pulls back his sleeve and looks at the growing patch of Greyscale on his forearm. The men resume riding in unison. They pull up on a circular swathe of horse tracks. There is a smaller circle of untouched grass in the center of the swathe.\n\nDAARIO: Huh, an army?\n\nJORAH: Not an army. A horde.\n\nJORAH dismounts his horse and walks to the circle of untouched grass.\n\nDAARIO: Dothraki?\n\nJORAH looks down and sees something in the grass. He bends down and retrieves a ring.\n\nJORAH: They have her.\nEXT. ESSOS ARID LANDS - DAYThe Dothraki horde is traveling together in great numbers. DAENERYS is walking beside the horse of two Dothraki bloodriders. DAENERYS trips. BLOODRIDER #1 whips her. Both men laugh. They speak in Dothraki.\n\nBLOODRIDER #1: Maybe she saw a ghost. My friend s mother saw a ghost and her hair turned white.\n\nBLOODRIDER #2: Pink people are afraid of the sun. It burns their skin. This one stands too long in the sun and her hair goes white.\n\nBLOODRIDER #1: You think she s got white pussy hair too? You ever been with a girl with white pussy hair?\n\nBLOODRIDER #2: Only when I was fucking your grandma.\n\nBLOODRIDER #1 chuckles and makes a kissing sound at DAENERYS.\n\nBLOODRIDER #1 (to DAENERYS): I ll ask Khal Moro for a night with you. What do you think?\n\nBLOODRIDER #2: Pretty eyes, but she s an idiot.\n\nBLOODRIDER #1: She doesn t have to be smart to get fucked in the ass.\n\nBLOODRIDER #2: I like to talk when I m finished. Otherwise, we might as well be dogs.\n\nCUT TO: ESSOS ARID LANDS - DOTHRAKI SETTLEMENT\n\nThe Dothraki folk are tending to their affairs.

The white-haired girl we found in the hills.\n\nBLOODRIDER #1 pushes DAENERYS towards KHAL MORO. KHAL MORO considers her. The attendants speak in Dothraki.\n\nBLOODRIDER #3: Look at those lips, blood of my blood.\n\nWIFE #1: Blue-eyed women are witches.\n\nWIFE #2: It is known.\n\nWIFE#1: Cut off her head, before she casts a spell on you.\n\nKHAL MORO stands and walks around DAENERYS.\n\nKHAL MORO: Even if I was blind, I d hear my wives say,  Cut off her head  and I d know this woman was beautiful. I m glad I m not blind. Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time, what is better than that?\n\nBLOODRIDER #3: Killing another Khal?\n\nKHAL MORO: Yes, killing another Khal.\n\nBLOODRIDER #4: Conquering a city and taking her people as slaves, and taking her idols back to Vaes Dothrak.\n\nBLOODRIDER #3: Breaking a wild horse, forcing it to submit to your will.\n\nKHAL MORO (annoyed): Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time is among the five best things in life.\n\nKHAL MORO grabs DAENERYS by the chest.\n\nDAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): Do not touch me.\n\nThe bloodriders and wives look at each other. KHAL MORO released DAENERYS.\n\nDAENERYS: I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar of the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.\n\nKHAL MORO and his bloodriders laugh. He places his hand on the back of DAENERYS  head\n\nKHAL MORO: You are nobody, the millionth of your name, Queen of Nothing, slave of Khal Moro. Tonight I will lie with you, and if the Great Stallion is kind, you will give me a son. Do you understand?\n\nDAENERYS: I will not lie with you. And I will bear no children, for you, or anyone else. Not until the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east.\n\nWIFE #1: I told you she was a witch. Cut off her head.\n\nKHAL MORO: I like her. She has spirit.\n\nDAENERYS: I was wife of Khal Drogo, son of Khal Bharbo.\n\nKHAL MORO takes his hand away from DAENERYS and steps backwards.\n\nKHAL MORO: Khal Drogo is dead.\n\nDAENERYS: I know. I burnt his body.\n\nKHAL MORO: Forgive me. I did not know. It is forbidden to lie with a Khal s widow. No one will touch you. You have my word.\n\nKHAL MORO draws his blade and cuts DAENERYS  bindings.\n\nDAENERYS: If you will escort me back to Meereen, I will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses, as a sign of my gratitude.\n\nKHAL MORO: When a Khal dies, there is only one place for his Khaleesi.\n\nKHAL MORO sits down.\n\nWIFE #1: Vaes Dothrak.

OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL\n\nStannis sees he the army approaching. He takes a deep breath then unsheathes his sword. Cut to an overhead shot revealing Stannis is badly outnumbered.\n\nEXT. WINTERFELL - BROKEN TOWER\n\nSansa watches from the window as the fight begins. She walks away from the window.\n\nEXT. WINTERFELL - WOODS\n\nPan across the ground to reveal all but one of Stannis s men are slaughtered alongside various banners and shields with his sigil. Stannis hobbles away from these men, using his sword as a crutch. Two Bolton men arrive on horse and kill the lone survivor of Stannis s men. They charge at Stannis, one slices his leg, but he kills them both with a dagger and sword then falls to the ground.\n\nStannis leans onto a tree and groans. He looks down to his bleeding leg with a resigned look, then looks up to the sound of a horse riding.\n\nSTANNIS: Bolton has women fighting for him.\n\nCut up to Brienne of Tarth.\n\nBRIENNE: I do not fight for the Boltons. I m Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?\n\nStannis is silent for a long moment.\n\nSTANNIS: I did.\n\nBrienne approaches him and unsheathes her sword.\n\nBRIENNE: In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?\n\nSTANNIS: Go on, do your duty.\n\nBrienne unsheathes her sword, pulls it back, swings forward, and--\n\nCUT TO: EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD\n\nRamsay plunges his sword into a survivor. Then he surveys the corpses on the battlefield.\n\nRAMSAY: Looks like we re done here.\n\nRamsay heads back towards his horse but sees one of Stannis s men is survive, and is attempting to crawl away.\n\nSURVIVOR: I surrender. I surrender!\n\nRAMSAY: And I accept your surrender.\n\nRamsay plunges his sword into the man then pulls it out and wipes the blood off.\n\nRAMSAY (to squire): Let s head back. My wife must be lonely.\n\nPan out to reveal the bodies on the battlefield.\n\nEXT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD\n\nSansa hurries through Winterfell with her hood on. She heads up the stairs, sees one of the Bolton men walking her way, and doubles back.\n\nEXT. WINTERFELL - BALCONY\n\nSansa rushes through a door towards the exit. She finds Myranda and Theon waiting for her, with Myranda s bow drawn.\n\nMYRANDA: My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.\n\nTHEON: Go with her. Please.\n\nSANSA: I know what Ramsay is. I know what he ll do to me. (looks to Theon) If I m going to die, let it happen while there s some of me left.\n\nMYRANDA: Die? (lowers the bow) Who said anything about dying? You can t die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn t need all of you. Just the parts he ll use to make his heir. Until you ve given him a boy or two and he s finished using them. (raises bow) He s got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?\n\nSansa says nothing.\n\nMYRANDA: You re leaving it to me? Good. Let s begin.\n\nShe draws her arrow back. Just as she goes to release it, Theon tackles her into a wall, causing the arrow to miss Sansa. They struggle for a moment.\n\nMYRANDA: Stop! Stop!\n\nTheon throws her over the edge, killing her on impact. As Sansa and Theon go to the edge to inspect the body, a horn begins to blare.\n\nMAN: Open the gates!\n\nBolton men return from the battle and ride through the gates to Winterfell.\n\nTHEON: He s coming back.\n\nTheon grabs Sansa s hand and leads her along the walls. They climb to the top of the wall and look down to see a pile of snow at the bottom. Theon offers his hand to Sansa, she takes it, and they leap off of the wall.\n\nINT. BRAAVOS - BROTHEL\n\nMeryn Trant looks to 3 young girls in front of him and tightens his grip on the stick in his hand. He walks behind the first one and whips her, she starts crying. He does the same to the second and she cries as well. He walks up to the third girl, whose face is hidden by her hair, and whips her in the back. She doesn t react. He whips her harder in the side and doesn t get a reaction. He whips her a third time across the face and the girl still doesn t make a sound.\n\nMERYN: I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.\n\nThe two other girls flee the room. The third removes her hair to show an unknown face. Meryn punches her in the stomach. She falls to the ground doubled over. Meryn smiles but loses the smile when he sees she is reaching for something. The girl pulls off her face, revealing she is Arya, and leaps towards Trant, stabbing him in the eye. She stabs his other eye then gags him with his shirt as he screams. He grabs at her but she stabs him in the chest until he rolls on his side.\n\nARYA: You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I ve gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I m glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?\n\nTrant struggles to make a noise through the gag.\n\nARYA: I can t hear you.\n\nShe stabs him in the stomach.\n\nARYA: You know who I am. I m Arya Stark.\n\nA look of surprise comes across Trant s face, he grunts, and then Arya stabs him in the back. She removes the gag.\n\nARYA: Do you know who you are?\n\nTrant whimpers.\n\nARYA: You re no one. You re nothing.\n\nShe slowly slits his throat and he keels over.\n\nINT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - FACE ROOM\n\nArya walks into the room holding the face of the girl she wore to the brothel. She returns it to where she took it from.\n\nJAQEN: A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.\n\nWAIF: I was right about her.\n\nJAQEN: You were.\n\nWAIF: You re not ready. Not at all.\n\nThe waif grabs Arya and holds her in front of Jaqen.\n\nJAQEN: That man s life wasn t yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.\n\nJaqen holds up the same vial he gave to Arya to give to the Thin Man. The waif holds Arya s face up near the vial as she struggles.\n\nJAQEN: Only death can pay for life.\n\nJaqen drinks the vial and then falls straight to the ground.\n\nARYA: No! No! No, you don t die! Don t die! (sobs)\n\nWAIF: Why are you crying?\n\nARYA: He was my friend.\n\nWAIF: No he wasn t. Didn t you listen to him?\n\nJAQEN (O.S.): He was no one.\n\nArya turns to see a man looking identical to Jaqen standing behind her.\n\nARYA: But if you re  (looks to the Jaqen who drank the potion and is seemingly dead) Who s this?\n\nJAQEN: No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.\n\nArya reaches and pulls off the Jaqen face, revealing the face of an old man.\n\nJAQEN: The faces are for no one.\n\nArya pulls off the old man face to reveal a younger man s face.\n\nJAQEN: You are still someone.\n\nArya pulls off the young man s face to reveal a different old man.\n\nJAQEN: And to someone \n\nArya pulls off multiple faces, revealing the face of multiple different men.\n\nJAQEN: ...the faces are as good as poison.\n\nArya pulls off the final face and sees her own face staring back at her.\n\nARYA: I can t see!\n\nArya s vision begins to blur until the screen goes black.\n\nARYA: What s happening?! What s happening?!\n\nEXT. DORNE - DOCK\n\nMyrcella kisses Prince Doran.\n\nDORAN (to Jaime): I wish you a safe journey home.\n\nJAIME: Thank you.\n\nDoran looks to Ellaria and nods. She walks up to Myrcella.\n\nELLARIA: Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.\n\nEllaria kisses Myrcella on the lips, holding the kiss then rubbing her lips. She nods to Jaime and Jaime nods back. Jaime helps Myrcella into the boat.\n\nBRONN: Maybe I ll come visit you sometime.\n\nTYENE: Maybe I ll come visit you.\n\nBRONN: Don t wait too long. I ve a noble woman to marry back home.\n\nTYENE (leans in): You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy.

SEA OF DORNE - BOAT\n\nMyrcella looks down at her lion necklace.\n\nJAIME: Try not to lose it this time.\n\nMYRCELLA: I ll never take it off again.\n\nJAIME: I know you didn t want to leave Dorne. But I m glad you re coming home. Your mother s desperate to see you. And I m glad Trystane s coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You re lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so  so well arranged.\n\nMYRCELLA: Do you think mother will like him.\n\nJAIME: If she sees you re happy, I m sure she will.\n\nMYRCELLA (laughing): And you really believe that?\n\nJAIME (smiles): Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?\n\nMYRCELLA: She likes you.\n\nJAIME: I m not so sure about that. Listen. There s something I ve wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you ve seen more of the world, you ve learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you ve fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? (Myrcella laughs) My point is  we don t choose whom we love. We just  It s beyond our control. I sound like an idiot.\n\nMYRCELLA: No you don t.\n\nJAIME: What I m trying to say. What I m trying and failing to say \n\nMYRCELLA: I know what you re trying to say.\n\nJAIME: No. I m afraid you don t.\n\nMyrcella stands up and looks Jaime in the eyes.\n\nMYRCELLA: I do.\n\nShe takes his good hand in hers.\n\nMYRCELLA: I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I m glad. I m glad that you re my father.\n\nJaime looks shocked but happy. They embrace. She releases the hug and smiles at Jaime, with blood beginning to trickle out her nose.\n\nJAIME: Myrcella?\n\nThe bleeding gets worse.\n\nJAIME: Myrcella?!\n\nMyrcella collapses in Jaime s arms, blood streaming down her face.\n\nJAIME: Myrcella?! Myrcella?!\n\nCUT TO: EXT. DORNE - DOCK\n\nEllaria stares at Jaime s ship from the dock. Blood begins to trickle out of her nose and splatter the floor. Tyene hands her a rag for the blood and she wipes it away then thrrows the rag away. She opens the antidote and drinks it down. She and the Sand Snakes begin walking from the dock.\n\nINT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID\n\nTyrion, Daario, and Jorah sit on the steps in Dany s throne room.\n\nTYRION (to Jorah): You love her, don t you? How could you not. Of course, it s hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman.\n\nDAARIO: Does he always talk so much?\n\nJorah nods. Missandei brings Grey Worm into the room, with bandages around his torso.\n\nGREY WORM: Jorah the Andal.\n\nJORAH: Torgo Nudho.\n\nGREY WORM: You should not be here.\n\nDAARIO: No, but he is.\n\nGREY WORM: Our queen ordered him exiled from city.\n\nDAARIO: Our queen would be dead if not for him.\n\nMISSANDEI (Valyrian): It s true. And I would be dead if not for the  (look at Tyrion) little man.\n\nTYRION (Valyrian): Dwarf. I believe that s the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit  nostril .\n\nMISSANDEI: (Valyrian) A bit  rusty .\n\nTYRION: (Valyrian)  Rusty  (Common Tongue) Thank you.\n\nGREY WORM: I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.\n\nDAARIO: You missed a good scrap.\n\nJORAH: None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.\n\nTYRION: He s right. The dragon headed north. If we re going to find her, that s where we re to go.\n\nJORAH: We? You re a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.\n\nTYRION: And I intend to help her do it.\n\nJORAH: You ve been here for how many days now? I ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.\n\nTYRION: You betrayed her!\n\nJORAH: Careful now.\n\nTYRION: And she exiled you, twice, I believe?\n\nJORAH: The second time thanks to you.\n\nTYRION: Don t blame me for your crimes, Mormont.\n\nDAARIO: (gestures to Tyrion) He s right. The Queen exiled Jorah. (gestures to Jorah) And he s right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we ll know is if we ask her.\n\nTYRION: Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.\n\nJORAH: If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.\n\nDAARIO (to Tyrion): Forgive me, but why would we bring you?\n\nTYRION: Pardon me?\n\nDAARIO: Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?\n\nTYRION: Not precisely, but I have other skills that d be very useful--\n\nDAARIO: Can you fight?\n\nTYRION: I have fought. I don t claim to be a great warrior.\n\nDAARIO: Are you good on a horse?\n\nTYRION: Middling.\n\nDAARIO: So mainly you talk?\n\nTYRION: And drink. I ve survived so far.\n\nDAARIO: Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. (to Missandei, Grey Worm, and Jorah) None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.\n\nJORAH: He s a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?\n\nDAARIO: They wouldn t. They will listen to Grey Worm.\n\nGREY WORM: I ll come with you. I ll find our queen.\n\nMISSANDEI: You are not strong enough to go anywhere.\n\nGREY WORM: I am.\n\nDAARIO: He is, he s the toughest man with no balls I ve ever met. But you still can t go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen.\n\nMISSANDEI: It s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half.\n\nDAARIO: And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen s closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. (to Tyrion) Try not to ruin her. (to Jorah) Looks like it s you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about.\n\nTyrion walks down the steps towards Missandei and Grey Worm. They exchange uncertain glances with each other.\n\nEXT. MEEREEN - BALCONY\n\nTyrion stands in the place where Dany had Mossador executed and watches Jorah and Daario ride out of the city.\n\nVOICE (O.S.): Hello, old friend.\n\nTyrion turns to see Varys on the balcony next to him.\n\nVARYS: I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.\n\nTYRION: I suppose there s no point in asking how you found me.\n\nVARYS: The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you ve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons.\n\nTYRION: Well, she didn t execute me, so that s a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?\n\nVARYS: Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies  strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.\n\nTYRION: If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.\n\nVARYS: If only. (beat) A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?\n\nTyrion looks up to Varys with a slight smile.\n\nTYRION: I did miss you.\n\nVARYS: Oh, I know.\n\nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - PLATEAU\n\nDany looks to Drogon who is lying down in a ring full of bones.\n\nDAENERYS: We have to go home.\n\nDrogon lies down and grunts.\n\nDAENERYS: My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? (pause) We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?\n\nDaenerys pets his nose but gets no response.\n\nDAENERYS: How far did you carry me? (surveys the area)\n\nDrogon begins turning away from her to lick at his wounds.\n\nDAENERYS: Drogon, we need to return. My people need me.\n\nShe climbs back on his back, but he hisses and bucks her off, then goes to sleep.\n\nDAENERYS: Well, there s no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper.\n\nDany begins walking across the plateau to explore. A horse gallops in the distance. Camera cuts to reveal the pony-tail of a Dothraki. Three more Dothraki men arrive on horseback. Daenerys drops her ring to the ground. Another group of Dothraki arrives, and then the rest of the khalasar. They begin circling around Daenerys, howling.\n\nINT. CERSEI S CELL\n\nCersei is huddled in the corner. She shudders as the door opens.\n\nSEPTA: Confess. Confess.\n\nCersei looks up to the Septa.\n\nINT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW S ROOM\n\nCersei is knelt before the High Sparrow in the room where she was taken away.\n\nCERSEI: I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--\n\nHIGH SPARROW: You wish to make a confession?\n\nCERSEI: Once I ve confessed, will I be free?\n\nSPARROW: Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.\n\nCERSEI: The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess.\n\nSPARROW: Name him.\n\nCERSEI: Lancel Lannister.\n\nSPARROW: Your cousin. And the King s squire.\n\nCERSEI: I was lonely and afraid.\n\nSPARROW: You had a husband.\n\nCERSEI: A husband of whoring every chance he got.\n\nSPARROW: His sins do not pardon your own.\n\nCERSEI: May the gods forgive me.\n\nSPARROW: Other men?\n\nCERSEI: No.\n\nSPARROW: No others?\n\nCERSEI: No.\n\nSPARROW: Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?\n\nCERSEI: I do.\n\nSPARROW: There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.\n\nCERSEI: A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother s children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers . The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it.\n\nSPARROW: Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence.\n\nCERSEI: Trial? I have confessed?\n\nSPARROW: To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.\n\nCERSEI: I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother s mercy. I haven t seen my son  I don t know how long it s been. I need to see him. Please.\n\nSPARROW: You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.\n\nCERSEI: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nSPARROW: The Mother is merciful. It is her you should thank.\n\nCERSEI: I will, I will. I swear it, day and night.\n\nSPARROW: Good.\n\nCERSEI: Am I free to go?\n\nSPARROW: After your atonement.\n\nCERSEI: My atonement?\n\nINT. CERSEI S CELL\n\nCersei is stripped naked and has the dirt washed off of her by the septas. After they scrub her clean, they sit her down and begin chopping her hair away with a knife. They leave her naked, with short hair and a bloody scalp, and then shut the door on her.\n\nEXT. KING S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nCersei is carried to the top of the steps, in front of a massive crowd of King s Landing citizens.\n\nSPARROW: A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement.\n\nThe septas remove her robe. She stands naked before the citizens of King s Landing, who gasp. They force her to start walking down the stairs.\n\nSEPTA: Shame. Shame. Shame. (rings bell)\n\nThe septa repeats  Shame. Shame. Shame.  and rings the bell through the duration of Cersei s walk. Cersei is escorted by the Sparrows through the crowd of people. Silence at first, but once one man yells  Cunt! , she begins to be heckled.\n\nCROWD: Bitch! Whore! All hail her royal tits!\n\nThey begin pelting her with food. A prostitute runs in front of Cersei with her breasts out.\n\nWOMAN: I ve had half as many cocks as the queen!\n\nThe sparrows force her out of Cersei s way. A man with his penis out runs in front of her later in the walk.\n\nMAN: Suck me off! Suck me off, you bitch!\n\nAs Cersei approaches the end of her walk things get more violent. A man spits directly in her face, and a Sparrow has to beat a woman with a club as she charges Cersei. She is knocked to her knees at the end of her walk, but gets back to her feet when she sees the Red Keep in the distance. She finally reaches the end of the walk of atonement, and enters the Red Keep, sobbing.\n\nINT. RED KEEP\n\nKevan Lannister, Grand Maester Pycelle, Qyburn, and the Lannister guards wait for her. Qyburn rushes to cover her naked body with a blanket as Cersei begins weeping.\n\nQYBURN: Your Grace. It s good to have you back. Come. We ll take you inside. I need to have a look at those feet.\n\nCut to her bloody feet. We hear two giant footsteps off screen.\n\nQYBURN: May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard.\n\nA hulking man, who is revealed to have a blue face through the eye holes in his helm, walks over to Qyburn and Cersei. He takes Cersei in his arms.\n\nQYBURN: If it please Your Grace, he s taken a holy vow of silence. He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Grace s enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm.\n\nEXT. CASTLE BLACK\n\nJon and Davos exit the elevator.\n\nDAVOS: He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!\n\nJON: We don t have enough men to make any difference.\n\nDAVOS: The wildlings will make a difference!\n\nJON: The wildlings won t ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--\n\nDAVOS: You saved their bloody lives. If they re going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.\n\nJON: It s not their fight!\n\nThe gates to Castle Black are opened and Melisandre arrives, alone and on horseback. Jon and Davos rush over to her.\n\nJON: Stannis?\n\nNo response.\n\nDAVOS: Shireen? The princess?\n\nA long look but no response. Melisandre walks away from the two of them.\n\nINT. CASTLE BLACK - JON S ROOM\n\nJon goes through the various scrolls on his desk. Olly enters the room.\n\nOLLY: Lord Commander. It s one of the wildlings you brought back.

Said he knows where to find him.\n\nJon rushes out of his room down to the ground. He is met by Alliser.\n\nALLISER: Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon.\n\nJON: He could be lying.\n\nALLISER: Could be. There are ways to find out.\n\nJON: Where is he?\n\nALLISER: Over there.\n\nJon walks past a group of Brothers holding torches. He sees a sign that reads  TRAITOR  when he passes them, and turns to see he is cornered. Alliser stabs him in the gut.\n\nALLISER: For the Watch.\n\nAnother Brother stabs him.\n\nBROTHER: For the Watch.\n\nA third Brother stabs him.\n\nBROTHER: For the Watch.\n\nA fourth brother stabs him.\n\nBROTHER: For the Watch.\n\nA fifth brother stabs him.\n\nBROTHER: For the Watch.\n\nJon falls to his knees, struggling but still alive.

She gave it to me before I left for the Wall. You ... you shouldn't give it away. I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you. Keep it safe for me. Till I come back. ( Goats bleating ) ( Wolf panting ) Hodor. Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons. ( Gasps ) ( Breathing heavily ) Bran: Every night it's the same. I'm walking and running, but... I'm not ... I'm not me. I'm running through the Godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves. That's exactly what they are, Bran ... stories. So she was lying? They don't exist? Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more. No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream. What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? ( Clears throat ) Right. This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one Maester in 100 wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than 1,000 boys before me. ( Chuckles ) Come on. All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The Dragons are gone. The Giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten. ( Men shouting, cheering ) ( Grunting ) Loras! Highgarden! ( Grunts ) Get him! ( Gasps ) ( Grunts ) Crowd: Oh! Yield! I yield. Well fought. Approach. Rise. Remove your helm. ( Crowd murmuring ) You are all your father promised and more, My Lady. I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion. Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you. That he did, my Queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours. Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard. ( Crowd murmuring ) What? I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm. Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard. Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell. Lord of Winterfell and King in the North. Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife Margaery of House Tyrell? You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss. You are most kind. My Lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husband's murder. When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head. ( Cheering ) It will be enough to know that justice was done, My Lord. Brienne: Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King. There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest. Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet? I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you. If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts. My son is fighting a war, not playing at one. ( Men grumbling ) ( Chuckles ) Don't worry, My Lady. Our war is just beginning. ( Men shouting ) Your Grace. Gerard. How's your foot? Better, Your Grace. They don't know their own size is all. Good man. I have 100,000 men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach. And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them. Why? Because it won't last. Because they are the Knights of summer and winter is coming. Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey. At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after? That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone. If you'll follow me, My Lady. You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne. I fought for my King. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady. What are you doing here? I live here. Are you angry with me, brother? You lying bitch. It's not my fault you didn't recognize me. Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you... You looked like a fat little boy. You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to see who you were first. ( Laughs ) And I did. The plans are made. It's time you heard them. Father. Father. The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the north is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage as it was in the old days all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours ... forest, field and hall. Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships to attack Deepwood Motte. I've always wanted a castle. And what's my role in all this? You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore. A ship? You give her 30 and I get one? The sea bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you. I'm to fight fishermen? Be careful of their nets. Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily. They won't even know we're there until it's too late. What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior. Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect. I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock. What are our words? Our words? \"We do not sow.\" \"We do not sow.\" We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak. You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then? You gave me away! Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home. You'd have our father bow down to your other family? I have no other family. Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you. You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me ... Shh, shh, keep your voice down. Why? You think your father can hear me? He's 300 miles away! ( Sighs ) I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens. Again, only temporary. Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am. But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion. Scullion? What is a scullion? Kitchen wench. A kitchen wench? Yes, but ... Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me? Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you. I'm the weakness? It's a compliment, My Lady. How is being a weakness a compliment? Language can be a bit tricky here. Oh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench. When will Joffrey and Sansa be married? Soon, darling, when the war is over. Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory since you're the bride. The Princess just spoke to you. Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the Gods. Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother? He might. Would you like that? No. I don't think so. Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove? ( Knocking ) ( Gasps ) Come in. ( Door opens ) Who are you? I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden. I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here. No. What are you doing? Waiting for you to tell me what to do. I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them. What things? Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair. No. You said to brush ... Not now. Your chamber pot is empty. Clean the table. Have you ever been a handmaiden before? Yes. For whom? Lady Zuriff. Lady Zuriff? Lady Zuriff. There is no Lady Zuriff in this city. She wasn't in this city. Well, I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer 1,000 questions and teach you how to do your job. Do you want me to leave? Just brush my hair. Oh, thank the Gods. I haven't had a proper sh1t in six days. I've encountered this problem before, My Lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water daily. Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side. Please. Thank you, My Lord. I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not? Why, yes, of course, My Lord. These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony. Matrimony, huh? Yes. I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake. Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave. I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army should we need it. Myrcella sent away to Dorne? But remember, the queen mustn't know. Ooh, \"the queen mustn't know.\" I love conversations that begin this way. I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy. Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, My Lord,? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark. Precisely. Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the northern army from within and we can have his father's ships. But remember, you must tell no one. Tell no one what? I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones. She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess? For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think? And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement? Who better? Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me? The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal. Harrenhal is cursed. Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands. With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm. You served my family well in the matter of the succession. So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away. I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then? Good. Oh, and remember ... the queen mustn't know. ( Breathing heavily ) That must hurt. ( Groans ) What? What is it? ( Scoffs ) A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already. ( Sighs ) Brienne is a very capable warrior. And she's devoted to me. You're jealous. Jealous? Of Brienne the beauty? Don't make me laugh. I'll make it up to you. No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone. Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night. And Margaery's a virgin? Officially. Shall I bring her to you? I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine. As is your right. You are a King. You look very beautiful. Thank you, Your Grace. It's a lovely gown. You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way... or this way. You certainly don't need it. Although... some say that beauty most desired is the beauty concealed. Must be the wine. Here, let me. ( Shudders ) I'm sorry. Do you want my brother to come in and help? What? He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him. I don't know what you're talking about. There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them. Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it ... with me, with me and Loras. However else you like. Whatever you need to do. You are a King. Cersei: You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore? Myrcella's a Princess. Some would say she was born for this. I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon. Dorne is the safest place or her. Are you mad? The Martells loathe us. That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started. She'll be a hostage. A guest. You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too. It's done, Cersei. No. You cannot stop it. No! Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours. Get out! Get out! Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the drowned God? I would. Kneel. Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel. What is dead may never die. What is dead may never die... But rises again harder and stronger. Stand. ( Dog barking ) ( Footsteps approaching ) I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she? No, afraid not. Sorry about that. And Harrenhal ... I suppose that's off the table as well. Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too. Leave me out of your next deception. Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in. Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer. No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again? ( Footsteps approaching ) Find him? Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt. No, you don't. No, I don't. ( Door bursts ) ( Gasps ) What is the meaning of this? No, please, please. You disappoint me, Grand Maester. I am your loyal servant. So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne. No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the spider. See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you. The eunuch has spies everywhere. Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats. No, no, no. There are no goats, halfman. Well, make do. ( Whimpering ) How long have you been spying for my sister? All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King. I don't like his beard. What? What? Oh, no. No. ( Whimpering ) How many hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn? Lord Arryn, he knew. ( Stammering ) He knew the truth about the queen. And, well, he planned to act, to tell King Robert. So you poisoned him? No. Never. But you let him die, made sure he succumbed. Lannister ... I always served Lannister. Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells. Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me! For your trouble. ( Pycelle shouting ) You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service. Good. One of my better ideas. And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell. Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle ... the small council grows smaller every day. The council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave. Power is a curious thing, My Lord. Are you fond of riddles? Why, am I about to hear one? Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common Sellsword. Each great man bids the Sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies? Depends on the Sellsword. Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the Gods. He has a sword, the power of life and death. But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend Kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else? I've decided I don't like riddles. Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow. ( Crickets chirping ) ( Horse whinnies ) ( Snoring ) ( Door opens ) You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. 30 miles if it don't piss on us. I can't sleep. I don't like the taste. ( Chuckles ) Well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest. What? How do you sleep? Same as most men, I think. But you've seen things, horrible things. Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many. How do you sleep when you ... when you have those things in your head? You didn't see that. I made damn sure. I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there ... Joffrey, the Queen, and ... and my sister. You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lad's name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. But here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem ... oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a sh1t. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day... Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... that'll help you sleep, eh? ( Horn sounds ) ( Men shouting ) Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves. Gendry: Get up. Arya: Get up. Keep out of sight, both of you. No, I'm not afraid. I can fight. Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along North and don't look back. Hey, there's men out there who want to f*ck your corpses. Outside, now! Man: Come on, move, move! ( Horse whinnies ) Gold Cloaks! ( Shouting ) Everyone out! ( Shouting ) Hey, you! Open the damn cage! Where's the b*st*rd, Crow? Got more than a few bastards here. Who's asking? Ser Amory Lorch, sworn Bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister. These men from the capital requested our assistance. Drop your weapons in the name of the King. Now, which King would that be? This is your last chance. In the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons. ( Spits ) I don't think I will. So be it. ( Grunts ) I always hated crossbows. Take too long to load. ( Groans ) ( Gurgles ) Jaqen: Boy, come here. Boy! Sweet boy, help us. Come back here! Help us, boy! ( Shouting ) A man can fight! Free us! Quick, give it to me. Give me the ax. Give me that. Soldier: Put 'em on the wagon! There's more here. Come on. ( Grunts ) ( Chuckles ) What do we have here? No! That's a fine little blade. Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it. I yield! I yield! Amory: Round up any survivors. We'll take them back to Harrenhal. You heard him. You're coming with us. I yield! ( Whimpering ) Help! Help me! Something wrong with your leg, boy? Look at it. Can you walk? No. You got to carry me. All right. ( Coughing ) Carry him, he says. ( Laughs ) We're looking for a b*st*rd named Gendry. Give him up or I'll start taking eyeballs. You want Gendry? You already got him. He loved that helmet. ( Theme music playing )", "episode_12": "Cersei: What are you doing here? Varys: Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead. You brought this on yourself. I've done nothing. Do you understand we're losing the war? Does it ever end? Jorah: Everything ends, even the Red Waste. ( Daenerys speaking Dothraki ) Dolorus Edd: All the other wildlings for 100 leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. Dolorus Edd: He marries his daughters and they give him more daughters. What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons? Matthos: \"My brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, the boy Joffrey being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros.\" Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm. Robb: I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms. You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well. We won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail. Men who fought my father. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally. I need his ships. He is not trustworthy. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime and you. Father had other children. What are you asking? Joffrey: How many bastards does he have running around? ( Screaming ) Where is the b*st*rd? The Night's Watch! Heading north! ( Theme music playing ) ? Game of Thrones 2x02 ? The Night Lands Original Air Date on April 8, 2012 ? ( Urinating ) ( Birds chittering ) ( Rustling ) ( Urinating stops ) ( Men chattering ) ( Horse neighs ) Man: Gotta be ready before nightfall. Man #2: Okay, keep moving. Man: Put a watch on the Ridge and the tree lines. Man #3: Boy. Lovely boy. What do you want? A man has a thirst. A man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend. I have friends. ( Clangs ) Give us beer before I skin you. A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. You're called Arry? This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar, once of the free city of ... Beer, you little sh1t. Get us beer! You should have asked nicely. Aah! Come closer and I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and f*ck you bloody. A boy has more courage than sense. Come here! Yoren said none of us were to go near those three. Come here! They don't scare me. Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me. ( Horse neighs ) What are Gold Cloaks doing so far from King's Landing? What are you doing? They're looking for me. You in command here? You're a long way from home. I asked you a question. Aye, you did. You asked without manners and I chose not to answer. I have a royal warrant for one of these gutter rats you're transporting. Well, the thing is... These gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch. Now, that puts them beyond the reach of Kings and Queens. Does it? It's a funny thing ... people worry so much about their throats that they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to or I could nick this artery in your leg. And once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to unnick it. We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the Wall. Seems you have a choice ... you can die here at this crossroads a long way from home, or you can go back to your city and tell your Masters you didn't find what you were looking for. We're looking for a boy named Gendry. He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back with more men and I'll be taking your head home along with that b*st*rd boy. ( Horse neighs ) ( Men murmuring ) ( Whistling ) ( Distant seagulls screeching ) ( Bells pealing ) ( Whistling ) ( Distant seagulls ( Shae laughing ) My Lord. You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company. We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces. It was quite a battle. I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors. And I tell him the story of how we meet. To find so lovely a creature working in your father's kitchens ... it almost beggars belief. Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie. I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie. How can you tell? I can always tell. Tyrion: Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy, My Lord. I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends. Your discretion is legendary... where your friends are concerned. How unspeakable of me to go on and on when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. Welcome to King's Landing, my dear. This city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, My Lord. I don't like threats. Who threatened you? I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played. Ned Stark was a man of honor. And I am not. Threaten me again and I'll have you thrown into the sea. You might be disappointed in the results. Storms come and go, the big fish eat the little fish, and I keep on paddling. Come, My Lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting. Cersei: \"From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent kingdom of the North.\" He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that. You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. We can give him his father's bones back at least as a gesture of good faith. You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin? I will, Your Grace. Did you see my brother when you were the Starks' guest? Alton: I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace. If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten. Alton: I will, Your Grace. Safe travels, cousin. You have a deft hand with diplomacy. If that's everything... A ... a raven flew in this morning from Castle Black. Trouble with the wildlings. That's why they're called \"wildlings.\" Somewhat less wild these days. Seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall. Another king? How many is that now, five? ( Laughs ) I've lost count. The Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man the Wall. Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare. \"The cold winds are rising and the dead rise with them.\" The northerners are a superstitious people. According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. Mormont doesn't lie. Varys: How do you kill a dead man? Apparently you burn him. One trip to the Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you ... the Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall. I have every confidence that the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all. Dolorous Edd: And I said, \"if the Gods wanted us to have dignity, they wouldn't make us fart when we died.\" Grenn: We fart when we die? Dolorous Edd: My blessed mother ... I was holding her hand when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook. ( Blowing raspberry ) Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two or three be enough for him? We were having a serious discussion. Would you look at that? Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away. I prefer watching them come towards me. I'm sure that's nice, too. Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. We were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older and the wrestling, uh... Changed. Sam: You were with her? How many times? Well, as many times as I could. I wish I grew up on a farm. We need more potatoes. Get another sack from the sledge. Get the turnips, too. ( Dog barking ) ( Woman screams ) No. Ghost, no. No! Ghost, away. Shoo, shoo! You all right? Did he frighten you? You ... you shouldn't touch me. Oh. Oh, right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. You're very brave. What are you doing? This is Gilly. She's one of Craster's... daughters. Hello, Gilly. What are you doing? Sam said you could help. I'm sorry, but Sam knows we're not supposed ... She's pregnant. Have to take her with us when we leave. What? What would that ... Sam: I know it sounds a bit mad. No, it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible. The Lord Commander ordered us to ... We are sworn to protect. Sam, we can't take ... please, ser, please. I can still run if I have to. It's just not possible. I'm going to have a baby. If it's a boy... If it's a boy, what? You want us to risk our lives for you and you won't even tell us why? Why'd you do that? Do what? Ask her a question? You were cruel. Cruel? Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand? I didn't touch her. No, you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that? I can't steal her. She's a person, not a goat. We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's going to deliver a baby, you? I could try. What? I've read about it. A bit. I'm sorry, Sam. We can't help her. ( Sighs ) ( Insects chittering, buzzing ) ( Sighs ) ( Hoofbeats approaching ) Khaleesi. ( Horse neighs ) ( Breathing heavily ) ( Flies buzzing ) You don't need to see this. He is blood of my blood. Who did this? Khal Pono, perhaps. Khal Jhaqo. They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasar. They will like it far less when I am done with them. ( Weeping ) ( Speaking Dothraki ) ( Sobbing ) ( Irri wailing ) ( Seagulls screeching ) Is it as you remember, My Lord? It looks smaller. Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it. ( Giggles ) They'll be waiting for me on the docks. Who will? Anyone who matters. This is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place, the Iron Islands. Always has been. It's cold and it's wet. Oh, I love the cold and wet. They say hard places breed hard men. And hard men rule the world. Then you'll be king before long. Try smiling with your lips closed. Better. My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders. I don't blame him. He says that you're all reavers and rapers and that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be sat ... uh! ( Grunts ) Quit talking about your father. ( Moans ) But he's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take salt wives ... the women we capture. Capture me. Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your salt wife. Your place is on this ship. Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore. I haven't paid you. ( Both grunting ) ( Moaning ) Oh, yeah. ( Jewelry jangling ) ( Door opens ) Man: I paid good money... ( Door slams ) ( Man grumbling ) I'm not going to stand for this. ( Woman crying ) I barely touched her. Now, you charge twice as much as every other brothel and this is what I get ... crying. One moment, my friend. A moment. ( Snaps fingers ) Please accept my sincerest apologies. Aremca will take good care of you. ( Crying continues ) I'm sorry, My Lord. Shh, shh. Did he hurt you? No, My Lord. ( Sniffles ) It's Mhaegen. Who? She works for you. She's the one ... the Gold Cloaks, they killed her baby. Ah, yes. That was... poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace. I can't stop thinking about it. I can't sleep. That poor little baby. You know, you remind me of another girl, a lovely thing I once acquired from a Lysene pleasure house ... beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent, like yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried often. I asked her why, but we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from the Lysene pleasure houses are expensive, extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I ... I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that... Would never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy, but my losses were definitely mitigated. Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. And you'll be happy? That makes me happy. ( Distant hoofbeats ) ( People chattering ) ( Crying ) Tyrion: More wine? Janos: Damn it, boy! Apologies, My Lord. Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine. That's your new squire? I could've found you a proper lad. Myself, I prefer the improper ones. Mm, that's a good red. Dornish? You know your wines, My Lord. That I do. ( Sighs ) A fine dinner, My Lord. Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord. Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours. Wars have been started for less. ( Both laugh ) I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night. Mm, nasty business. Had to be done. Yes, of course. The City Watch must keep the peace, only I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies. Orders are orders. Quite right. Especially the queen's orders. I never said they were the queen's orders. No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman. You know your sister better than I do. You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister? I don't listen to filth. That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children. Joffrey is my king. The rest doesn't interest me. I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me, when your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men in the throne room, did you give the order? I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty. The fool. He had no idea you were already bought. Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp! I'm not questioning Your Honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence. If you think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf ... Dwarf? Mm, you should have stopped at Imp. And, yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here. I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war. And seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about. What are you t ... my friends at court will not allow this! The queen herself has granted ... The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she is your friend. We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this. No, we shan't. ( Footsteps approach ) ( Doors open ) There's a ship leaving for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight. From there I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful... In a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way. The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, My Lord. These men are under my command! I command you to arrest this cutthroat. His name is Bronn and he is the new commander of the City Watch. Boys. ( Janos grunting ) I have friends at court, powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord! To the new Commander. If I told you to murder an infant girl, say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question? Without question? No. I'd ask, \"how much?\" ( Chatter ) ( Horse neighs ) If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. Don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle. I ain't afraid of no battles. If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants. I've seen lots of battles. I saw ... Liar. I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck. Two men fighting isn't a battle. They had armor on. So? So, if they've got armor on, it's a battle. No, it isn't. What does a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway? Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot pie, tell Gendry what makes a fight into a battle. It's, um, when they've got armor on. Gendry: Who told you that? A knight. How'd you know he was a knight? Well, it was 'cause he got armor on. You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. Hot pie: How do you know? 'Cause I sold armor. What do the Gold Cloaks want with you? No idea. You're a liar. You know, you shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you. Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. I don't care what any of them want. No good's ever come of their questions. No good's ever come? Who asked questions before? How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass? Who asked questions? The Hand of the King. Hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first a few weeks before he died, and then Lord Stark came a few weeks before he died. Lord Stark? See? Asking me questions is bad luck. You'll probably be dead soon. What did they ask about? My mom. Who's your mom? Just my mom ... worked in a tavern, died when I was little. And who was your father? Could've been one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you anyway? You thought they were after you. Why? Did you kill someone or is it just because you're a girl? I'm not a girl. Yes, you are. Do you think I'm as stupid as the rest of them? Stupider. The Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that. Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl. I am not! Yeah? Well, pull your cock out and take a piss, then. I don't need to take a piss. Lommy and hot pie can't know. No one can know. Well, they won't, not from me. My name's not Arry. It's Arya... of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell. He was your father ... the Hand, the traitor. He was never a traitor. Joffrey is a liar. So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady. No. I mean, yes. My mother was a lady and my sister ... Yeah, but you were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle and you ... look, all that about cocks, I should never have said ... and I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I ... I should be calling you \"My Lady.\" Do not call me \"My Lady.\" As My Lady commands. Well, that was unladylike. Oh! ( Laughs ) ( Seagulls screeching ) ( Chatter ) ( Hammers banging ) What's she carrying? Myrish oranges, wine from the Arbor... And the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands. The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. Me. I don't like wine. Woman's drink. I need to get to Pyke. I'll find you a horse. I'm heading that way. I can take you there. I bet you can. Have you been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from? None like you. You don't know what I'm like. Maybe you don't know what you're like. Maybe you need someone to teach you. Do you know who I am? You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry, Lord Greyjoy? Have my things sent up to the castle. You should give me the reins. I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the past nine years. Nine years? Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope? Don't you worry about my hands. The sea is in my blood. Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going. I have a proposal for my father, one that will make him king again, and me after him. You may get to stay in a castle tonight if you're lucky. Is that an offer from my future king? An order from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night. Woman: I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children. ( Footsteps approaching ) Theon: Father. Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back? A man. Your blood and your heir. We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did. Lord Stark is gone. And how do you feel about that? What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark. Who gave you those clothes? Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter? If my clothes offend you, I will change them. You will. That bauble 'round your neck ... did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold? Gold. I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. ( Necklace clinks ) My fears have come true ... the Starks have made you theirs. My blood is salt and iron. Yet the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven clutching his message. The offer he makes is one I proposed. He heeds your counsel? I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side. He thinks of me as a brother. No, not here, not in my hearing. You will not name him brother, this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood? I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king. I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me king of the Iron Islands once again. I will lead the attack myself. Oh, you will? I'm your son, your only living heir. Who else? ( Door opens ) I told you to wait outside. How did you get past the guards? Anything with a cock is easy to fool. My dear. Yara? So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about. She can't lead an attack! Balon: And why not? You're a woman! You're the one in skirts. This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him. All: What's dead may never die. The only nights she's spent off these islands have been spent on the sea. She's commanded men. She's killed men. She knows who she is. No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown, for that is who I am. That is who we have always been. You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own. Who said anything about the Lannisters? Davos: You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing. Salladhor: All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance? Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false King Joffrey. And yet they both have larger armies. Stannis has just begun the fight. His Bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon or more worthy of loyalty. What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings? Mind your words, pirate. Matthos. You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises. Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise ... a promise that somewhere on the sea, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from him. That's a promise that always comes true. As is mine. You're not a young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong ... most pirates don't grow old. Only the clever ones. You want to spend your last few years on the sea stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Meereenese silk merchants? Then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lys and the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing. \"Salladhor Saan\" is a good name for songs. It is. One thing ... I want the queen. The queen? Cersei ... I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships. And if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will f*ck this blonde queen and I'll f*ck her well. This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen. I'm not going to rape her. I'm going to f*ck her. As if she would just let you. You don't know how persuasive I am. I've never tried to f*ck you. Stannis is the rightful king and the Lord of Light, the one true God ... ( Groans ) I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true Gods. They all think they found the right one. The one true God is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet, a queen's legs. I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son. Eh, he's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen. You believe your king can win? He is the one true king. You Westerosi are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. ( Laughs ) I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You're the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich. Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will. Matthos: When will the king have us sail? As soon as his God wills it. He's my God, too, and yours, but you are too blind to see. Let me teach you how to read. Oh, you and your mother. It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be. I wish I had a God, truly. I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is ... pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works. But you always came home. I wasn't praying. No, but I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed for you. You want me to have a God? Fine. King Stannis is my God. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read. You'll be a knight someday. You think a fire God commanded all that? It was Stannis, only Stannis. Stannis is my king, but he's only a man. Don't tell him that. ( Laughs ) Cersei: Lord Janos Slynt was commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him. I have every right. I am the King's Hand. You're serving as the King's Hand till father gets here. I am Queen Regent. Listen to me, Queen Regent. You're losing the people. Do you hear me? ( Laughs ) The people. You think I care? You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them their rallying cry ... \"The Queen slaughters babies.\" You don't even have the decency to deny it. It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse. He did what needed to be done. You want to be Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is ... lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root, one by one, before they strangle you in your sleep. I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling than that. I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. It's all fallen on me. As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon. You're funny. You've always been funny... But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember? Back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death? She was my mother, too. Mother gone... For the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. ( Waves crashing, seagulls screeching ) ( Door opens ) Your Grace. Your Grace. Stannis: How did you fare with your pirate? Salladhor Saan will join our fleet ... 30 ships. His men know how to fight. In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men. It does seem the wiser choice. There won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him? Salladhor Saan is an old friend. I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him, but once he gets the smell of gold, he never stops. Well, if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us. At once, Your Grace. The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior. ( Whispering ) Come. ( Doors close ) What did you say to him? I told him death by fire is the purest death. Why? Because it is true. You're troubled, my king. Yeah. These armies are toys for the Lord of Light. Tell your lord to burn them, then. I tell him nothing. I pray for his commands and I obey. My little brother has 100,000 men according to the scouts, men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me. You must have faith. Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of 10. Then we must be the 10th. I cannot defeat my brother in the field. And I can't take King's Landing without the men he's stolen. I have seen the path to victory in the flames. But first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light. I've said the words, damn you. I burnt the idols. You must give all of yourself. I have a wife. I took a vow. She's sickly, weak... Shut away in a tower. She disgusts you. And she's given you nothing ... no sons, only stillborns, only death. I will give you a son, my king. A son?

I have a son, you have a daughter, we'll join our houses. May I present Viserys of House Targaryen and his sister Daenerys? I give him a queen and he gives me an army. Maester says the boy may live. My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on. You know how much I love my family. There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. King Robert's bastards ... Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why? The King has no trueborn sons. Do you love your children? With all my heart. No more than I love mine. And they're all Jaime's. When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. No! No! A crown for a king. He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill the dragon. Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward. He wants to groom you for command. Ned! We were hunting. By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us. What about Stannis? He's your older brother. This isn't about the bloody line of succession. He's not a king. I am. We have a new king now. Your son has no claim to the throne. Kill him! Kill all of them! I command it! You're summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king. Joffrey puts my father in chains; Now he wants his ass kissed? I'll go to King's Landing, but not alone. Call the Banners. Kill him, Robb. He's more use to us alive than dead. So long as I am your king, treason shall never go unpunished. No! No! Stop, my son. You will go to King's Landing and serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You'll bring that boy king to heel, and his mother, too, if needs be. Please let me go home. Mother says I'm still to marry you, so you'll stay here and obey. My sword is yours in victory and defeat. The King in the North! The King in the North! What's your name? Arry. Arry the orphan boy. It's 1,000 leagues from here to the Wall. We ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers, and whatever else is out there. He will die tonight, Khaleesi. Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. You don't understand. Blood of my blood. ? Game of Thrones 2x01 ? The North Remembers Original Air Date on April 1, 2012 Well struck. Well struck, Dog. Did you like that? It was well struck, Your Grace. I already said it was well struck. Yes, Your Grace. Who's next? Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish. Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard. Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard! Here I am. Here I am. Sorry, Your Grace. My deepest apologies. Are you drunk? No. Uh, no. No, Your Grace. I had two cups of wine. Two cups? That's not much at all. Please, have another cup. Are you sure, Your Grace? Yes. To celebrate my name day. Have two. Have as much as you like. I would be honored, Your Grace. Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day. See that he drinks his fill. You can't. What did you say? Did you say I can't? I only meant it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day. What kind of stupid peasant's superstition... The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day he reaps all year. Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool. He is. A fool ... you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death. Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? From this day, you'll be my new fool. Thank you, Your Grace. And you, My Lady, thank you. Beloved nephew. We looked for you on the battlefield. You were nowhere to be found. I've been here, ruling the kingdoms. What a fine job you've done. Look at you. More beautiful than ever. And you! You ... you're going to be bigger than the hound, but much better looking. This one doesn't like me. Can't imagine why. We heard you were dead. I'm glad you're not dead. Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss. Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor. But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize. My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey. Of course you are. Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done. What work? Why are you here? The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done at last. The longest summer in living memory. The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter. A common superstition. We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, we'll have fewer peasants. The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them. And with winter coming, it'll only get worse. You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt? I do, Your Grace. And are you not a Lord at my command? I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace. Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital. Yes, Your Grace. Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption. Carry on. What are you doing here? Ah, it's been a remarkable journey. I pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell, I fought with the hill tribes ... so many adventures, so much to be thankful for. What are you doing here? This is the small council. Yes. well I, do believe, the Hand of the King, is welcome at all small council meetings. Our father is Hand of the King. Yes, but in his absence... Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights. Out! All of you out! I would like to know how you tricked father into this. If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. I've done nothing. Quite right ... you did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us. I tried to stop it. Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation. Robb Stark is a child. Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war? What do you know about warfare? Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us. Joffrey is King. Joffrey is King. You are here to advise him. I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back. How? You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them. One. One? Arya, little animal ... she disappeared. Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you... to be the disappointing child. My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons. The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall. Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast. Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war. King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it. Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners and took the men. Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser? Of course I remember! We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls? I ... I believe it will. We didn't want him here all day, did we? I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb. Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. Lord Portan. My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons. Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away. Don't have any pain. Lucky for you. That way. You've been having those dreams again. I don't dream. Everyone dreams. I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South. Did they? I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. Heard a stableboy say it's the color of blood to mark the death of your father. The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy ... dragons. The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi? He said they ate meat. He didn't tell you what kind of meat? My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything. Eh. She was Drogo's first gift to me. I remember. I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream? A trick I never learned, I'm afraid. Does it ever end? This is farther east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste. And you're sure there's no other way? If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons. No one will take my dragons. They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength. As you are mine. Rakharo... You never have. This is bad time to start. Having a rough time of it? Nothing's killed me yet. Your ass killed the sledge. You offered me a ride. I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters. I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times. Are those girls? Craster's daughters. I haven't seen a girl in six months. I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you. What, he don't like people messing with his daughters? He don't like people messing with his wives. He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters. And on and on it goes. That's foul. It's beyond foul. All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right. What happens to the boys? Hmm? He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons? He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs. People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that. We're not Southerners. Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name? Jon Snow. Snow, eh? Listen to me, b*st*rd. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North. The lad meant no harm. I catch that pretty little b*st*rd talking to my daughters ... No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. Now, sit down and shut your mouth. You bring any of that good wine with you? We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone? I could tell you, but I'm thirsty. There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here. Yes, commander. You want to know where they've all gone? North... to join up with Mance Rayder... Your old friend. He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers. Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall. He's been calling himself that for years. What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere? That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged? Give it here. You'll have another one made at Castle Black. Here. Oh, that's some lovely steel. You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings. And where does he plan marching this army? When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go. These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising. Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. Wife... tell the Lord Crow how content we are. This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave. Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed? We chose different paths. Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs. A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you. Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out. Your roof, your rules. Who am I?! Who am I?! Lord commander. And who are you? Jon Snow. Who are you? Your steward. You want to lead one day? Then learn how to follow. Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false Gods. Take them and cast your light upon us... For the night is dark and full of terrors. For the night is dark and full of terrors. After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world. The stars will bleed. We need to stop her. The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas... Not now. ...And the dead shall rise in the North. All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors? You smell of fear ... fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me. In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you. Lord, cast your light upon us! For the night is dark and full of terrors. For the night is dark and full of terror. This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win. Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path. King. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation. I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis. As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. If you tell him the truth... What's the truth? \"And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert ... \" he wasn't my beloved brother. I didn't love him. He didn't love me. A harmless courtesy, Your Grace. A lie. Take it out. \"...that my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth ... \" Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is. \"...And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, i do this day lay claim ... \" Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight. \"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. Let all true men declare their loyalty.\" When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse. Your Grace,the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother ... I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King. Well, many have already declared for him ... Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly. Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him. And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet? He has no need for ships. I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark. Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them. I owe you an apology, my King. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together? Don't. A cup of wine to honor the one true God. The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace. King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl. If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message: \"Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.\" You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle? Oh, I trust them with my life, just not with yours. Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called \"boy\"? Insulted? You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy. You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. He's your b*st*rd son. If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him. My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed. I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head. Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you ... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen. You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives? I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms. You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well. No, but he's starting to know me. Three victories don't make you a conqueror. It's better than three defeats. This city stinks... Like dead bodies. A bit corpsey, yes. And sh1t. I thought you wanted to come here. I love it. You love the smell of dead bodies and sh1t? And cum and garlic and rum. You can smell cum from the balcony? I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to f*ck. And so did the country. This is where I belong. Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here. No one will know. You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars ... good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars. What about you? Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth. Truth? You are the biggest little liar I have ever met. Why do you think I am so little? I'm being crushed beneath the weight of all that truth. Oh! Ned Stark actually slept on this. As if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here. Lord Baelish. Your Grace. I wonder if I might ask you for a favor. Of course, Your Grace. Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya ... we can't seem to locate her. If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination. And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her. Curious. If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her ... well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts. Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it... Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. Who knows what they want? A mockingbird. You created your own Sigil, didn't you? Yes. Appropriate... for a self-made man with so many songs to sing. I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way. I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another. When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation indeed, especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found. And which truth is that? Knowledge is power. Seize him. Cut his throat. Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it. You're Ser Alton Lannister? I am, Your Grace. I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals. An honorable request, Your Grace. Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom. The King in the North. King in the North. Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me. These are ... Your Grace, these are ... these are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not... I will litter the south with Lannister dead. King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace. Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight. A word, Your Grace? You don't have to call me \"Your Grace\" when no one's around. It's not so bad once you get used to it. I'm glad someone's gotten used to it. The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know? Of course they are. We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them. Men who fought my father. Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together. You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally. I need his ships. They say he has 200. They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us? I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy. I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion. Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another. I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten. If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet. You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya ... I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them? It's more complicated than that! You know it is. It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months. You can't go to Winterfell. I beg your pardon? I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys because tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands. Why in the name of all the Gods ... because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family. I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords ... Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home... for good. I will ride at first light. We will all be together again soon, I promise. You've done so well. Your father would be... proud. Give Lord Renly my regards. King Renly. There's a king in every corner now. What is all this? Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens ... they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers. We can't find Arya Stark. With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere. Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone. I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather ... The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place. His life is in danger. We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you. Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne. It's not a claim. The throne is mine. Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip. Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella? What are you asking? I'm asking if he f*cked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running ... What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. That will be all, Mother. No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion. Oh, yeah. Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight. We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall. Haystack Hall. Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here. Littlefinger's a fancy man. Don't call him Littlefinger. He doesn't like it. Lord Baelish. She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom. She's beautiful. She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. Lord Commander. Good to see you... Again. You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin... Coin which goes in many pockets. Orders. Whose orders? Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks. No, you can't. No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please. Enough. Get it done. Kill the b*st*rd. No, no! Please. Give it here. No, please. Spread out. Search every house. Every room. Look in every room. People shouting ) Gendry! His name is Gendry. Where is the b*st*rd? The Night's Watch! Please, stop! Where? They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north. How will we know him? He's got a bull's head helmet. He made it himself. Find him. ( Theme music playing )", "episode_10": "\n\nWe begin where  Baelor  left off; after the execution of Ned Stark, we see Ilyn Payne s bloodied sword and the Hound picking up Ned s head to show it to the rapturous townsfolk. We then pan to Arya, her eyes closed and her face pressed against Yoren s chest.\n\nYoren:  Look at me. Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy. You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.\n\nYoren takes Arya with him away from the mob and into a flight of stairs; on the courtyard, Sansa faints.\n\nYoren:  Keep your mouth shut, boy. (takes out a knife)\nArya Stark:  l'm not a boy!\nYoren:  You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! (starts cutting Arya s hair as the screams and shouts from the crowd are heard above) North, boy, we're going north.\n\n------------------------------------------\nAt Winterfell, Bran has a dream in which he can walk and sees a three-eyed raven. He then talks about this dream with Osha.\n\nBran Stark:  lt had three eyes. lt told me to come with him, so l did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there.\nOsha:  Your father's not down there, little lord. Not for many years yet.\nBran Stark:  You're afraid. Just like Hodor.\nOsha:  l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.\nBran Stark:  You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.\n\nOsha takes Bran to the crypts. She carries him with her arms while he lights the way with a torch.\nBran Stark:  That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father.\nOsha:  You see? He's not here.\n\nA loud roar is heard and a shadow moves in front of them. A direwolf runs towards them; Osha falls to the ground with him. We see Shaggydog barking at them viciously.\nRickon Stark:  Here, Shaggydog.\nBran Stark:  Rickon!\nOsha:  That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!\nRickon Stark:  He doesn't like chains.\nBran Stark:  What are you doing down here? Come back up with us.\nRickon Stark:  No, l came to see Father.\nBran Stark:  How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.\nRickon Stark:  He was down here. l saw him.\nBran Stark:  Saw him when?\nRickon Stark:  Last night, when l was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog.\n\nRickon leaves with Shaggydog, while Osha looks puzzled at Bran. We cut to a shot of her carrying him outside.\n\nOsha:  You both miss him. lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that  \nMaester Luwin:  Bran \n\n--------------------------------------\nCatelyn Stark walks alone through the Stark camp. Several bannermen bow to her respectfully as she passes.\n\nSeveral Stark Bannermen:  My lady. My lady. My lady.\n\nShe reaches a small forest outside camp and collapses in grief by one of the trees, crying and sobbing. She hears some screams and the sound of a sword slashing wood nearby. As she gets closer, she realizes it s Robb, fully armoured, slashing his sword against a tree while crying.\n\nCatelyn Stark:  Robb. Robb! You've ruined your sword.\nRobb drops his sword to the ground and goes to Catelyn. She hugs him and caresses his neck, trying to console him.\nCatelyn Stark:  Shh! Shh! Shh!\nRobb Stark:  l'll kill them all. Every one of them. l will kill them all.\nCatelyn Stark:  My boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.\n\n-------------------------------------\nAt the Throne Room on the Red Keep, Marillion the bard is singing a song for Joffrey and his retinue. Cercei stands by his side, while Sansa overlooks the scene from one of the colonnades.\n\nMarillion:  (singing)\nThe boar's great tusks, they boded ill\nFor good King Robert's health\nAnd the beast was every bit as fat\nAs Robert was himself\nBut our brave king cried,\n\"Do your worst!\nl'll have your ugly head!\nYou're nowhere near as murd'rous as\nthe lion in my bed\"\nKing Robert lost his battle and\nHe failed his final test,\nThe lion ripped his balls off,\nAnd the boar did all the rest.\n\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Very amusing. lsn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition. l imagine it was even better received at that tavern.\nMarillion:  l'm so sorry, Your Grace. l'll never sing it again, l swear.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Tell me, which do you favor - your fingers or your tongue?\nMarillion:  Your Grace?\nSansa looks at Joffrey, despondent.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat.\nMarillion:  Every man needs hands, Your Grace.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Good. Tongue it is.\nMarillion:  Your Grace, please. l won't sing, Your Grace.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Ser llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?\nMarillion:  l beg you! Please, no. No!\nIlyn Payne marches towards the fire to heat up his dagger.\nMarillion:  Your Grace, please. l beg you, l will never sing again!

Marillion is still screaming and begging in the background.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  You look quite nice.\nSansa Stark:  Thank you, my lord.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Your Grace. l'm King now.\nMarillion:  (screaming) Stop! No!\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Walk with me. l want to show you something.\nSandor Clegane:  Do as you're bid, child.\n\nJoffrey and Sansa are outside, walking past across a row of spears in the Red Keep. Trant and Clegane follow behind them.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  And as soon as you've had your blood, l'll put a son in you. Mother says that shouldn't be long.\nThe pikes have impaled heads on them. Sansa looks away.\nSansa Stark:  No! Please, no!\nJoffrey Baratheon:  (pointing at one of the heads) This one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors.\nSansa Stark:  You promised to be merciful.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  l was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him.\nSansa Stark:  Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear  \nJoffrey Baratheon:  Mother says l'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here, and obey. Look at him!\nSansa looks up at the head of her father.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Well?\nSansa Stark:  How long do l have to look?\nJoffrey Baratheon:  As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?\nSansa Stark:  lf it please Your Grace.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  That's your Septa there. (shot of the impaled head of a woman with the traditional Septa headscarf) l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present. After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well.\nSansa Stark:  Or maybe he'll give me yours. (looks defiantly at Joffrey, who cowers)\nJoffrey Baratheon:  My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady. Ser Meryn.Ser Meryn strikes Sansa repeatedly with the back of his (armoured) hand, leaving her lip bloodied. Sansa notices the stone bridge Joffrey is on leads to a street some feet below. She moves forward to lunge him from the edge, but she s stopped by the Hound.\nSandor Clegane:  Here, girl. (cleans her bloody lip with a rag)\nJoffrey Baratheon:  Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.\nSandor Clegane:  Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants.\nSansa tries to give him is handkerchief back.\nSandor Clegane:  You'll be needing that again.\nSandor leaves, leaving Sansa alone at the bridge. She looks at the heads atop the pikes and cries.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nWar meeting at the Stark camp. They sit at the table at night by torchlight.\n\nJonos Bracken:  The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.\nRobb Stark:  Renly is not the king.\nJonos Bracken:  You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord. He put your father to death.\nRobb Stark:  That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis.\nJonos Bracken:  Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?\nGalbart Glover:  Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis \nGreatjon Umber:  My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North! (The Greatjon bows to Robb with his sword unsheathed; Robb rises)\nRickard Karstark:  l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too.

Leave us.\nThey walk for a while until they reach a single prisoner (Jaime), kept away far from the rest.\nCatelyn Stark:  Leave us. (the guards leave)\nJaime Lannister:  You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. (Catelyn grabs a large rock from the ground)  Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. (She marches towards him and hits the rock against his forehead)   Oh, l do like a violent woman.\nCatelyn Stark:  l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.\nJaime Lannister:  Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long.\nCatelyn Stark:  That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death.\nJaime Lannister:  But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?\nCatelyn Stark:  Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.\nJaime Lannister:  What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?\nCatelyn Stark:  Because of men like you.\nJaime Lannister:  There are no men like me. Only me.\nCatelyn Stark:  My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?\nJaime Lannister:  l pushed him out the window.\nCatelyn Stark:  Why?\nJaime Lannister:  I hoped the fall would kill him.\nCatelyn Stark:  Why?\nJaime Lannister:  You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war. (Catelyn drops the rock and goes away)\n\n-----------------------------------------\nCersei and Lancel are having one of their rendezvous on her bedchamber. Cersei is reading a message while Lancel speaks, naked.\n\nLancel Lannister:  l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?\nCersei Lannister:  Stop talking. Get back into bed.\n\n-----------------------------------------\nBack in the Riverlands, we sit with the Lannister war meeting. Tywin, Tyrion and Kevan are in assistance.\n\nTywin Lannister:  They have my son.\nTyrion Lannister:  The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.\nLeo Lefford:  l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.\nAddam Marbrand:  ls it true about Stannis and Renly?\nKevan Lannister:  Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace.\nTyrion Lannister:  There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning   in case you hadn't noticed.\nKevan Lannister:  l'm told we still have his sisters.\nLeo Lefford:  The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.\nAddam Marbrand: Kevan Lannister:  First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise  \nTywin Lannister:  (shouting)  They have my son! Get out, all of you. (to Tyrion) Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now   madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong. \nTyrion Lannister:  Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.\nTywin Lannister:  No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.\nTyrion Lannister:  And do what?\nTywin Lannister:  Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest   Baelish, Varys, Pycelle \nTyrion Lannister:  Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?\nTywin Lannister:  You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?\n\n-------------------------------------------\nAcross the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is sleeping inside a yurt. Jorah is sitting beside her when she wakes up.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Ser Jorah?\nJorah Mormont:  Gently, gently.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  My son   where is he? l want him. Where is he?\nJorah Mormont:  The boy did not live.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Tell me.\nJorah Mormont:  What is there to tell?\nDaenerys Targaryen:  How did my son die?\nJorah Mormont:  He never lived, my princess. The women say  \nDaenerys Targaryen:  What do the women say?\nJorah Mormont:  They say the child was  \nMirri Maz Duur:  (entering the tent) Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.\nMirri Maz Duur:  As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him.\nJorah Mormont:  Time enough for that later  \nDaenerys Targaryen:  l want to see him now.\n\nThey leave the tent/yurt, following Mirri Maz Duur to the place where Drogo is lying.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  The khalasar is gone.\nJorah Mormont:  A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Drogo! (in Dothraki) My sun and stars. (in the Common Tongue, to the rest) Why is he out here alone?\nJorah Mormont:  He seems to like the warmth, Princess.\nMirri Maz Duur:  He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  (looking at Drogo s catatonic expression) This is not life. When will he be as he was?\nMirri Maz Duur:  When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Leave us.\nJorah Mormont:  l don't want you alone with this sorceress.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.\nDaenerys and Mirri Maz Duur have a conversation alone.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.\nMirri Maz Duur:  lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  This is not God's work. My child was innocent.\nMirri Maz Duur:  lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  l spoke for you. l saved you.\nMirri Maz Duur:  Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my god's house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Your life.\nMirri Maz Duur:  Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.\n\n------------------------------\n\nAt Castle Black, Jon is preparing to leave in the night and desert the Night s Watch; Sam is there to try to talk him out of it.\n\nSamwell Tarly:  You can't!\nJon Snow:  Get out of my way, Sam.\nSamwell Tarly:  They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?\nJon Snow:  Better than you do.\nSamwell Tarly:  What are you going to do?\nJon Snow:  l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat. (gets on horseback)\nSamwell Tarly:  You can't leave us now. We need you here.\nJon Snow:  Move.\nSamwell Tarly:  l won't let you go.\nJon Snow:  Move.\nSamwell Tarly:  No.\nJon Snow:  Hyah!\nJon rides his horse away from Castle Black, his horse kicking Sam to the ground as he was standing in the way. Ghost follows him out.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nIn the Lannister camp in the Riverlands, Tyrion and Shae are talking inside his tent about his recent appointment.\nShae:  Hand of the King?\nTyrion Lannister:  So it would seem.\nShae:  And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?\nTyrion Lannister:  No, he said l couldn't take  you with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point.\nShae:  He knew my name?\nTyrion Lannister:  What?\nShae:  He said, \"Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing\"?\nTyrion Lannister:  l believe he used the word \"whore\".\nShae:  Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?\nTyrion laughs.\nShae:  I m funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore.\nTyrion Lannister:  My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand   (Shae kisses Tyrion)\nShae:  l know what a Hand needs.\n\n------------------------------------\nJon and Ghost are being chased by his fellow Night s Watch brothers through a forest not long after he left.\nJon Snow:  Ghost?\nSam, Pyp, and Grenn:  Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!\nDuring the chase, Sam hits his head on a tree branch and falls off his horse. The others and later Jon stop to assist him.\nGrenn:  Samwell!\nPyp:  ls he dead?\nGrenn:  No, he's not dead.\nSamwell Tarly:  Did we get him?\nGrenn:  Come on, help me get him up.\nPyp:  Lucky you've got plenty of padding. (to Jon)  We're taking you back to where you belong.\nJon Snow:  l belong with my brother.\nSamwell Tarly:   But we're your brothers now.\nGrenn:  They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.\nJon Snow:  They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.\nPyp:  Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.\nGrenn:  But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.\nJon Snow:  l have to.\nGrenn:  You can't. You said the words.\nJon Snow:  I don't care about  \nSamwell Tarly:  \"Hear my words and bear witness to my vow\"\nJon Snow:  To hell with all of you.\nPyp:  \"Night gathers and now my watch begins. lt shall not end until my death. l shall live and die at my post.\nGrenn:  \"l am the sword in the darkness   \"\nSam, Pyp, and Grenn:  (in unison, reciting the vow) \"l am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come. \nSam brings Longclaw to Jon, who accepts it.\n------------------------------------------\n\nAcross the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is tending to Drogo and his wounds inside a yurt.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars.\nWe cut to Daenerys standing with her head pressing against Drogo s chest, now visibly more distressed.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  (crying)  When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.\nDaenerys kisses Drogo, then uses a pillow to smother him.\n\n------------------------------------------\nIn King s Landing, Pycelle is having a conversation with someone (unseen at first) in his bedchambers.\n\nGrand Maester Pycelle:  Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is   For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal   powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign.\n\nRos gets dressed while Pycelle keeps talking.\nGrand Maester Pycelle:   He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness.\nRos is listening, but seems really bored by the whole thing.\nRos:  So what's the thing?\nGrand Maester Pycelle:  What thing?\nRos:  About kings. You said, \"The thing you need to understand about kings\".\nGrand Maester Pycelle:  What? Things? What?\nRos:  When you started, you  Never mind.\nGrand Maester Pycelle:  Let me see you out, my dear.\nRos:  lt's all right. No need.\nGrand Maester Pycelle:  Yes, yes. Till the next time. (Pycelle gets off the bed and stretches his limbs with ease, belying his old age and general sickly demeanor) Right.\nHe gets dressed in his robes and looks at himself in the mirror with pride. Before he leaves his chambers, he moves from an upright position to the hunchback he s always seen with in public. He s faking it.\n\nIn the Throne Room, Littlefinger and Varys have a chat overlooking the Iron Throne.\nVarys:  When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?\nPetyr Baelish:  lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.\nVarys:  A man with great ambition and no morals  l wouldn't bet against you.\nPetyr Baelish:  And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?\nVarys:  l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.\nPetyr Baelish:  You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.\nVarys:  Oh, you can do better than that.\nPetyr Baelish:  When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered.\nVarys:  Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?\nPetyr Baelish:  l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?\nVarys:  l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.\nPetyr Baelish:  Must be strange for you, even after all these years  a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all.\nVarys:  Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?\nPetyr Baelish:  But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.\nVarys:  And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men   and women.\nPetyr Baelish:  A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.\nVarys:  So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.\nPetyr Baelish:  Playing our roles.\nVarys:  (Joffrey arrives, Varys bows)  Serving a new King.\nPetyr Baelish:  Long may he reign. My king. (bows)\nVarys:  My king.\nJoffrey Baratheon:  My lords. Shall we begin?\n\nElsewhere in King s Landing, Yoren is taking Arya to safety, away from the city.\nYoren:  You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions,  cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?\nArya Stark:  Arry.\nYoren:  You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time    men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot   half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself   and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.\nArya bumps into a fat recruit, Hot Pie.\nHot Pie:  Watch yourself, midget.\nLommy Greenhands:  He's got a sword, this one.\nHot Pie:  What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?\nLommy Greenhands:  Maybe he's a little squire.\nHot Pie:  He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.\nLommy Greenhands:  Let's have a look. (wrestles Arya to the ground)\nHot Pie:  l could use me a sword like that.\nLommy Greenhands:  Take it off him.\nHot Pie:  Give it here, midget.\nLommy Greenhands:  Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.\nHot Pie:  l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!\nArya Stark:  (pointing Needle at Hot Pie) You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.\nHot Pie bumps into Gendry, Robert s bastard.\nGendry:  Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? (Hot Pie leaves, scared. Gendry talks to Arya alone) This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?\nArya Stark:  lt was a gift.\nGendry:  lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers.\nArya Stark:  Which are you?\nGendry:  Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am.\nYoren:  (shouting) Come on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall, and winter is coming!\n\nThe caravan of the Night s Watch leaves the walls of King s Landing.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nBack at Castle Black, Jon is serving Commander Mormont his breakfast.\nJeor Mormont:  Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?\n(Jon looks at the Lord Commander with surprise) Don't look so terrified. lf we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town. Honor made you leave, honor brought you back.\nJon Snow:  My friends brought me back.\nJeor Mormont:  l didn't say it was your honor.\nJon Snow:  They killed my father.\nJeor Mormont:  And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?\nJon Snow:  No.\nJeor Mormont:  When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?\nJon Snow:  No.\nJeor Mormont:  Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.\nJon Snow:  Beyond the Wall?\nJeor Mormont:  l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?\n\nThe Men of the Night s Watch gather their forces at leave to range Beyond the Wall. Lord Commander Mormont leads them, with Jon amongst his brothers.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAcross the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is leading a ceremony for Drogo after his death.\n\nRakharo:  (picking up the dragon eggs from their chest, speaking in Dothraki) ls this your command, Khaleesi? (Daenerys nods, Rakharo places the eggs next to Drogo s funeral pyre)\nJorah Mormont:  Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  They were not given to me to sell.\nJorah Mormont:  Khaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  l must. You don't understand.\nJorah Mormont:  Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  ls that what you fear? (kisses Jorah on the cheek, then speaks to the rest of the Dothraki and Lhazareen who stayed with her)  You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives.\nMirri Maz Duur is shown tied and bound by rope.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me.\n(to the crowd)  l am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen of the blood of old Valyria. I am the Dragon s daughter. And I swear to you that those who would harm you will die screaming.\nMirri Maz Duur:  You will not hear me scream.\nDaenerys Targaryen:  I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.\n\nDaenerys walks towards the pyre and lights it on fire with a torch. Mirri Maz Duur starts uttering some incantations which quickly turn into screaming. Daenerys walks into the burning pyre as her dress catches fire. The flames engulf everything, and the screen fades to black.\nWe then cut to the next day in the morning. Jorah goes to the pyre to see if there s anything left of it. Amidst the smoke, a naked Daenerys appears, covered in soot and carrying three baby dragons in her arms and back.\nJorah Mormont:  (bowing)  Blood of my blood.\n\nEveryone else bows to her as her dragons start screeching. We cut to black over a final screech from one her dragons.\n\n", "episode_17": "\"From this time until the end of time, we are the free and independent Kingdom of the North.\" You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin? I will, Your Grace. Did you see my brother when you were the Starks' guest? I did. Tell him he's not been forgotten. ( Grunts ) ( Panting ) I'll do it. Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it. Be quick about it. ( Grunts ) ( Sword clangs ) I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. All of you should do as he commands. Betray me and you will wish you hadn't. Man: All hail the king. ( Groans ) ( Crowd murmuring ) Who threw that? ( Crowd shouting ) Get back! ( Whimpering ) You're all right now, little bird. You're all right. Your brothers desert you? We'll stop here. Think they're out looking for you? Yes. ( Grunts ) What might this be? Let's go. Amory Lorch. Now! A man will do what must be done. Guard! I have something for you from Prince Theon. ( Gurgles ) When I came to this city, I had nothing. Today I am the richest man in Qarth with no regrets. Where are they? Where are my dragons?! ( Screeching ) ( Theme music playing ) ? Game of Thrones 2x07 ? A Man Without Honor Original Air Date on May 13, 2012 ? A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you? The giant must have took him. The giant? Hodor? Oh, well, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one? Gone along with the wildling woman, the one you were f*cking. ( Grunting ) ( Man groaning ) ( Panting ) Right, get the horses and the hounds. ( Dogs barking ) Come on, find the scent. Come on, where they going? Halt! Enjoying your first hunt? So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, My Lord. With hunting, there's blood at the end. They're little boys. I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them. Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead. They have no value to me missing. Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now. Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell against 10,000. ( Dogs barking ) Man: We have a scent! The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game. Osha: We should have took more food. We couldn't risk going to the kitchens. Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed. And if Theon found out, he'd hang them. The boy can't survive on walnuts. I'm fine. We've been walking since before sunrise. Even Hodor will tire. Hodor. Even you, sweet giant. ( Chuckles ) Hodor. ( Children shouting ) Wait, I know that farm. I sent those two Winterfell orphans there. Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food. We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are. Billy climbs a tree better than anyone. You've never seen me climb a tree, little man. They'll be after us with hounds. We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever. Did you pull a knife on me in the night? What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's ass. Let's move. Oh, it is the first time. How old are you, boy? I'm a man of the Night's Watch. You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets ... Don't call them that. What, stones? Or bone? Neither. Both. Move! Ygritte: I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows? There are no women of the Night's Watch, no. So the lads just do it with each other? No. Never? Never. We swore an oath. You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable. Would you please shut up? ( Mocking ) Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman ... You're a free woman? I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman. If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what \"prisoner\" means. And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl. It was my choice to say the words. So you don't like girls? Of course I like girls. But you chose never to touch them. That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch. So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands ... Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy! They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours. My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours. So why are you fighting us? Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Guard: Come on, this way. ( Man screaming ) Come on, speak up. Speak up. ( Sniffs ) Wolfsbane ... a rare substance. This is no common assassin. We hanged 20 men last night. I don't care if you hanged 100. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head. Mountain: We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners. Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one. Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence. Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side. Mmm. Is that mutton? Yes, My Lord. Don't like mutton. I'll bring something else. Leave it. Are you hungry? No. Of course you are. Eat. I'll eat in the kitchen later. It's bad manners to refuse a Lord's offer. Sit. Eat. You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life. I eat a lot. I just don't grow. Hmm. This will be my last war, win or lose. Have you ever lost before? Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war? But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The \"War of Five Kings\" they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months. Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built ... the tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had 35 hearths. 35. Can you imagine? Look at it now ... a blasted ruin. Do you know what happened? Dragons? Yes, dragons happened. Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire ... mm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name 300 years after his death. Aegon and his sisters. Mm? It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too. Correct. A student of history, are you? Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar. I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy. Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister. Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it? Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair? Most girls are idiots. Ha! You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian Steel sword? From my father. He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason. Have you met many stonemasons, My Lord? Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want. And, girl. M'lord. Lowborn girls say \"M'lord,\" not \"My Lord.\" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly. My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, My Lord. She taught me how to speak proper ... properly. You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that? Yes. Go on. I beg pardon, Ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave. Brave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats. Does it give you joy to scare people? No. It gives me joy to kill people. Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man. It was his duty. He never liked it. Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is. Why are you always so hateful? You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king. I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did. You are one of the Thirteen. If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own. Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world. Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back. There is no we, so why would you help me get them back? I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof. But it did happen under your roof. Khaleesi, many times in my life I have been ... I don't care where you've been. You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but... We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his ass. We don't go serving some sh1t king who's only king because his father was. No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall. We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night. You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you. Walk. I could teach you how to do it. I know how to do it. You know nothing, Jon Snow. ( Chatter ) And what did she say? She admired your spirit, Your Grace. And what then? She, uh... If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang. She tore the paper in half, Your Grace. You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean. And give him a hot supper. Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace. The prisoners from the Yellow Fork. Too many prisoners. Is there room for Ser Alton? Does he need to lie down? Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them. Torrhen. That will be all. Your Grace. A minute of your time? I've been treating your wounded men. And my enemies as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning. They're not my enemies. That's what I tell my bannermen. I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced ... egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses. But some are not. I need silk for stitching. I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over. If you need help finding these ... I know where to find them. I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you. Continue, My Lady. You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender? Yes. The Crag will have a Maester and he will have what I need. I expect he will. If I could write a list ... come with me to the Crag. I don't think that will be ... Let the Maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well ... all the wounded men. ( Dog barking ) Woman: Children, come inside, quick. Hurry up! ( Dog barking ) Man: Can't find anything, Ser. They've lost the scent. Try again. We've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them. We could start the search fresh in the morning, My Lord. I'm looking at spending the rest of life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, \"Is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening?\" The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little sh1ts... It's better to be cruel than weak. Prince Theon. Where are they? Who, m'lord? The Stark boys. Where are they? I don't know. I seen no one. Oh! Think harder. I swear, m'lord, I don't know. My Lord, over here. I think I've found what we're looking for. Send the old man home. Go back to Winterfell. Take him back. Theon, don't do this. ( Birds chirping ) You came back. As soon as I heard. Do you know anything? Irri is dead. I know. She was a good ... she's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her. Doreah? We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse. I should have been here. You went to find me a ship. My place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people. These people? They are not to be trusted. And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one ... my brother, and he would have let 1,000 men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse. Your people are in Westeros. The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive. They will soon enough. And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool. You are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi. There it is ... \"trust me.\" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it. You are too young to be so ... And you are too familiar. Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how. Find my dragons. Ygritte: How long till we get back to your crows? We're close. What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? Do you even know where they are? We're close. What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me? Nothing happened between you and me. \"I swear it, old master king crow, Ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his ... his ... well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but, oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ... ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?\" Turn back around. \"And I thought that we were done, but he said, ( deep voice ) 'Turn back around.'\" ( normal voice ) I'll tell you what, Jon Snow, since it's going to be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just. What, right here in the muck? I'll keep you warm enough. Are you that afraid of it? That's enough. Oh, it's nice and wet and warm. Enough it don't have teeth. All right! All right. Gods, you're dull. ( Grunting ) ( Sword rings ) ( Ygritte whistles ) Should have took me while you had the chance. ( Sansa crying ) ( Sansa crying ) No, no! ( Screams ) ( Laughs ) ( Screams ) No. Oh, no. ( Whimpering ) It's all right. Give me that. If the queen sees I can have Joffrey's children now... Help me flip it over. Where are you going? To tell her Grace. You'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand? Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more. My mother told me, but I thought it would be different. In what way? I thought it would be less ... less messy. Wait until you bear the child. You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means? I'm fit to bear children for the king? A prospect that once delighted you ... bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen. Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood. His Grace was not with you? Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion. You may never love the king, but you will love his children. I love his Grace with all my heart. That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice. But... shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace? You can try, little dove. ( Chatter ) Who did you say your mother was again? Cinda Lannister. Is she the fat one? Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she ... No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it. I ... I squired for you once, you know? When? The tournament the day of Willem Frey's wedding. I went to Willem Frey's wedding? You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he ... He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name? Bryan. ( Laughs ) Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You had never squired for anyone before. That's right. I ran up and volunteered. \"Let me, My Lord. Let me.\" My father was furious, afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the family. You didn't, though. You really remember? Mm. You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them. Well, when I think back to that day ... ( hisses ) You were saying? I ... never mind. It's embarrassing. More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own sh1t? I remember everything about that day ... your helmet, your horse, the rake line in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about. I understand completely. How could you? S-sorry, I ... I didn't mean to doubt you. It's just that I ... I was 16 once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice. Which knight was it? Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood outlaws. Before your time. What was he like? ( Sighs ) He was a painter, a painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect... I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you. It's hard to put into words. It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember and finding out that the dream is more real than your life. Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison. Did you squire for him again? No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability... until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire. It's a good thing I am who I am. ( Chuckles ) I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark ... I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. But me, though ... my life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint. Have you thought about...? Of course. Every day. And? Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful. But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now. What is it? It's actually quite simple. Well, let me help you. You'll only have to do one thing. Tell me. You'll have to die. ( Crunching ) ( Choking ) ( Bone breaks ) ( Bird screeching ) Jorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the Doom must have protection. I didn't come here for lessons. No, you came for the dragons. You have them? Where are they? Draw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons. You love her. Where are the dragons? Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal? Will you betray her again? Never. The thief you seek is with her now. Spice King: I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief. No one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us? Please, they're my children. I'm begging you. Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us. Without me, the dragons will die. It will be for the best. Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear. If I knew where they were, I would not tell you. Pyat Pree: You are cruel, my friend. The mother of dragons is in the right. She must be reunited with her babies. I will help you, Khaleesi. How? I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them. You have my dragons? When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth. ( Laughter ) He procured them for me. But there is no King of Qarth. Xaro: There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement. You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me. Your ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king. An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise. The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side... forever. A mother should be with her children. Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them. Lady Stark! No farther. Keep your hands off me, woman. Don't enter without an invitation, man. Forgive me. Lady Stark. Catelyn: What is it? They caught the Kingslayer. ( Men shouting ) Kill the f*cking Kingslayer! Hang him! ( Men shouting ) You'll die today. Justice for the Karstark. Gut him! Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death. Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner. This monster killed my son. And crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here. I will have his head. And if you try and stop me ... You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, Ser? I am the widow of your liege Lord Eddark Stark. I am the mother of your king! And where is our king now? You know very well. He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender. Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate. He brought that foreign bitch with him. How dare you? Threatening My Lady is an act of treason. Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters? I understand your grief, My Lord ... better than most I understand it ... but in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down. When your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head. Wise men do not make demands of kings. Fathers who love their sons do. I will have his head. Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but ... Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find! You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you. And gag him! Since when do you light your own candles? Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant. How many times can you read one raven scroll? Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth ... 200 ships. More than we have. Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind. We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above. \"Rain fire on them from above.\" You're quoting father, aren't you? Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he? We call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me, and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm. I'm sure you'll make a point eventually. He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead ... I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse. I thought the girls might help him. Did you? I was wrong. If we can't control him... Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me. It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head. I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him... in a certain light. The boy is more Robert than Jaime. Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder... What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins. Sins? The Targaryens ... Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin. You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them. ( Crying ) Why wait? We're sworn to the king. There's not a king. That's treason. So is saving Lannisters, yeah? Back off, you. No, I won't. Your son returns at dawn, My Lady? So they say. Brienne: The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords... who wants to die defending a Lannister? Come. I need to be alone with him. My Lady, our orders ... your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him. Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman? Do you hear them out there? They want your head. Well, old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me. You strangled his son with your chains. Oh, oh. Was he the one on guard duty? ( Sighs ) He was in my way. Any Knight would have done the same. You are no Knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took. So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast? She is a truer Knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer. Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the second of his name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back. You are a man without honor. Do you know I've never been with any woman but Cersei? So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that b*st*rd so in he fathered? Brienne. No, that wasn't it. Snow, a b*st*rd from the North. Now, when ... when good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddark Stark f*cked another woman. Your sword. I told you what would happen. All of you ... I told you what would happen if you served me loyally... and what would happen if you did not. What are you doing? What have you done? If there's any who still question whether your new lord means what he says... Here is the answer to your question. ( Crowd gasps, murmurs ) No! ( Theme music playing )", "episode_16": "Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore? Dorne is the safest place for her. You cannot stop it. No! No, wait. It wasn't her. You can't avenge him if you're dead. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. It would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying, Mother of Dragons. Stannis will be here in an hour. Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen. Do you want to be a queen? I want to be the queen. There on that mountain. We need to get rid of those lookouts. I need to move fast and silent. Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin. Aye. Are you going to kill Joffrey? If the Gods give me strength. And then what? First we have to win the war. You never told me where you're from. Volantis. You're one of them now. I should have let you burn. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. Speak three names. I can name anyone? And you'll kill him? A man has said. The one who tortures everyone. They call him the Tickler. The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square. More impressive prize than a few fisherman's daughters. Soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. Take me to my ship. Lord Stark, Torrhen's Square is under siege. Torrhen's Square is barely 40 leagues from here. Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need. What did you see in your dream? That the sea came to Winterfell. Drowned men were floating in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them. ( Theme music playing ) ? Game of Thrones 2x06 ? The Old Gods and the New Original Air Date on May 6, 2012 ? I've taken your castle. Theon? It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes. Why? To take the castle. You went with Robb. And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor? I don't know. Find the Halfwit. My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard. Why? So you and I can go down and tell them how you've yielded Winterfell to me. I won't. Yes, you will. I won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out. The castle is mine, but these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say. Theon. Did you hate us the whole time? I've yielded Winterfell to Theon. Louder. Say Prince Theon. I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me. Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of sh1t. Farlen, you be silent. Listen to your little Lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do. All of you should do as he commands. My father has donned the ancient crown of salt and rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects. Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with this ... Shut up! If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here and one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring 500 men to Winterfell. You are a Maester of the Citadel sworn to serve the lord of Winterfell, are you not? I am. I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens. My Lord. My Lord Greyjoy. I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive. You were here the day I was taken. I'm the one who took you. What of it? Let me serve you. Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts. It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again. So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up. Step aside. Why? It's your dream, Little Lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me. And in a few days' time ... Greyjoy! What have they done to him? We caught this one on this way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword. Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes. It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people. They are not my people. King Robb thought of you as a brother. My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you. Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons. Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage taken from my home. If he were alive to see this ... He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine. I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand. You've served this House faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll ... Take him to the cells. Lock him up ... My prince, you cannot let that stand. He must pay. I'll lock him in a cell until he rots ... No, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives. Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death. No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded. The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut. I urge you not to make a hasty decision. He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine. He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do. You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next. Come. No! No! - Theon! Please! Ser Rodrik! He who passes the sentence should swing the sword. - I'm begging you! Coward. Stop! Stop right now! You don't give commands anymore, Little Lord. Please, stop this. Please stop him. Hush now, child. I'm off to see your father. You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please. Any last words, old man? Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost. Theon, please, don't. Do something. I'll do anything. Please! No, please, stop it! Ghost, stay with us. Ghost! There goes your pet. He's not a pet. You're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing. Ghost is different. So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night. I thought you said you couldn't know wild things. I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark. We could do the same. No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it. My father always said I'm of the North. I wasn't joking. Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it'll kill you. You understand me? No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return ... your life. I'll gladly give my life. I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy ... your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name, but they'll be alive because some nameless b*st*rd north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me? I do. You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night, make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us. Can you read? My Lord? Can you read? This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand. My apologies, My Lord. I must have ... Girl, fetch me the \"History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses.\" It's the one on the ... My cupbearer can read better than you. To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance? My Lord, I ... To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have 20,000 men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll... Leave us. Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it. Lord Petyr Baelish. Hmmm. Give us the room. Clear all this. Lord Tywin. Baelish. Wine? Thank you. What news from the capital? I travelled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp. Ah, the late king Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear. So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work, dark forces. Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel. It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after. You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today? After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers. Yes, yes, yes. The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery ... Wants to be queen. Yes, she does. House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne, against my grandson. They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated. More wine for Lord Baelish. If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement ... The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden? They have. Pardon, My Lord. It's only wine. You would ride there yourself? Tonight, with your leave. I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl. What else? On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark. Why? He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters. Hmm. A girl. A wildling. We could question her. You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking. What's your name? Ygritte. She was reaching for this axe when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face. I gave you my name. I'm Jon Snow. You ought to burn them you killed. We'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte, why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area? Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again. Our boy here's already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass? The Free Folk. How many? Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, Crow. Why come to the mountains? What's in the frostfangs your king could want? Do you mean to march on the Wall? Do you know who I am, girl? Qhorin Halfhand. Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner? They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow. We have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it? No. No, I'll do it. Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it. We'll meet you at the top. Don't take too long. We're deep in their country now. You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The Crows would never catch us. I'm as much a Crow as they are. Will you burn me... after? Can't. Someone might see the smoke. Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's cold. Go on. Be quick about it. Do it. b*st*rd, do it! You can't do it. We both know it. The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close. I'll find them. Call for the go on. Call loudly. May the Seven guide the princess on her journey. May the mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage. One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone, before I take her from you. You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don't cry. I saw you cry. Did you say something, My Lady? My little brother cried when I left Winterfell. So? It seems a normal thing. Is your little brother a prince? No. Not really relevant, then, is it? Come, dog. Hail, Joffrey! Hail to the king. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace. Murderer! b*st*rd! All hail the king. He's no king. He's a b*st*rd! Please, Your Grace, we're hungry. Freak! Get the prince back to the keep now. Yes, My Lord. Come, quickly. Please, Your Grace, give us some food! Bread, Your Grace, please! Who threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me! Hold on! Hold them back! Just kill them! Kill them all! Move. Move! - Pull back! Tear him to pieces! What are you doing? I want these people executed! And they want the same for you. Where's Sansa? Through the door! Come on! Protect the king! Get back! Fall back! Move! To the gates! Come in! Come in! Keep him safe! m*therf*cker! Watch out. Hold them back. Come on. Hey! Traitors! I'll have all their heads. Oh, you blind, bloody fool. You can't insult me. We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king. You can't ... I can, I am. They attacked me! They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool. All because of a war you started. You're talking to a king! And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl? Let them have her. If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back. You owe him quite a bit, you know. Where are you going? You ever been f*cked, little girl? Come here. Take some men and go and find the Stark girl. I take my orders from the king. This way! Please! No, no. Please! You're all right now, little bird. You're all right. We'll get you. We'll get you. This way. Are you hurt, My Lady? The little bird's bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage, see to that cut. Well done, Clegane. I didn't do it for you. He shouldn't make me wait. The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth. I already have a husband. Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful. And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery. I have travelled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery. The Mother of Dragons! Ah. Here he comes. Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself. Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself. Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Ahem. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square. Thank you, My Lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want. Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want? My birthright ... the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have. I'm not asking you for the Kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships. I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another. Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne. Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne? My father sat there before he was murdered. But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say take the Iron Throne? I didn't come here to argue grammar. Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army? Not yet. You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros? There are many there that support my claim. When were you there last? I left when I was a baby. So, in truth, you have no allies. The people will rise to fight for their rightful Queen when I return. Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you'll pardon me. Do you know Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met. A shrewd man. For my wedding he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed ... the world believed ... that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons. Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true. I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess. I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of old Valyria and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it. Yes, My Lady, but not with my ships. Who taught you to read? My father, My Lord. Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The Maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The Maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time, but he learned. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he? A stonemason. A stonemason who could read? Hmm. He taught himself. Quite a man. What killed him? Loyalty. You're a sharp little thing, aren't you? Did... Forgive me, My Lord. I shouldn't ask questions. No... But you've already begun. Did you know your father, My Lord? I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old. He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man, a weak man who nearly destroyed our House and name. I'm cold. I'll fetch more wood for the fire, My Lord. Mmm. Where are you going, girl? The armory, My Lord. Why? Lord Tywin sent me. What might this be? Lord Tywin gave it to me. What for? To take to the armory. Why would he do that? Let's go and ask him. Move! Get out of the way! Amory Lorch. A girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done. Now! A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time. But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now. Guard! Your Grace. Your Grace. My honor, Your Grace. Your Grace. Your Grace. Quent. Lady Talisa. Your Grace. I'm not sure I'm a lady. Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me. It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows. Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth? Because it's obvious. What if I told you my father sold lace on the long bridge and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop? I'd call you a liar. Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty. I always thought I was a brilliant liar. Better at amputations, I'm afraid. Quite a pretty spot. Will we be here long? I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you. I'm not a spy. Of course a spy would deny being a spy. You're right. You've found me out. I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters. \"The young wolf is on the move.\" Perhaps you'd join me... If you've got time, of course, for, well... Robb. Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very... helpful. Lady Talisa. Lady Stark. Lady Talisa...? Maegyr. Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name. An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, My Lady. Your Grace. I've missed you. Yes, you look positively forlorn. You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today. I wish that you were free to follow your heart. I know. You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. I know. You are promised to another ... a debt that must be paid. I haven't forgotten. Your Grace. My Lady. News from Winterfell. Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go. We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today. Here? There's no shelter here. There's no shelter anywhere. There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire ... No fire. But a fire is ... No fire. Have it your way. We'll stay warmer if we stay close. Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life. Think they're out looking for you? Yes. Think they'll find you? Yes. You're brave. Stupid, but brave. We start again at first light. Get some sleep. Stop moving. I'm just trying to get comfortable. Stop it! You're still moving. Was I? I didn't notice that time. This cannot be true. We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true. Why? Why would Theon ... Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores. My brothers? We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead. I told you, never trust a Greyjoy! I must go North at once. There's still a war to win, Your Grace. How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't ... You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself. Let me go and talk to Theon. There will be no talk. He will die for this. Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my b*st*rd at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head. Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon ... I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself. Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you? I'm no liar. All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone. I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, My Lord. How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand. There are other ways to serve, My Lord. I'm a prince now, and you'd do well ... There are other ways to serve, my prince. Like what? We know things, the Free people. You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt? Other things. Savage things. Wait outside. I always wondered what you had under there. It comes at a price. I'm not killing you. That's your price. I already had that. What do you want, then, other than your miserable life? What all free people want ... my freedom. Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well. Ow. Shh. It's not deep. I thought they were going to kill me. They thought so, too. He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me. Of course he did. Why? Why would a stranger ... you are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead. I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the King more than any of them. Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you ... But you're not the wrong people. Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way. And where are you going? I have something for you from Prince Theon. What? Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm. The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat? When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets. Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi. Where are they? Where are my dragons?!", "episode_15": "The wolf pup has gone south. The North is ripe for the taking. You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stony Shore I'm to fight fishermen? Be careful of their nets. Lovely boy. What do you want? You're called Arry? A boy could make a friend. This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Every night it's the same. I'm running through the Godswood howling. These are dreams, nothing more. My dreams are different. Mine are true. I saw something take that child. Wildlings serve crueler Gods than you or I. Ready my horse. We leave at dawn. Did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? Nothing to say? Mercy! Mercy, My Lord! I want to know what Cersei is doing and you will tell me. Yes, My Lord, I will. Sweet boy! Help us! Round up any survivors. We'll take them back to Harrenhal. This one's a girl dressed as a boy. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer. I will give you this one night to reconsider. Otherwise I shall destroy you. Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors. I will vouch for her, her people and her dragons. Be it on your head. Welcome to Qarth, My Lady. Trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks. What am I bringing ashore? The red woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again. ? Game of Thrones 2x05 ? The Ghost of Harrenhal Original Air Date on April 29, 2012 ? You swear it? By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne. Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North, the Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty. And the wording of this oath? The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together. And in return for my son's loyalty? In the morning I'll destroy my brother's army. When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before. Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother. Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind. Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight. No! No. Follow me! You'll die for this. No, wait, it wasn't her! You'll-. No, wa- We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this. - Inside the King's tent, go! Now! I won't leave him. You can't avenge him if you're dead. Over there, go! Not that way. We need to go home. Loras. My Lord, My Lady. Get out. Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king. And you want that privilege for yourself. You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis. There's no time for this. Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis. Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly. I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death? Stannis. I will put a sword through his righteous face. You can't stay here. He would have been a true king, a good king. Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world? Revenge. I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it. You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please. He was very handsome. He was, Your Grace. \"Your Grace.\" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen. Do you want to be a queen? No. I want to be the queen. Killed? By whom? Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way. Really? Who'd have thought? Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour. Whomever did it, I say well done. It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea. Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one. And I say father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later. Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away? She'll be safer in Dorne. Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety. It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you. So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots? Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready. No need to concern yourself over it. The King is taking personal charge of siege preparations. May I ask specifically what the King has in mind? You may specifically or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same. It's important that we talk about this. It's the King's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors. It's wildfire. Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin? No. That's a lie right there. It is not a lie. Why would I lie? Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're f*cking her, I mean. I'm telling you the truth. The smart money would be on more likely. She's making wildfire. But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours. The alchemists' guild is being commissioned. I suppose there's only one way to find out. They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch them from the city walls into Stannis's ships and armies. Please. When did she tell you this? I heard her talking with the Pyromancer. And the other night after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you. Swear to me on what? On my life. But I don't care about your life. In the Light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow ... All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out. Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me. Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion. It will be my pleasure. Your Grace. What is it? Your Grace. I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace. I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him. Your Grace. Fools love a fool. Your Grace. I grieve for him as well ... for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be. I need to speak to you about what I saw in that cave. I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter. Your Grace, I ... I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice. And I've never known you to hide from the truth. You've come to lecture me on truth? I've come to tell you that what I saw ... All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne. Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron ... I'll hear no more about it. Take a company of men, secure the perimeter. When do we sail for King's Landing? As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city. And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you? That's not your concern. If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers. I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong? Loyal service means telling hard truths. Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth? She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey. What do you believe? You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her. We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay. Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy. Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos. I've got it! I've got it! So it's that one there at the top, on the right. Buy my fruit, My Lord. Fresh fruit. Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have? There's that mind of yours you keep going on about. Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it. Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father? He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it. Corruption, yes. We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of Kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king. It's hard to argue with his assessment. Not after what he did to your birthday present. The King is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now. A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey. You have to admire his imagination. He's talking about you. What? Demon monkey? People think you're pulling the King's strings. They blame you for the city's ills. Blame me? I'm trying to save them. You don't need to convince me. Demon monkey. ( Seagulls screeching Yeah, come on. You're the crew of the sea bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome. Stop. Stop! Your Captain commands you to stop. Where are we heading, Captain? The Stony Shore to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well. And who decides if we've done our jobs well? I do. Your Captain. I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you? You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains, and hang you for a traitor. Stop. We yield. Congratulations on your first command. Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off. Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got 30 ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow. You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want them to set sail without you. That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore. Come on, I'll take you out. Who are you? Dagmer, your first mate. Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh. They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself. And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages? You're not. And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander. They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like? The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square. The seat of the House of Tallhart ... a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it? No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then ... take me to my ship. The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed. The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them. Our spies report growing discontent among the northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn. And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the southern lords. This is war; No one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him? We've worked through the night, My Lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep. As I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you. My wife's in Lannisport. Well, then you'd better start riding. Go before I change my mind and send her your head. If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go! Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl. Where are you from? Maidenpool, My Lord. And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me. House Mooton, My Lord. And what is their Sigil? A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a northerner, aren't you? Good. One more time, where are you from? Barrowton, My Lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown. And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North? They call him the young wolf. And? They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant Direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed. And do you believe them? No, My Lord. Anyone can be killed. Fetch that water. A girl says nothing. A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl. I was always a girl. And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them. You're one of them now. I should have let you burn. And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me? I didn't have a choice. You did. I did. And here we are. A man pays his debts. A man owes three. Three what? The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you ... no more, no less, and we're done. I can name anyone and you'll kill him? A man has said. The one who tortures everyone. A man needs a name. I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler. That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty. He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn. When will he come? The Halfhand does things in his own time. My uncle told me stories about him. Most of them are true. I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the wall. The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw. So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own. Well, possible for the Halfhand. Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here. There's nothing more sickening than a man in love. About time you did something. At least you'll keep warm. The fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is ... before the Targaryens defeated the Hendals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men. Before I die, please, stop talking. Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men? Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this. I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked. Wildlings? One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts. So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes. And three for White Walkers. It's been 1,000 years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times. But if it's been 1,000 years, how do you know? Well... I read it in a book. Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand. Aye, we'll live another day. Hurrah. Take care, My Lord. I remember reading an old sailor's proverb ... \"piss on wildfire and your cock burns off.\" Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow. After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power. My companion takes issue. If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig sh1t... No offense meant. Our order does not deal in pig sh1t. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor. To do what? The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy. How much do you have? If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in 10, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father. My Lord, this man is insulting. I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men sh1t themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor c**ts trying to defend the city end up burning it down. My friend remains unconvinced. He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived. Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks. We have been working tirelessly day and night ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811, enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both. This is a sh1t idea. I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, wisdom Hallyne. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me. Dracarys. Dracarys. He'll be able to feed himself from now on. Let him sleep, Doreah. Yes, Khaleesi. He loves you. Thank you, my friend. Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth. It is known. And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos ... The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo. Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy. You would look like a real princess in Xaro's ... She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi. You are their guest. It would be rude not to. And you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen. It sounds wonderful. The Meereens think they have a night market. I will take you there myself. Please excuse me for a moment. What are they doing? Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry. My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built. It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men. That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be. Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration? Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once. Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You're always welcome, Mother of Dragons. My apologies. Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth. What is the House of the Undying? It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft ... so soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic. You watch over her. Do I know you? I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. Who are you? I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power. It looked like Stannis. To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man. In the shape of Stannis. We should reach my son's camp tomorrow. Will you stay there long, My Lady? Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long. I never knew my mother. I'm sorry. My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young. It's a bloody business. What comes after is even harder. Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, My Lady? You mean to kill Stannis. I swore a vow. But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe. I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled. Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely. I only held him that once as he was dying. He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well. I do not know your son, My Lady... but I could serve you if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis. When the time comes, I will not hold you back. Then I am yours, My Lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new. I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new. And it's not just thieves, My Lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I've ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, My Lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night. We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board. My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, My Lord. And may the Gods bless you and yours. Stop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark. Good. Hodor. Hodor. Bran ... Lord Stark. Torrhen's Square is under siege. Torrhen's Square is barely 40 leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north? Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain. Might be Sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister. We have to help them. Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather 200 decent men. Do you need so many? If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need. Won't take long, My Lord. Southerners don't do well up here. So, what does it mean? Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time. I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven. Must not mean anything, then You're lying. You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar. You know what it means. I never said I didn't. You didn't give me an honest answer. That's not the same as being a liar. Well, it's not far off. So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the Godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream? Something bad? Tell me, boy. I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls... flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them. The sea is hundreds of miles away. I know. It's just a stupid dream. I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again. Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the wall? They say all sorts of crazy things north of the wall. There. Where? On that Mountain. I don't see very well. A fire. There's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time. to throw a party in our honor. How many wildlings have joined him? From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move. Where? Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us. You saying we should fall back to the Wall? Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's gonna teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force. And they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that... We need to get rid of those lookouts. It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba. Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin. I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger. I've fought and killed a Wight. How many rangers can say that? He's the one? Aye. You killed a Wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword. Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat. I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, My Lord. It would be no trouble. Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward. Go on. So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you? He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor, my friend. Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants. And what about what a woman wants? Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want? To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne. Why? Because I promised my Khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home. You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms? I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it. Ah, a conqueror. And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you? No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo. So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. you're just less ambitious. Mmm. What do you want, Xaro Zhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why? I will show you why. The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key. And behind the door? And it can all be mine? All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies ... enough to go home. All I have to do? Is marry me. That was a romantic proposal. I've already married once for love, but the Gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be Princes and Princesses. See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, first of your name. Robert Baratheon is dead. If you cross the sea with an army you bought ... The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country. To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros. The usurper is dead. The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other. According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand? The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world. Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way. And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now. I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you must ... Do not speak to me like I'm a child. I only want ... What do you want? Tell me. To see you on the Iron Throne. Why? You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and still can't believe you're real. So what would you have me do as my advisor? Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth. And how do I get the ship? I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain. I look forward to meeting him. Khaleesi. You should stand sideface. Sideface? Sideways. Why? Smaller target. Am I fighting someone? You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right. Guards! Help. Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from. Go up the back. That is strange. Move away. Stand back. He's dead.", "episode_14": "Does it ever end? This is further east than I've ever been. ( Dany speaking Dothraki ) May I present my wife Margaery of House Tyrell? You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself. My son is fighting a war, not playing at one. I cannot defeat my brother in the field. You must give yourself to the Lord of Light. I've said the words, damn you. ( Whispers ) I will give you a son. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She can't know about you. Who are you? I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden. I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. Catelyn: You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne. I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. ( Flies buzz ) You told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne. Never! Throw him in one of the black cells. Cersei: Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore? It's done, Cersei. No. You cannot stop it. No! Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. I'm sorry. Do you want my brother to come in and help? I don't know what you're talking about. There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them. My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade. Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again? Man: Outside! Jaqen: Come here, boy! Sweet boy, help us. Give it to me. ( Blades ring ) ( Groans ) ( Hilt thuds, Arya grunts ) Amory: Round up any survivors. We'll take them back to Harrenhal. We're looking for a b*st*rd named Gendry. You want Gendry? You already got him. ( Theme music playing ) ? Game of Thrones 2x04 ? Garden of Bones Original Air Date on April 22, 2012 ? ( Thunder rumbling ) ( Horse neighs ) It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. He's the strongest. Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight. If the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime. If he ever gets out. ( Thunderclap ) Loras Tyrell? Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the queen. I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them. How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead. ( Laughs ) ( Horse whinnies ) The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses. They get spooked by their own shadows. Shh. ( Horse snorting ) Do you hear that? No. There's something out there. ( Neighing ) ( Farts ) ( Gasps ) ( Laughing ) Oh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face. I swear you pissed yourself. \"Oh, who goes there? Ahh!\" ( Laughs ) There is something out there. Yeah, don't even try me. ( Horse neighs ) Rennick. Do you think I'm an idiot? Rennick! ( Screams ) ( Rennick screaming ) ( Horses neighing ) Man: King in the North! Men: The King in the North! ( Water running ) ( Man groans ) ( Flies buzzing ) ( Man #2 screaming ) ( Horse neighing ) ( Man #3 shouting ) Bolton: Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. Bolton: We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own. We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton. Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans. I doubt it. Bolton: Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family we say, \"A naked man has few secrets. A flayed man none.\" My father outlawed flaying in the North. We're not in the North. We're not torturing them. The high road's very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it. The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters. Man: No, no, don't! Don't! Woman: Shh, shh. Please! Shh. ( Flies buzzing ) The rot's set in. No, don't! No, don't! Shh. Please, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt. The rot will spread. If we don't take the foot now ... No, you can't! Ser! Please, Ser. I can't lose ... You'll die if she does it. I don't want to be a cripple, please. Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub. Your men are not my men, My Lord. Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch. No! You can't! Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me. ( Muffled screaming ) ( Sawing ) What's your name? Talisa. Your last name? You want to know what side my family fights on? You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage. That boy lost his foot on your orders. They killed my father. That boy did? The family he fights for. Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago. I have no hatred for the lad. ( Sighs ) That should help his foot grow back. You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey. You're going to kill Joffrey? If the Gods give me strength. And then what? I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne. So who will? I don't know. You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after? First we have to win the war. You never told me where you're from. Volantis. Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here. He was unlucky that you were. You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons. Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you ... Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage. Lancel: Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. ( Crowd murmuring ) Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain. ( Crowd gasping, murmuring ) Killing you would send your brother a message. ( Crying ) But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn. Leave her face. I like her pretty. ( Blow lands ) ( Sansa gasps ) ( Groans ) Meryn, My Lady is overdressed. Unburden her. If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder. ( Sobbing ) Tyrion: What is the meaning of this? What kind of knight beats a helpless girl? The kind who serves his king, Imp. Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak. Tyrion: Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor? Joffrey: I'm punishing her. Tyrion: For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit. You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes! The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him? No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard. I'm not threatening the King, Ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference? ( Crowd whispering ) Tyrion: I apologize for my nephew's behavior. ( Crowd murmuring ) Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement? I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love. Lady Stark, you may survive us yet. The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains. You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him? There's no cure for being a c**t. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out. What are you doing here, dog? Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it. And? What is it? Look inside, Your Grace. Your Grace. Happy nameday, Your Grace. My nameday has passed. We won't tell if you won't. No. Her. Touch her. ( Women giggle ) ( Breathing heavily ) Could you hit her? ( Laughs ) My uncle sent you? Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself. Hmm. ( Slapping ) ( Laughing ) Use this. Harder. ( Whimpers ) I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth. ( Crying ) ( Screaming ) ( Whimpering, crying ) Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure. ( Woman whimpering ) Please, please, please, Your Grace. Your Grace, if your uncle finds out ... Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done. Or the same thing will happen to you. Begin. ( Thuds ) ( Screams ) Harder! ( Horse whinnies ) Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long. Your Grace. Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron? I'm a practical man. Just not a loyal one. And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse? ( Chuckles ) I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here? Renly: You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge. You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim. Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head. I would give priority to my head. I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or... open gates. Your Grace. Lord Baelish. All of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind ... It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again. Your tent? Not our tent? The King snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne. I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers. If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. But I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent the just now. The place of a Kingsguard is by the King's side. And on the night of the your wedding, who was by the King's side then? You seem quite interested in our marriage. Your marriage is quite interesting... Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else. You've never married, have you? I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly. That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my King, and my King is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night. ( Hoofbeats ) ( Horse whinnies ) ( Speaking Dothraki ) What do you know of this place? Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Nes. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows. ( Man coughing ) ( Man #2 groans ) Man #3: Go on! Man #4: You, keep moving! ( Woman crying ) ( Screams ) Man: Bring her about! What kind of fire melts stone? Dragon fire. There's dragons here? No, all the dragons are dead. What's that smell? Dead people. Move. Man: Please, please, no, no! ( Screaming ) ( Screaming ) ( Sobbing ) No. ( Screaming ) ( Screaming stops ) ( Chains rattle ) ( Heavy thud ) Woman: He's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that. They take someone every day? Does anyone live? ( Thunder rumbling ) Arya: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. The Hound. How dare you? You may have heard false reports. You betrayed Ned. Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment. I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery. No, My Lady. Get out! Cat, I've ... I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance ... Have you lost your mind? Get out! Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever. And Arya, just as wild as ever. You have Arya, too? Both girls are healthy and safe... for now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital. ( Knife clinks ) What do you want? The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer. Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms. I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you. You think I'd keep secrets from my son? Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift. I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith. Good faith? What's this? Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe ... Get out. ( Groans ) ( Men shouting ) Man: Get up, you dogs! ( Wood banging ) That's him, the one who picks. The Mountain. What are you doing? He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked. You. Man: Move, boy! Move! ( Liquid trickling ) Tickler: Is there gold and silver in the village? I don't know. Gems? I didn't see any. Where is the Brotherhood? I don't know. ( Rats squeaking ) ( Squeaking ) Tickler: Where is the Brotherhood? I don't know. Please. Where is the Brotherhood? I don't know. ( Rat squeaking ) ( Whimpering ) Which of the villagers aided them? I don't know. Who? I ... Who? I never saw. Who? I never saw. Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to ... Who? I didn't see anyone help him. ( Rat shrieking ) Take it off! Take it off! Who helped him? Ganes the butcher and his son. That's better. You've been very helpful. No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop! No! No! I told you everything! No! No! ( Screaming ) ( Rat clattering ) Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. The Hound. Woman: Please, Polliver. Some food. Just a crust of bread. ( Woman crying ) Polliver. The Mountain. Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands. I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis. Can that truly be you? Who else might it be? When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that? My own. I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire? The King has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light. Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age. Watch yourself, Renly. Renly: No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you're a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man. You should kneel he's the Lord's chosen, born amidst salt and smoke. Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham? Stannis: That's twice I've warned you. Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers. It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me. We share a common enemy. The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes. The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their King. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power. For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you. Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners? You think a few bolts of cloth will make you King? No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me King. We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see. Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors. Would you believe I loved him once? I thought we were welcome. If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi. Horde? My name is Daenerys ... Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen. You know me, My Lord? Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons. And what should I call you? Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be. The beauty of Quarth is legendary ... Qarth. Qarth. Might we see the dragons? My friend, we have travelled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored ... Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves. I am not a liar. Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value. Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates. Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well. What are you doing? You promised to receive me. We have received you. Here we are, and here you are. If you do not let us in, all of us will die. Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates. Khaleesi, please be careful. Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first. Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be. The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken. I am one of the Thirteen and I am still speaking. The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons. Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands. Our decision is final. Very well. I invoke Soumai. I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons in accordance with the law. Be it on your head. Welcome to Qarth, My Lady. Mountain: You. Tickler: Is there gold or silver in the village? I'm not from the village. Where is the Brotherhood? I don't know what that is. ( Squeaking ) ( Horses neigh ) Man: You two, take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters. What's this? We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin. ( Chuckles ) Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells? Mountain: Cells are overflowing, My Lord. Polliver: This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just... Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers? You, do you have a trade? Gendry: Smith, My Lord. What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy. He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why? Safer to travel, My Lord. Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer. Mountain: My Lord. ( Knocking on door ) Your visits are too few, cousin. Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. Here's your warrant. So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep. I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp. If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that? I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately. And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei? As I said several times. And you've waited this long to deliver the information? When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay. Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf. The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn. She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn. Ah, lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl. I am a knight! An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, Ser? You will withdraw these filthy accusations. Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother? It's not my fault! Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight? Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything. Did he tell you to f*ck her, too? I only meant I did as I was bid. Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this. Mercy! Mercy, My Lord! I beg you. Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel. My Lord, it was your sister's bidding ... the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear. No, I think not. My Lord? You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of ... everything. And you will tell me. Yes, My Lord, I will. I swear it, as you command. Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman. And it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that henceforth I shall do nothing without her consent. But her demands. Oh, I'll give her Pycelle. You will? Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet if she wants, but I will not have him on the council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. ( Wood creaking ) ( Waves crashing ) Man: Stay within one table length. Your Grace. Do your knucklebones bring you luck? Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean. Fewer. Pardon? Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them. It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver. You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good. A lesson I've tried to teach my son. Does he listen? To me? Gods, no. But if your red woman told him to leap from the crow's nest ... She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks. I've lived within the law for 17 ... I want you to be a smuggler this time. Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore? The red woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again. I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways. Cleaner ways don't win wars. Are you afraid, onion knight? Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors. You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth? I'd say my parts are mixed, My Lady ... good and bad. If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil. And which are you? Oh, good. I'm a knight myself of sorts, a champion of light and life. Well, that must be very nice for you. Do you love your wife? I do. Yet you have known other women. Don't talk about my wife. I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe. And you will. Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows. Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are. These weren't here before. They've barred the passage. ( Chuckles ) They can't bar our passage. Gods protect us. There's only one God, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him.

Sam: The Nightfort's closest to Castle Black. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort. Stop. But your father-- I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to. What if I never want you to? And so my watch begins. He's a crow. He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets. Kill him. ( grunts ) The wolves are out there. You're a warg, Bran. Do it. I'm going beyond the Wall. It won't be safe for Rickon. I'm coming with you. You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth. She's just going to kill him. Sacrifice him. The boy's your nephew. The usurper Robb Stark... She says there's power in king's blood. Got salt pork for the feast. The feast is over. Robb! Mother.

The King in the North! ( horse neighs ) The King in the North! The King in the North! Man: Here comes the King in the North! ( knights chanting ) Here comes the King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! Here comes... ( all cheering ) ( men chuckle ) Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. What are you doing? I have a list. A list of people you mean to kill? For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand... You should learn to ignore them. My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp. You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark. The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other. ( chuckles ) So how should we punish them? Who? Whom? Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert. I hear that you're a pervert. I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain. ( chuckles ) We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from. Lady Sansa! My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me. Why sheep shift? That's the vulgar word for dung. My lady... Well, you asked me. Women: Oh! ( giggle ) That's him! My lord, my lady. Your father has called a meeting of the small council. ( door closes ) Killed a few puppies today? Show him. Come on, show him. Oh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers. \"Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.\" Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something? Robb Stark is dead. ( laughing ) And his bitch mother. Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast. Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage. A joke. Joffrey did not mean it. Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast. Tyrion: No. She is no longer yours to torment. Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster. Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies. I could have your tongue out for saying that. Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man. Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste. I am the king! I will punish you. Any man who must say, \"I am the king\" is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you. My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock! The king is tired. See him to his chambers. Come along. I'm not tired. We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest. Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep. I'm not tired! Come. Not you. You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper. You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros. A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king. You really think a crown gives you power? No. I think armies give you power. Mm-hmm. Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same. Mm-hmm. Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances. Which he got from me. Do you disapprove? I'm all for cheating. This is war. But to slaughter them at a wedding... Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10,000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner. So that's why you did it? To save lives? To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood. The northerners will never forget. Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age. I believe you still have some work to do on that score. Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother? One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant. I will not rape her. Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works? Use small words. I'm not as bright as you. The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires. Does that amuse you? No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions. Easy for me, is it? When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family? The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister. Sansa. It's empty. Let's find a place to sleep. ( wind howling ) ( echoing ) Hodor. Hodor. Don't, Hodor. Maybe we shouldn't stay. You'd rather be out there? There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories. I always quite liked the horrible stories. So did I. Once. You ever heard about the Rat Cook? No. Who's he? Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry. ( chuckles ) If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-- It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. ( distant clatter ) That's something the gods can't forgive. ( rats squeaking ) \"The late Walder Frey,\" old Tully called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and I'm Lord of Riverrun. ( laughs ) The Blackfish escaped. An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have? As you say. They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch? You'll be needing a new young girl. Yeah. Got that to look forward to. And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country. He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant... Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity? ( chuckling ) Well, here's to the Young Wolf! ( howls ) Forever young. ( laughs ) Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over? At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins. Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing. I sent my b*st*rd Ramsay to root him out. Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon. Oh. And? Ramsay delivered the terms. The ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay-- well... Ramsay has his own way of doing things. Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock. What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage? People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered... do eunuchs have a phantom cock? Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch? Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples. But my father taught me to aim for their head. ( quietly ) Kill me. Sorry, what? Kill me. A little louder. ( sobbing ) Kill me! You're no good to me dead. We need you. You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat. ( groans ) Stinking meat. ( sniffs ) You reek. ( gasps ) Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name? Theon Greyjoy. What's your name? Th-- Theon Greyjoy. ( groans ) Please. What is your name?! Reek. My name is... Reek. ( wind howling ) ( distant gasp ) ( gasps ) Hodor. ( gasping continues ) ( growling ) ( scraping, footsteps approaching ) ( groaning ) ( shatters ) ( gasps ) ( shouting ) ( panting ) Don't kill me! Who are you? Sam! Sam! Who are you?! Gilly. Don't hurt us. Where are you going? To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. My brother, he's in the Night's-- Shush. Who's your brother? Doesn't matter. ( Summer growling ) You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window. No, I'm not. I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor. Hodor. I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will. Take us north of the Wall. What? Why in the world would you want to go-- I don't want to. I have to. How did you get through the Wall? Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here? Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black. Come with us. There's nothing north but death. Sam: If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you. There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that. What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way. You saw the white walkers and the army of the dead. How do you know all that? The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them. ( baby fussing ) But you're going to stop them? Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to. ( seabirds screeching ) ( distant waves crashing ) \"Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home. On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him. Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.\" Get that out of my sight. Theon disobeyed my orders. The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me. He's your son. Son? He's not a man anymore. He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy. Watch yourself. I've made my decision. And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet. I'm going to choose the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands. Man: Get those ropes! Yara: I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home. What is it? Dragonglass. We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them. Why? What are they for? Killing white walkers. How do you know that? Gilly: The walker came for my baby. And Sam... But no one's killed a white walker in thousands of years. Well, I suppose someone had to be the first. Take it, Hodor. And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us. I wish I could. I really do. How are you keeping? Great. Never better. It was just a bit of blood. I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want. I'm not a highborn. She called you Ser. I heard it. A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you. Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help. I lived below the Street of Flour. How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you? The sh1t that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley. Gin Alley. The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king. Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me. If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her? You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you-- big words, no clothes. What would you have done? She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that. ( both chuckle ) So how'd you become a lord? Oh, that's a long story. Better not, then. I'm a bit busy. Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this. You see? Highborns. I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept. Why did you? I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of sh1t every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life. Does he? He's dead. How'd he die? Following me. ( seabirds screeching ) ( bells dinging ) When did you come to this strange country? When I was 13. You were only a child. I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that. You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking. And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot. She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault. I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me? No, I expect not. She's young and she's beautiful and highborn. We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-- I have a name. You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters. What do you want from me, Lord Varys? Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up. Why do you want me to leave? Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you-- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here... while there's still time. Lord Varys. If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself. Keep up. I don't think I can, my lord. It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy. ( footsteps approaching ) Leave. So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend. She doesn't deserve this. Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world. There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher. ( chuckles ) Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit? I won't be marrying Ser Loras. I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage. You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child. So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it? So she can have some happiness in her life. You have children. How happy would you say you are? Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive. Even Joffrey? Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. \"We should have known. Even then we should have known.\" It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey-- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own. How long does it go on? Until we've dealt with all our enemies. Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more. Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time. ( man laughing ) ( man #2 wailing ) ( both laughing ) I'm telling you, that's what she did. ( wailing ) ( soldiers laughing ) Sounded like a cow in heat. Aye, not for long. That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal. I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body. You sewed it on? I did. I bet there were 1,000 men claiming they were the one. It was me. And Malcolm and Talbott. Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time. Took the skin right with it. What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone. Give it a nice firm mooring and-- What do you want? Mind if I keep warm? f*ck off. But I'm hungry. Does f*ck off mean something different where you're from? I've got money. What kind of coin is that? It's worth a lot. Sorry. Little sh1t. ( grunting ) Man: Fool! Where did you get the knife? From you. Hound: Is that the first man you've killed? The first man. Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first. ( whispers ) Valar morghulis. ( winces ) ( wings flap ) ( horse neighs ) Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am. I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me. You know nothing, Jon Snow. I do know some things. I know I love you. I know you love me. But I have to go home now. ( grunts ) ( groans ) I know how this must look. What I meant was-- I swear to you, my lord-- I'm not a lord, my dear. Not for many, many years. Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles. Among other things. What is your name? Gilly. Ah, for the gillyflower. Lovely. Yes, my-- Maester. Master. Maester. And the child? She hasn't chosen a name yet. His name is Sam. Tarly... do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order? He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build 500 miles of ice walls, 700 feet high to keep out men. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us. Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being. We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall. Thank you... Maester. I can cook and clean and I can-- Good. Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell. I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay. ( chuckles ) Miles better. We had 44 ravens at last count. Make sure they're all fed. Every one of them flies tonight. \"To His Grace King Stannis Baratheon. Invaded-- inv-- invit-- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit--\" Night. \"First night of the full moon.\" Why is there a G in night? I don't know. There just is. Well, your father's not going to go to that. My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday. I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life. \"His fangs were as long as b*st*rd swords.\" Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. \"To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.\" Noblemen. \"Noblemen of Westeros, the Nig-- the Night's Watch... implores...\" What is it? ( bell tolling ) Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked? Stay here. Bar the door. The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman. And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire? I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded. Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man. Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos? Aegon Targaryen. And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros? On the back of his dragon Balerion the Dread. He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal. You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-- And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice. His name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew. What is the life of one b*st*rd boy against a kingdom? Everything. The boy must die. What are you doing? You're leaving. Is this some kind of trick? Yes, but not on you. Aim for that star. Don't stop. There's bread and water. Go slow with it. If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater. I know not to drink seawater. Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you. Where should I go? You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing. The gold cloaks are looking for me. They were looking for me for 20 years. Do they know your face? No. I'd worry more about the Red Woman. The other way. You ever been in a boat before? No. You know how to swim? No. Don't fall out. Go on. Why are you doing this? Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner. When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me. Guard: Horse approaching! Halt! Halt! Jon! Jon! Jon, it's us. I don't think he can see us. Pyp? Sam? Hush, now. You're home. Carry him inside. Gently. ( vendors shouting ) ( chickens clucking ) Out of the way. Step aside, country boy. People working here. Cersei. You don't deny it? No. I let him go. Your mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that? Aye, I do. Melisandre: You saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed? There has got to be another way. What other way?! Tell us about this other way. I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire. Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die. I understand. But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it. You're gonna need me. Take him away. Why am I gonna need you? My king. Davos: It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch. Their Lord Commander is dead. Took a ranging party north and never made it back. One lad did, though. What he saw beyond the Wall-- it's coming for all of us. When did you learn to read? Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you. This War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him. You can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side. I've made my decision. He's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come. ( chuckling ) You see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now. ( dragons chirping ) They will come, Your Grace. When they're ready. Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered. You didn't conquer them. You liberated them. People learn to love their chains. ( dragon screeches ) No. Mhysa! Mhysa! ( all shouting ) Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! What does it mean? It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi. It means \"mother.\" ( shouting continues ) ( dragons screech ) It's all right. These people won't hurt me. Mhysa! Mhysa! ( dragon screeches ) ( screeching ) ( shouting continues ) All: Mhysa. ( chanting ) Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! ( chanting continues ) ( dragons screech )", "episode_19": "The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel. And, of course, flesh. If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen making grand claims about jars full of pig sh1t. Our order does not deal in pig sh1t. King Stannis is my God. He raised me up and gave you a future I could never have imagined. And you think a Fire God commanded all that? It was Stannis. Stannis is my king, but he's only a man. Don't tell him that. Does it give you joy to scare people? No, it gives me joy to kill people. Killing's the sweetest thing there is. You shipped off my only daughter and now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Stannis two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep. Scouts assure us Robb Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force. He'll risk anything at any time. We'll ride at nightfall. The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike. My dear nephew, you do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way? They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile. If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day. Will it hold? Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace. Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest. Mud gate. That's where he'll land. And if Stannis does attack the mud gate, what do we have? ( Theme music playing ) ? Game of Thrones 2x09 ? Blackwater Original Air Date on May 27, 2012 ? Man: That's it. ( Men coughing ) ( Thunder rumbling ) The tide's against us. Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gate. You're coming home. King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years. I spent most of my life dodging the Royal Fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them. This is the Royal Fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain. Of course there are several Royal Fleets at the moment. Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand. Gods be good. God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us. But not over them? Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false King Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike. Well, first we have to put it there. Our ships outnumber theirs 10 to one. Our army outnumber theirs five to one. Those walls have never been breached. And the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator. They see a stranger come to set their city on fire. I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain. ( Thunder crashes ) Are you afraid, my lion? If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid. I won't let them hurt you. I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war. It is now. You can't f*ck your way out of everything. I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth. Pycelle: As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a Maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war. Your words are always wise and measured. If you could ... If anything, a Maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of king ... You brought me something? Yes. Essence of Nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. 10 drops, however ... I know what 10 drops will bring. Your Grace, if I may ask ... You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon. Yes. A siege is very ... Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many. ( Sighs ) Your Grace. ( Men singing ) ? and so he spoke ? ? that Lord of Castamere ? ? but now the rains ? ? weep o'er his halls ? ? with no one there to hear ? ? yes, now the rains ? ? weep o'er his halls ? ? and not a soul to hear. ? To the boys! Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song? Drunk Lannisters. ( Men laugh ) You've got a pretty voice. Thank you very much. And I like your nose. How many times you break it? Well, now let's see. First time I was five. Me mom smacked me with an iron poker. Ooh. Oh, it wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for me little brother. Now he was a real pest. Second time I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time... Eh, you don't want to know about the third time. Poor nose. Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your ass before the night's through. ( Men laugh ) ( Chatter stops ) Welcome, friends. This round's on me. I don't think he likes me. You think you're a hard man? ( Chuckles, slaps ) I know it. ( Men laugh ) It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company. Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like f*cking and drinking and singing. But killing ... killing's the thing you love. You're just like me. Only smaller. And quicker. Eh? ( Chuckles ) Your Lord Imp is gonna miss you. Aye. ( Slaps ) I expect he will someday. ( Bell tolling ) Man: Here we are. ( Chatter ) One more drink before the war? Shall we? I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror ... a dead king, a city under siege. A wedding. Exactly. Podrick, is that it? \"Is that it?\" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town. I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting. I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting. Do you trust him? Oddly enough, I do. Good. The map you asked for. There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city. Closer to 50. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary. I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship. And if the ship goes down, I go with her. That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, My Lord. Well, I'm not. For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a Red Priestess from Asshai. What of it? You don't believe in the old powers, My Lord? Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting ... what do you think? I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me. Mm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself. And yet I have seen things and heard things ... things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut. No, I don't believe you have. One day I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him. ( Tolling continues ) They're welcoming the new king. I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums. Drums! ( Men shouting ) ( Men shouting ) Tyrion: Remember, wait till the sh1t ... Bronn: The ships are in the bay. They must be far enough in so they won't be ... I know what \"in\" means. Do you know how to use that? I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood. I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an axe. Don't get killed. Nor you, my friend. Oh, are we friends now? Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship. Enhances it, really. Oh, enhances. Fancy word for a sellsword. Been spending time with fancy folks. Lady Sansa and, uh, Sheila. Shae. Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast. She has, My Lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off. Sansa. He's been a great romantic, my nephew. Joffrey: Sansa, come here. I will pray for your safe return, My Lord. Will you? Just as I pray for the King's. Stay safe, My Lady. And you, my lion. Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss. My new blade. Hearteater I've named it. Kiss it. You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my Uncle's blood. Will you slay him yourself? If Stannis is fool enough to come near me. So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the Vanguard? A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the Vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender. Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too. Some of those boys will never come back. Joffrey will. The worst ones always live. Shh. Come, My Lady. ( Men shouting ) ( Neighing ) ( Men shouting ) ( Distant drums beating ) ( Distant drums beating ) Where's our fleet? On the way. Why isn't it here now? They're coming. Hound, tell the Hand that his King has asked him a question. The King has asked you a question. Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy. The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the King ... If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought. That would make me the Quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet. ( Drums beating ) Where are their ships? It is wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise. Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here. If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied. Maybe. ( Babies crying ) I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me. Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else. I doubt it. Maybe she's jealous of you. Why would she be jealous? Sansa. I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming? Yes. Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine. I'm not thirsty, Your Grace. So? I didn't offer you water. What's he doing here? Ser Ilyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him. But we have guards to defend us. Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors. The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups. The battle's first traitors. Have Ser Ilyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning. The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen. ( Door closes ) You said he was here to protect us. He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine. ( Distant drums beating ) ( Men shouting ) There they are. Archers to their marks. Archers, to your marks! Man: Archers! Nock your arrows! Man: Nock arrows! Hold fast. Man: Hold fast! What are you doing? We need to attack them. Hold fast. Man: Boulders ready! Man #2: Hold fast! There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?! There's only one ship. Archers, stand to! Man the below! Nock! Man: Nock and set! Draw! Hold. Man: Hold! There's no one on board. Man: More rocks coming up! Man: Hold. Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear! Matthos! Get down! ( Men screaming ) ( Laughs ) ( Men wailing ) ( Men wailing, shouting ) Prepare to land. Your Grace... The dwarf has played his little trick. The wildfire ... He can only play it once. We're too far from the gates. The fire, their archers ... hundreds will die. Thousands. Come with me and take this city! ( Cheering ) Sansa, come here, little dove. My queen. What are you doing? Praying. You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for? For the Gods to have mercy on us all. Oh. On all of us? Yes, Your Grace. Even me? Of course, Your Grace. Even Joffrey? Joffrey is my ... Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the Gods to have mercy on us all. The Gods have no mercy. That's why they're Gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the Gods would return my mother to me. I was four. Your father doesn't believe in the Gods? He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much. One for her. Here. Sit. Drink. Not like that. Drink, girl. I should have been born a man. I'd rather face 1,000 swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens. They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here. It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits. And if the city should fall? You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience. But this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse. Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink. Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten. More pressure! ( Men shouting, grunting ) Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull! That's it! Steady! He's a serious man ... Stannis Baratheon. They're coming. They're coming ashore. Rain fire on them. Archers! There are too many. Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's gate. Bring any men guarding it here now. Yes, My Lord. Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too. Any of these flaming f*cking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts. ( Men shouting ) Pull, pull! Go! Nock! Draw! Draw! Draw! ( Men shouting ) Man: Kill the Lannisters! Loose! Loose! Man: Form the line! Stannis! Draw! Draw! Loose! Loose! Man: They cannot breach the wall! Yah! The mud gate, go now! First and second squads, to the gate! To the mud gate! Hound: Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his f*cking corpse. ( Screams ) Cersei: When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike. Even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired. You were Robert's queen. And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one. Pretty. That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend. Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service? A few weeks, Your Grace. When did you leave Lorath? I had a Lorathi handmaiden once. But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros? 10 years ago, Your Grace. From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in 10 years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name? Shae, Your Grace. Tell us a story, Shae. When I was 13, I ... ( Door opens ) Your Grace! What news? The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis's fleet destroyed, but... ( Quietly ) But ... but his troops have landed outside the city walls. Where is Joffrey? On the battlements with Lord Tyrion. Bring him back inside at once. But, Your Grace ... What? The King's presence is good for morale. Bring him back to his chambers now. Not here? With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life? No, but I ... Now! When I told you about Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive. ( Screaming ) ( Arrow thunks ) Man: Ah! Help me! ( Man #2 shouting ) Man: We'd better run! Men: Fall back! Get the ladders up! ( Grunts ) Faster, you bastards! Faster! Come on, kill the scum! Someone bring me a drink. f*ck the water. Bring me wine. Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too? Eat sh1t, dwarf. You're on the wrong side of the wall. I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire. Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight. You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city ... your king's city. ( Sniffles ) f*ck the Kingsguard. f*ck the city. f*ck the King. ( Men shouting ) Man: Loose! Man #2: Put your backs into it! All right, get up! Man: Loose! Man #2: Clear! Forward! ( Men shouting ) Loose! Forward ladders! Man: They're coming up the wall! Archers on the north wall! Man #2: Heave! ( Men grunting ) Man #2: Heave! ( Men grunting ) Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep. If you won't defend your own city, why should they? What would you have me do? Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them. What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me? She did not say, Your Grace. Man: All men to the battlements! Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my Uncle and represent the king on the field of battle. Man: Archers, hold your line or I'll kill you myself. Man: Stand fast! No! Get up, you fool. Man: We need more arrows! Man: Where is the king? Why isn't he with us? Man #2: Who are we fighting for? Man #3: Who leads us? ( Softly ) I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack! Man: Yes? Man #2: What are you talking about? Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the King's banner. Men, form up. Men ... men! Come on. They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you? The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates. There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and f*ck them in their asses. ( Men laugh ) ( Pounding ) ( Men grunting ) Man: Heave! Heave! Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape. Heave! Heave! ( Men grunting ) Heave! Heave! ( Men grunting ) Those are brave me knocking at our door. Let's go kill them. ( Cheering ) The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis's troops are at the gates. When the Gold Cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart. Where is my son? I want to escort him back to the battle. Why do I care what you want? Bring me ... Now listen to me ... ah! ( Groaning ) Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? ? Gentle mother ? ? font of mercy ? ? save our sons from war, we pray ? ? gentle ... ? ( Gasps ) You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will. Come with me. I need to say goodbye to someone. The queen said they'd rape everyone. No one is raping me. Go. Run. Women: ? save our sons from war, we pray. ? ( Combatant screams ) The lady is starting to panic. ( Gasps ) What are you doing here? Not here for long. I'm going. Where? Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be. What about the king? He can die just fine on his own. I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell. I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home? I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me. Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father was a killer. Your brother is a killer. Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them. You won't hurt me. No, little bird, I won't hurt you. ( Men grunting ) Heave! Heave! Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders! Ah! Attack! Roll it over! ( Men cheering ) ( Chanting ) Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! ( Chanting continues ) Oh, f*ck me. ( Shouting ) Shh. Be calm, my sweet. They're still fighting. No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods. The Kingswood. Yes, my love. In the Kingswood there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things. Like what? Like stags. Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass. And wolves. My Lord. Cersei: He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, \"You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid. For one day all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow.Ts all the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea ... they will all come to you, little lion... to rest a crown upon your head.\" And the cub said, \"Will I be strong and fierce like my father?\" \"Yes,\" said his mother. \"You will be strong and fierce just like your father.\" I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you. ( Doors open ) ( Men shouting ) Man: Back to the boats! Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you! No! Father. The battle is over. We have won. ( Crying ) ? \"And who are you,\" the proud lord said ? ? \"that I must bow so low? ? ? only a cat of a different coat ? ? that's all the truth I know ? ? in a coat of gold or a coat of red ? ? a lion still has claws ? ? and mine are long and sharp, My Lord ? ? as long and sharp as yours\" ? ? and so he spoke, and so he spoke ? ? that Lord of Castamere ? ? but now the rains weep o'ver his hall ? ? with no one there to hear ? ? yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall ? ? and not a soul to hear. ?", "episode_18": "Theon: Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring 500 men to Winterfell. When do we sail for King's Landing? Soon as I've consolidated my troops. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay. The fist of the First Men. Thousands of years ago the First Men stood here. They came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked. Cersei: Do you really think I'll let you ship Myrcella off to Dorne? Dorne is the safest place for her. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone before I take her from you. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple? And Rickon, too? The little one? Gone, along with the wildling woman. Wait, I know that farm. They'll give us some food. We can't risk it. I've been treating your wounded men. I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender. Come with me to the Crag. Let the Maester show you his stores. ( Grunts ) ( Whistles ) Should have took me while you had the chance. Catelyn: They want your head. Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me. You strangled his son with your chains. He was in my way. You are a man without honor. Brienne, your sword. You have my dragons? I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them. ( Groans ) Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally and what would happen if you did not. What have you done? If there are any among you who still question whether your new lord means what he says... No! ( Theme music playing ) ? Game of Thrones 2x08 ? The Prince of Winterfell Original Air Date on May 20, 2012 ? ( Creaks ) Man: Rider approaching! Man #2: Open the gate! ( Creaking ) ( Horses neighing ) Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell. ( Men laugh ) Envy isn't attractive. What envy? You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men. You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old? ( Men laugh ) I treated the Stark boys with honor and they repaid me with treachery. You treated them with honor by butchering them? Before I had to kill them, I treated them ... you seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn; We take what we need. Exactly. Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery. They made me a promise ... Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest c**t alive? Don't call me a ... A c**t. A dumb c**t who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were? If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak. You are weak. And you're stupid. I'm warning you. Go on, then, warn me. You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot? You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word. Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North. Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out ... He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell. Leave us. Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone. I don't intend to die. You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea. I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones. I already got one crow. Don't need two. Mance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning. The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy. Gut him. He could have killed me half a dozen times. And now he wishes he did. Gut him. He's a b*st*rd of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son. Mance will want him. What does Mance want with a dead man's b*st*rd? I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself. He runs, I'll chop his balls off. He runs, I'll do it meself. We're even now, Jon Snow. I couldn't do it. I had the sword at her neck, I just couldn't ... I know. The others? When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you. They died because of me. See that it wasn't for nothing. All right, up, lad. Come on, on your feet, now. Move it. ( Birds calling, water burbling ) Is she beautiful? I've never met her. What's her name? Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name. I'm sure you'll be very happy. ( Both laugh ) And you're marrying her for a bridge? An important bridge. Ah. It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge. When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father. He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but ... Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me. He once told me that being a Lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, \"how can a man be brave if he's afraid?\" \"That is the only time a man can be brave,\" he told me. I wish I could have met him. He would have liked you. Most Lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors. He didn't care much about gold or glory. And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home. Then why don't you? Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice. Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean. That would be a start. ( Horse neighs, hoofbeats approaching ) Your Grace, Milady. The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night. How? How?! Tell me this isn't true. Why? For the girls. You betrayed me. Robb ... No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway. Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free. I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the father if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell. I grieve for your sons, My Lord. I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me. Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine. Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night. Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer? 40, Your Grace. Send another 40 with our fastest horses. Robb. ( Neighing ) Whoa, oof! ( Groans ) Damn. You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin. A captive Knight has a right to know his captor's identity. Brienne of Tarth. Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord... Selwyn Tarth, your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, My Lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another. Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah! I didn't mean to give offense, My Lady. Forgive me. Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer. Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you? You've harmed others ... those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent. Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly? You will not provoke me to anger. I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight? I've never seen you fight. The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them. All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust. If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens. Do you take me for an idiot? In. I took you for a fighter, a man ... pardon ... woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid. Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer. Kevan: King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force. It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety. Surrender the Iron Throne? Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all. No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep. The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark. Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner. Too close to Casterly Rock. He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. The Greyjoys have done us a great favor. Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force. He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid. We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work. You've got some questions to answer. Man: Who killed Ser Amory? Man #2: I don't know! Give me the name. Man #2: Please! Man #3: Take this one out for the crows. Man #2: I told you, I don't know. Please. Look, it's Yoren's little c**t. Used to be a boy, now it's a girl. ( Man laughs ) Where's Jaqen? Don't care. Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to f*ck you with it. Guard: Come on, time to kill some wolves. ( Men shouting ) You need sour cherries to make it right. And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet. That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust. Where's Jaqen? How would I know? I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight. You need him? He's helping me. Hot Pie: I saw him. Where? Where?! Ow! Where? They went riding out the gates a few hours ago. On patrol. Let go of my ears. ( Horses neighing, men shouting ) What do you want with him anyway? ( Men shouting ) ( Wind howling ) Qhorin: Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth 1,000 fighting against it. They'll never trust me. They might... If you do what needs to be done. What? How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl? I didn't. I should have known better, trusting a traitor's b*st*rd. He's not yours to kill, crow. Do you have to do that here? I like to keep me hands clean. Yes, but do you have to do it here? You should start wearing the gold cloak. I don't want to wear a gold cloak. You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common sellsword. A cloak slows you down in a fight, makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night. Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out. We had a deal, and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it. Fine, fine. No gold cloak. What? What? What? What? Why are you staring at me? ( Scoffs ) You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here? To help me plan the defense of King's Landing. ( Laughs ) Stannis will be here any day. ( Sighs ) And one of these explains how to beat him? \"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros\" by Archmaester \"Shevelathin.\" \"Shevelatesh.\" \"Chevalteesh.\" I'd swap all your books for a few good archers. My Lord Hand, Commander. I must compliment you on the Gold Cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery? I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery? Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves. For questioning? Uh, no. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now. We talked about this. Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Food's worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other. The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town. Given the circumstances, My Lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted. Ah. \"The Great Sieges of Westeros.\" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'vyalthan wasn't a better writer. Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest. The mud gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land. And if Stannis does attack the mud gate, what is our plan? We could throw books at his men. We don't have that many books. We don't have that many men, either. What do we have? Pig sh1t. ( Wind howling ) ( Chatter ) ( Panting ) I'm not cut out for this sort of work. I always imagined meself doing something much worse. We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse. Dolorous Edd: You lack imagination. Sam: Where do you think Jon is right now? He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead. He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter. Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you. He's got a Valyrian steel sword. So did his father. And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive. Great rangers never get old is the problem. sh1t ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time. ( Clangs ) What in seven hells is that? The First Men made these marks. Help me with it. ( Straining ) Look. If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it. That's a Night's Watch cloak. It's been here a long time. Oh, must be Dragonglass. Grenn: Dragonglass? The Maesters call it Obsidian. Why would a brother hide it here? I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it. Mind where you're going. I'm sorry. I'll ... where were you? A man has patrol duty. Tywin Lannister was right here and now he's gone. A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name. How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone? A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not. He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now. This a man cannot do. You promised you'd help me. Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name. And you'll kill them? Anybody? By the seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it. All right. Jaqen H'ghar. A girl gives a man his own name? That's right. Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing. I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself. Un-name me. No. Please? I'll un-name you. Thank you. If you help me and my friends escape. This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain. Fine, Jaqen H'ghar. A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey. A girl will obey. A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight. Thank you, Podrick. Odd little boy. I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys. You and Varys both. Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel. He's only a boy. Younger boys are off fighting his war. He's not ready. What is he, 17? Remember Jaime at 17? Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield. It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us. Do you think I'm an idiot? No, I'd say you possess above average intelligence. You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die. He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert? Do you know why Varys is so dangerous? Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it. Because he doesn't have a cock. Neither do you. Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking. It's not that little. ( Laughs ) Why are you smiling? Because I'm happy. And why are you happy? Because I have your little whore. I thought you preferred blondes. Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Oh, good. Father will be so pleased. Why do you care who I f*ck? Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed. This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me. For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time. Where did you find her? Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully. You've forgotten the most important thing about whores. Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me. You don't buy them; You only rent them. You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough... unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little c**t. And how do I know you haven't killed her already? Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore. I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave. I promise I will free you. Don't forget me. Never. ( Door opens, closes ) I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid. Get out. Shae! I've been waiting all night. What is wrong? You're beautiful. Then why do you look sad? We have to be more careful. Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself. There are people who want to hurt me. I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will. I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine. I'm yours. Promise me. I'm yours, and you are mine. Robb: Still no word? We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My b*st*rd is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle ... Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle ... He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head. Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes. A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much ... Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs. I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer. Your pardon, My Lord. Your Grace. My Lady. How are you? How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north. I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry. No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right. You have every right. You're a king. That's not the kind of king I want to be. What kind do you want to be? I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell. I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry. I'd like to hear you play the harp. No. No, you would not. ( Laughs ) How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet? When I was 12, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there, naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating facedown. My heart just... stopped. I was... I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank... and I screamed at him and I shook him and he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis the slaves have tattoos so you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl ... that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age... I would never live in a slave city again. ( Sighs ) I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on. I don't want to marry the Frey girl. I don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge. ( Laughs ) Hot Pie: The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready. Gendry: Shut up. Probably in the piecrust by now. In the oven, the nice warm oven. Shut up. What did you bring? The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages. What did he want us to do about those guards? He didn't say. He just said, \"walk through the gates. Gendry: What about the guards? He didn't say anything about the guards. What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think? We have to trust him. Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us and you set him free and he ran. I want to go back to the kitchens. Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid. Hot Pie: Arry, don't. Away! Reset! If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day. Will it hold? Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace. Man: Again, pull! I admire you, Ser Davos. I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag. My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me. Do you? Why? My father was a crabber. And? Well, sons of Lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink. And where were those Lords when Storm's End starved? Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King. You defend these men who insult you behind your back. Some are happy to do it to my face. We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark ... they were the heroes, the glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King while I held Storm's End with 500 men. No one has forgotten, Your Grace. No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life. He was only a boy. Then why'd he give him Storm's End? First we ate the horses. We weren't riding anyway, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions. And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe. Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night. I was relieved they did not. Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up because Robert was my older brother and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand. Your Grace... I pray I serve you well. I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge. You're the master of whisperers. You're supposed to know everything. No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, My Lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell. The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike. To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way? If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him. A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you. They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear. Imagine Stannis's terror. I am trying. You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man. Oh, no one disputes that, My Lord, not even the multitudes who despise you. I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men. I wish we could, too. What do you want? Tell me. If we're going to play, you'll have to start. My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of 19. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock. A most highborn plumber. The water never flowed better. And all the sh1t found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand ... You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men, honorable men, but they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game. I do. Last thing I expected. And you play it well. I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over. They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light. The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the Gods such vicious c**ts? Where is the God of tits and wine? In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats. We should sail there immediately. This morning I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives. A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems. She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide. One game at a time, my friend. ( Men shouting ) Jorah: Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have 1,000 eyes watching for you. I found one ... a ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow. Astapor? We cannot stay here. They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children. They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die. You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there. You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve. Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there. That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong. And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember? Until my last breath I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face. They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them. We should bury them. I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message. If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer. What's this? Gold for the farmer. For his trouble. His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now. His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him. Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look. You're right... so far. Who was that out there hung up the gates? Must have been the farmer's boys. He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords? Shh, shh, shh. They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself. Osha: They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.

She circles around YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN.\n\nYOUNG NED: Stop showing off.\n\nYOUNG BENJEN: Lyanna!\n\nBRAN: My Aunt Lyanna. I ve seen her statue in the crypt. My father never talked about her.\n\nCloseup on THREE-EYED RAVEN. He turns to look at BRAN, but BRAN has already walked away. BRAN walks closer to the group.

He gasps, then lets go of the root. The white fades from his eyes. A CHILD OF THE FOREST is sitting nearby, staring at him. He props himself up on his wrists and looks at THREE-EYED RAVEN.\n\nBRAN: You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away.\n\nTHREE-EYED RAVEN: It is beautiful beneath the sea, but if you stay too long, you ll drown.\n\nBRAN: I wasn t drowning.

We ll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs. Nobody needs to die tonight.\n\nDAVOS turns to address the Night s Watch faithfuls.\n\nDAVOS: I ve never been much of a fighter.\n\nDAVOS walks over to Longclaw, JON SNOW s sword, and picks it up.\n\nDAVOS: Apologies for what you re about to see.\n\nDAVOS unsheathes Longclaw. The faithfuls follow suit, drawing their own blades.ALLISER THORNE turns to address a Night s Watchman.\n\nALLISER THORNE: Come on.\n\nThe Night s Watchman lifts and large hammer and walks over to the door. He begins slamming the hammer against the door repeatedly. GHOST begins to growl and bark. DAVOS and company ready themselves for battle. After a number of swings, the Night s Watchman with the hammer breaks a hole in the door. A loud thudding can be heard somewhere behind ALLISER THORNE and company. They turn to see what the noise is. The thudding is coming from one of the courtyard s main gates. WUN WUN breaks down the gate and the Wildlings led by TORMUND and DOLOROUS EDD rush into the courtyard. The Night s Watch loyal to ALLISER THORNE have bows drawn at the Wildlings but do not fire. They back up slowly.\n\nALLISER THORNE: Attack!\n\nALLISER THORNE draws his sword. A Night s Watchman charged TORMUND. TORMUND cuts him down. The other Night s Watch members do not retaliate.\n\nALLISER THORNE: Fight, you cowards!\n\nA Night s Watchman on a balcony shoots WUN WUN in the shoulder with a crossbow bolt. WUN WUN turns to face the man, then grabs him by the legs, slams him against a wall, and tosses his body to the ground in front of ALLISER THORNE. The Night s Watch members allied to ALLISER THORNE begin dropping their weaponry. TORMUND and DOLOROUS EDD approach ALLISER THORNE, swords drawn.\n\nALLISER THORNE (to DOLOROUS EDD): You fucking traitor.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: The only traitors here are the ones who shoved their knives into their Lord Commander s heart.\n\nALLISER THORNE: For thousands of years the Night s Watch has held Castle Black against the Wildlings.\n\nTORMUND: Until you.\n\nOLLY shouts and charges at TORMUND with his sword. TORMUND grabs OLLY and disarms him, then tosses him to another man who restrains him. Two men take ALLISER THORNE by the arms.\n\nDOLOROUS EDD: Throw them into the cells where they belong.\n\nThe men drag ALLISER THORNE, OLLY, and the Night s Watch betrayers away. TORMUND, DOLOROUS EDD, and DAVOS enter the room where JON SNOW s body is. They stare down at him and his wounds.\n\nTORMUND: Took a lot of knives. I ll have my men get the wood for a fire. Bodies to burn.\nEXT. KING S LANDING COMMONS - DAYMany male commoners are gathered together at a place for eating. They are all watching one commoner man tell a story.\n\nSTORYTELLER: Right, so there she is, high and mighty Queen Cersei, tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.\n\nThe commoners laugh.\n\nSTORYTELLER: All of a sudden she looks my way. Gives me a little smile like,  Well?  So, all right, you know, I ve never been shy and I m blessed down south, so I put it right out. She s never seen anything like it. I mean, she s used to her brother, and from what I hear, Jaime Lannister s half an inch shy of an inch. She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips. Well, you all know me. You know I wouldn t lie about this.\n\nThe STORYTELLER walks into a dark alleyway to relieve himself. He is drunk. GREGOR walks up behind him. The STORYTELLER looks up at GREGOR. GREGOR bounces his head off the wall, killing him, then walks away.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBER\n\nCERSEI is standing in the center of the room,. She pulls a loose thread from the sleeve of her dress and examines it. GREGOR enters. CERSEI walks past him and exits her chamber. GREGOR follows. When they reach the bottom of the steps, they are confronted by a group of the king s soldiers.\n\nCERSEI: Get out of my way.\n\nKING S SOLDIER: King s orders, Your Grace.\n\nCERSEI: What are the king s orders?\n\nKING S SOLDIER: He would like you to remain in the Red Keep, Your Grace, for your own protection.\n\nCERSEI: You re barring me from attending my own daughter s funeral?\n\nKING S SOLDIER: Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king s command, I cannot let you pass.\n\nCERSEI: I would like to speak to my son.\n\nKING S SOLDIER: He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.\n\nGREGOR grabs the hilt of his sword. The king s soldiers also take hold of their weapons. GREGOR looks at CERSEI. CERSEI turns and walks back up the stairs. GREGOR follows.\n\nCUT TO: KING'S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nTOMMEN and JAIME are standing beside the body of MYRCELLA. She has funeral stones over her eyes, with painted eyes on them.\n\nTOMMEN: She grew up.\n\nJAIME: Almost.\n\nTOMMEN: Have we caught Prince Trystane s killers? I expect it was Mother.\n\nJAIME: Your mother wouldn t do that.\n\nTOMMEN: Yes, she would.\n\nJAIME: Are you angry with her?\n\nTOMMEN: Of course not.\n\nJAIME: Then why didn t you let her come? She has every right to be here.\n\nTOMMEN: They told me she wouldn t be allowed in the sept. If she had tried --\n\nJAIME: They re not putting your mother in a cell ever again. Not while I m here. Why haven t you gone to see her? Everything she endured, she did it for you.\n\nTOMMEN: Don t you think I know that? I m sorry. But I can t.\n\nJAIME: Why not?\n\nTOMMEN: When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery, what did I do? When they paraded her through the streets like a whore, what did I do?\n\nJAIME: We all fail sometimes.\n\nTOMMEN: The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm. If I can t even protect my own wife or my own mother, what good am I?\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW enters the sept. JAIME takes TOMMEN by the shoulder.\n\nJAIME: Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you.\n\nJAIME and TOMMEN to address the HIGH SPARROW.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Your Grace. Lord Commander.\n\nTOMMEN: I want to see my wife.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: The gods wait for Queen Margaery to confess her crimes and seek their mercy. The king must wait as well.\n\nJAIME: Go and see your mother, Tommen.\n\nTOMMEN exits.\n\nJAIME: You re a bold man.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: On the contrary. I fear a great deal. The Father, the Mother, the Warrior.\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW approaches MYRCELLA s body.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Do you know why we use these stones? To remind us not to fear death. We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next.\n\nJAIME: You must long for the next life.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: In truth, I fear that, too.\n\nJAIME: You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Your sister sought the gods  mercy and atoned for her sin.\n\nJAIME: What about my sins?\n\nJAIME approaches the HIGH SPARROW.\n\nJAIME: I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back. I killed my own cousin. When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice. What atonement do I deserve?\n\nJAIME grips the hilt of his dagger and partially draws it.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: You would spill blood in this holy place?\n\nJAIME: Oh, the gods won t mind. They ve spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Go on, then. I deserve it. We all do. We are weak, vain creatures. We live only by the Mother s mercy.\n\nA great number of the Faith Militant encircle JAIME and the HIGH SPARROW on the steps of the sept.\n\nJAIME: They should be closer if you mean for them to save you.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: I don t. They d never reach me before you struck.\n\nJAIME: I ve fought against worse odds.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: No doubt many of us would fall. But who are we, hmm? We have no names, no family. Every one of us is poor and powerless. And yet together, we can overthrow an empire.\n\nThe HIGH SPARROW walks slowly away from JAIME.\n\nCUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI S CHAMBER\n\nCERSEI is looking over the balcony at King s Landing. TOMMEN enters her chamber.\n\nTOMMEN: Mother.\n\nCERSEI walks in from the balcony.\n\nCERSEI: Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?\n\nTOMMEN: Gold.\n\nCERSEI: Good. It was always her color.\n\nCERSEI walks over to a side table and drinks a sip of wine. Her back is facing TOMMEN.\n\nTOMMEN: I m sorry for keeping you here. I shouldn t have, but I was -- I didn t want to lose you again.\n\nCERSEI: I understand. I m glad to see you.\n\nTOMMEN: I know I should have come sooner. I wanted to. I was wrong.\n\nCERSEI: It s all right.\n\nTOMMEN: No, it isn t.\n\nCERSEI turns to face TOMMEN.\n\nTOMMEN: I should have executed all of them. I should have pulled down the sept onto the High Sparrow s head before I let them do that to you, as you would have for me. You raised me to be strong...and I wasn t. But I want to be. Help me.\n\nCERSEI: Always.\n\nCERSEI and TOMMEN embrace.\nEXT. MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - NIGHTThe golden statue previously knocked from the top of the pyramid lies in the sand at the foot of the pyramid.\n\nCUT TO: GREAT PYRAMID - ROYAL CHAMBERS\n\nTYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are gathered together in council. TYRION pours himself a glass of wine. VARYS tsks at him.\n\nTYRION: If I lost my cock, I d drink all the time.\n\nTYRION looks at GREY WORM.\n\nTYRION: Meaning no offense. He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes.\n\nVARYS: I do not make dwarf jokes.\n\nTYRION: You think them.\n\nVARYS sighs.\n\nVARYS: So, the fleet. It s been burned.\n\nGREY WORM: We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything.\n\nTYRION: Surely there s some good news lurking somewhere.\n\nVARYS: Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.\n\nTYRION: Perhaps they can tell us their secret.\n\nVARYS: The Masters have retaken both cities. Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver s Bay has returned to the slavers.\n\nTYRION: What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.\n\nMISSANDEI: They are not eating. They haven t touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.\n\nTYRION: Daenerys is the dragon queen. Can t very well let the dragons starve, that s obvious.\n\nGREY WORM: If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?\n\nTYRION: Dragons do not do well in captivity.\n\nMISSANDEI: How do you know this?\n\nTYRION: That s what I do. I drink and I know things.\n\nTYRION finishes his glass of wine and walks over to the pitcher to pour himself another glass.\n\nTYRION: The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles. Then Daenerys s ancestors started chaining them up in pens. A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats. They must be unchained or they ll waste away. Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?\n\nMISSANDEI: Many times.\n\nTYRION: And did they ever harm you?\n\nMISSANDEI: Never.\n\nTYRION: Dragons are intelligent. More intelligent than men according to some maesters. They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies. I am their friend.\n\nVARYS: Do they know that?\n\nTYRION: They will. It s time they had their supper.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN - CATACOMBS\n\nTYRION and VARYS enter the dragons  holding chamber bearing torches. TYRION begins walking slowly down the steps. VARYS remains at the top. When TYRION reaches the floor, he pauses and stares into the darkness. Faint growling can be heard. TYRION stops and looks back at VARYS momentarily. RHAEGAL and VISERION emerge from the shadows. VISERION lights a fire in his mouth and roars at TYRION. RHAEGAL approaches with a small roar.\n\nTYRION (to RHAEGAL): I m friends with your mother. I m here to help. Don t eat the help.\n\nTYRION chuckles nervously. RHAEGAL growls at TYRION. TYRION approaches cautiously.\n\nTYRION: When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day. I begged him for one of you.  It wouldn t even have to be a big dragon,  I told him.  It could be little, like me. \n\nTYRION sets down his torch and gets closer to RHAEGAL.\n\nTYRION: Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard. Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago. I cried myself to sleep that night.\n\nTYRION touches RHAEGAL on the neck.\n\nTYRION: But here you are.\n\nTYRION takes hold of the piston keeping RHAEGAL s shackle closed and pulls it free. The shackle falls the ground. TYRION turns around to see VISERION growling at him. VISERION exposes his neck to TYRION. TYRION approaches and releases the piston from VISERION s shackle. RHAEGAL and VISERION return to the shadows. TYRION picks up his torch and hurries up the steps.\n\nTYRION: Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face.\n\nEXT. BRAAVOS COMMONS - DAY\n\nARYA is sitting on the ground against the wall of a street. The WAIF appears, staff in hand.\n\nWAIF: What s your name?\n\nARYA grabs her staff and rushes to her feet. The WAIF smacks ARYA in the face, drawing blood. ARYA approaches the sound of the WAIF s voice, but the WAIF has already moved to the side.\n\nWAIF: What s your name?\n\nARYA: No one.\n\nWAIF: I don t believe that.\n\nARYA swings her staff at the WAIF, but misses. The WAIF hits ARYA in the side.\n\nWAIF: You don t believe that.\n\nARYA swings her staff at the WAIF again, but misses again. The WAIF hits ARYAoin the other side. ARYA rushes towards the WAIF and trips on some steps, falling to the ground. She grabs her staff and stands back up. The WAIF hits ARYA three more times, knocking her to the ground on the third. ARYA stands up and swings at the WAIF again, and misses for a third time. The WAIF hits ARYA in the face, knocking her to the ground again. ARYA is panting heavily. She returns to her feet, screams, and swings her staff around her many times. The WAIF has disappeared. The Faceless Man, taking on the visage of JAQEN H GHAR, catches ARYA s staff mid-swing.\n\nJAQEN: Who are you?\n\nARYA: No one.\n\nJAQEN: If a girl says her name, a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight.\n\nARYA: A girl has no name.\n\nJAQEN: If a girl says her name, a man will feed her tonight.\n\nARYA: A girl has no name.\n\nJAQEN: If a girl says her name, a man will give her eyes back.\n\nARYA: A girl has no name.\n\nJAQEN releases ARYA s staff.\n\nJAQEN: Come.\n\nARYA turns around and walks to her beggar basket.\n\nJAQEN: Leave it. A girl is not a beggar anymore.\n\nARYA follows JAQEN.\n\nINT. WINTERFELL - DINING HALL\n\nROOSE, RAMSAY, and LORD KARSTARK are gathered at the dining table, talking.

Her brother s at Castle Black.\n\nLORD KARSTARK: Ned Stark s last surviving son?\n\nROOSE: Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.\n\nRAMSAY: So was I, Father.\n\nLORD KARSTARK: Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door.\n\nRAMSAY: Castle Black isn t defended on the southern side. And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves. With a small force we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow --\n\nROOSE: Murder the Lord Commander of the Night s Watch? You d unite every house in the North against us.\n\nRAMSAY: We don t need every house in the North. The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks. command more soldiers than all the other houses combined. With their support, none could challenge us.\n\nLORD KARSTARK: The Starks lost my house the day King Rob cut off my father s head. It s time for new blood in the North.\n\nROOSE looks at both his son and lord Karstark. He gets up and stands in front of them.\n\nROOSE: If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog, you ll be treated as a mad dog. Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed.\n\nMAESTER WOLKAN enters and interrupts them.\n\nMAESTER WOLKAN: My lords. Lady Walda has given birth. A boy.

Poisoned by our enemies.\n\nMAESTER WOLKAN does not respond.\n\nRAMSAY: How did he die?\n\nMAESTER WOLKAN: Poisoned by his enemies.\n\nLORD KARSTARK: You're talking to your lord. Use respect.\n\nMAESTER WOLKAN: Forgive me, my lord.\n\nRAMSAY: Send for Lady Walda and the baby.\n\nMAESTER WOLKAN: She s resting, my lord.\n\nRAMSAY glares at MAESTER WOLKAN.\n\nMAESTER WOLKAN: At once, my lord.\n\nRAMSAY looks down at ROOSE's body.\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL - COMMONS\n\nRAMSAY is standing alone.

I ll go back to the Riverlands. Please. Ramsay. He s your brother.\n\nRAMSEY: I prefer being an only child.\n\nRAMSEY whisles at the dogs. They exit their pens and attack LADY WALDA and the baby. LADY WALDA screams. The dogs kill them.\n\nEXT. NORTHERN WILDERNESS - DAY\n\nTHEON is gathering wood. He glances at SANSA and BRIENNE, who are in conversation.

She disappeared.\n\nSANSA: How did she look?\n\nBRIENNE: She looked good. She wasn t exactly dressed like a lady.\n\nSANSA smiles.\n\nSANSA: No, she wouldn t be.\n\nBRIENNE: What happened at Winterfell?\n\nSANSA pauses and tears up.\n\nSANSA: I should ve gone with you while I had the chance.\n\nBRIENNE: It was a difficult choice, my lady.\n\nBRIENNE looks at THEON.\n\nBRIENNE: We ve all had to make difficult choices.\n\nTHEON stands up and walks away from PODRICK. SANSA stands and walks to THEON.\n\nTHEON: We shouldn t be lighting fires. It s not safe. He won t stop hunting us.\n\nSANSA: We just have to make it to Castle Black. Once we re with Jon, Ramsay won t be able to touch us.\n\nTHEON: Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.\n\nSANSA: I won t let him. I ll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.\n\nTHEON: And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place? The truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded?\n\nSANSA looks to the ground.\n\nTHEON: And the truth about Rob, who I betrayed?\n\nSANSA: When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven.\n\nTHEON: I don t want to be forgiven. I can never make amends to your family for all the things that I ve done. They ll keep you safer than I ever could.\n\nSANSA: You re not coming with us?\n\nTHEON: I would have taken you all the way to the Wall. I would have died to get you there.\n\nSANSA hugs THEON. They both cry.\n\nTHEON: May I take one of the horses?\n\nSANSA: Where will you go?\n\nTHEON: Home.\n\nEXT.

Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.\n\nBALON: They we will take more.\n\nYARA: Why? For more pinecones and rocks?\n\nBALON turns around to face YARA.\n\nBALON: Because I order it.\n\nYARA: We can defeat anyone at sea, but we ll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies.\n\nBALON walks to YARA.\n\nBALON: Not if our captains defy my orders, abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish mission.\n\nYARA: I won t apologize for trying to rescue Theon.\n\nBALON: Then where is he?\n\nYARA: Where is your kingdom? We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war. That war is over. The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers. I lost two brothers that day.\n\nBALON: And I lost three sons. The War of the Five Kings, they call it. Well, the other four are dead. When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you wan. But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will.\n\nBALON exits the hall.\n\nCUT TO: PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE\n\nRain is pouring down. BALON begins to cross the unsteady bridge. He leans on the ropes and looks down at the ocean, then sees a cloaked figure on the other side of the bridge.\n\nBALON: Let me pass. You fool, move aside for your king.\n\nHOODED FIGURE: Haven t I always, brother?\n\nThe hooded figure takes off his hood, revealing his identity. He is EURON GREYJOY. BALON walks a few steps closer.\n\nBALON: I thought you d be rotting under some foreign sea by now.\n\nEURON: What is dead may never die.\n\nBALON does not respond.\n\nEURON: Has the custom changed since I ve been gone? Aren t you supposed to repeat the words?\n\nBALON: You can mock our god without my help.\n\nEURON: I don t mock the Drowned God. I am the Drowned God. From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray.\n\nThe wind buffets the bridge back and forth. BALON tries to hold his balance. EURON chuckles.\n\nEURON: You re old, brother. You've had your time. Now let another rule.\n\nBALON walks towards his brother.\n\nBALON: I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea. They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.\n\nEURON: They did.\n\nBALON: And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues.\n\nEURON: I needed silence.\n\nBALON: What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm?\n\nEURON: I am the storm, brother. The first storm and the last. And you re in my way.\n\nBALON draws a knife and slashes EURON across the face. EURON throws BALON off the bridge. BALON falls to his death.\n\nCUT TO: PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY\n\nMany Ironborn are in attendance for BALON's funeral. AERON GREYJOY and several Drowned Men are gathered around BALON's body.

Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children.\n\nALL: What is dead may never die.\n\nYARA: I m going to find out who did this. I m going to feed them to the sharks while they live. I swear it by the Salt Throne.\n\nAERON: The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.\n\nYARA: My father would ve wanted me to rule.\n\nAERON: Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear. Perhaps you'll win. Perhaps you ll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn. And perhaps not.\nINT. CASTLE BLACK - MELISANDRE S CHAMBERMELISANDRE is sitting at the fireplace. Someone knocks on the door.\n\nMELISANDRE: Come in.\n\nDAVOS enters.\n\nDAVOS: I'm sorry, my lady. I didn t mean to interrupt.\n\nMELISANDRE: You interrupt nothing.\n\nDAVOS looks at the fireplace and then at MELISANDRE.\n\nDAVOS: I assume you know why I m here.\n\nMELISANDRE: I will after you tell me.\n\nDAVOS: It s about the Lord Commander.\n\nMELISANDRE: The former Lord Commander.\n\nDAVOS: Does he have to be?\n\nMELISANDRE looks at DAVOS.\n\nMELISANDRE: What are you asking?\n\nDAVOS: Do you know of any magic...that could help him?

It could be now.\n\nMELISANDRE: Not for me.\n\nMELISANDRE stands and walks away from her chair. DAVOS walks towards her.\n\nDAVOS: Not for you? I saw you drink poison that should ve killed you. I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.\n\nMELISANDRE: Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie.\n\nMELISANDRE looks at DAVOS.\n\nMELISANDRE: You were right all along. The Lord never spoke to me.\n\nDAVOS: Fuck him, then. Fuck all of them. I m not a devout man, obviously. Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.\n\nDAVOS comes a step closer to MELISANDRE\n\nDAVOS: I m not asking the Lord of Light for help.I m asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.\n\nMELISANDRE: I never had this gift.\n\nDAVOS: Have you ever tried?\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - ROOM\n\nDAVOS, TORMUND, DOLOROUS EDD, and MELISANDRE are gathered around JON SNOW's body. GHOST is sleeping on the floor. MELISANDRE is performing a ritual on JON SNOW's body. She wrings out a wet cloth with which she cleans out the wounds of JON SNOW. She cuts his hair and beard and throws the hairs in a firepit. Then she places her hands on JON SNOW's chest and utters an incantation in Valyrian. She sighs.\n\nMELISANDRE: Please.\n\nMELISANDRE lets her hands down slowly. She has tears in her eyes and looks to DAVOS. TORMUND scoffs and exits, followed by MELISANDRE and DOLOROUS EDD. DAVOS lingers and stares at JON SNOW's body, but eventually exits. GHOST suddenly wakes up and looks at JON SNOW. JON SNOW's eyes snap open and he gasps for breath.\nCREDITS\n\n", "episode_48": "\n\nINT. MEEREEN - PYRAMID\n\nJORAH: Your Grace, I want to say--\n\nDAENERYS: You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?\n\nTYRION: If only I were otherwise.\n\nDAENERYS: If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine\n\nTYRION: You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.\n\nDAENERYS: So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?\n\nTYRION: Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It s too soon to know if you deserve my service.\n\nDAENERYS: If you d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.\n\nTYRION: When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.\n\nDAENERYS: And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?\n\nTYRION: Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.\n\nDAENERYS: I have a very large army and very large dragons.\n\nTYRION: Killing and politics aren t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.\n\nDAENERYS: So you want to advise me. Very well. (looks to Jorah) What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.\n\nTYRION: I know.\n\nDAENERYS: Why should the people trust a queen who can t keep her promises?\n\nTYRION: Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you.\n\nTyrion approaches Daenerys and Missandei. Her guards raise their spears to her. Daenerys waves them off.\n\nTYRION: Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?\n\nDAENERYS: Yes, many opportunities.\n\nTYRION: And did he?\n\nDAENERYS: No. Not until forced to do so.\n\nTYRION: He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him.\n\nDAENERYS: So I should kill him?\n\nTYRION: A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do.\n\nDAENERYS: Remove Ser Jorah from the city.\n\nDaenerys and Jorah hold back tears. Jorah is escorted out of the Pyramid. Jorah checks his Greyscale and walks away.\n\nINT. BLACK CELLS\n\nThe Septa holds water out to Cersei.\n\nSEPTA: Confess.\n\nCERSEI: My son. Let me speak to--\n\nShe slaps Cersei with a spoon.\n\nSEPTA: Confess. I meant it.\n\nCERSEI: My face will be the last thing you see before--\n\nShe slaps her with a spoon again then leaves. Cersei starts screaming.\n\nINT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE\n\nARYA: My name is Lana. I m an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. BRAAVOS - MARKET\n\nArya pushes an oyster cart through a crowded market.\n\nARYA (V.O.): Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--\n\nCUT TO: INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE\n\nJaqen slaps her.\n\nARYA: Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade.\n\nJAQEN: Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.\n\nARYA: How will she serve him?\n\nJAQEN: She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.\n\nARYA: What will she do there?\n\nJAQEN: She will see.\n\nARYA: See what?\n\nJAQEN: How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her.\n\nARYA: Oysters, clams and cockles!\n\nArya takes a right with the cart.\n\nARYA: Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!\n\nTHIN MAN: Your oysters fresh?\n\nARYA: Best in the city.\n\nTHIN MAN: You wouldn t lie to an old man would you?\n\nArya cracks an oyster and hands him one he slurps it.\n\nTHIN MAN: Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.\n\nA man throws a bag of money and a map on the Thin Man s table.\n\nMAN: It s my 18th voyage. I ve returned from all of them without a scratch on me.\n\nTHIN MAN: Can t do it.\n\nMAN: Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don t understand?\n\nHe is carried away as the Thin Man slurps the oyster\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE\n\nJAQEN: The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.\n\nARYA: So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?\n\nJAQEN: A girl tells a man that she has seen.\n\nARYA: If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money.\n\nJAQEN: But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn t have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?\n\nArya looks to see a man praying on the floor.\n\nARYA: The Many Faced God. You said you didn t know what I would see at the docks.\n\nJAQEN: A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.\n\nARYA: And then what?\n\nJAQEN: A gift for the Thin Man.\n\nHe holds up a clear vile. Arya takes the vile, smiling.\n\nWAIF: She is not ready.\n\nJAQEN: Perhaps she is, perhaps she s not.\n\nWAIF: And if she s not?\n\nJAQEN: It is all the same to the Many Faced God.\n\nINT. BLACK CELLS\n\nQyburn enters the cell and bows.\n\nQYBURN: The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.\n\nCERSEI: The charges?\n\nQYBURN: Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert.\n\nCERSEI: All lies.\n\nQYBURN: Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you ll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason.\n\nCERSEI: I wish you d said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?\n\nQYBURN: I m afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council.\n\nCERSEI: Tell him I need to speak to him.\n\nQYBURN: I implored him to visit you but he would not.\n\nCERSEI: What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--\n\nQYBURN: Your arrest, and Queen Margaery s arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched.\n\nCERSEI: You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother.\n\nQYBURN: I tried my grace, he wouldn t see me. He wouldn t see anyone.\n\nCERSEI: I can t stay here.\n\nQYBURN: There is a way, Your Grace. A way out.\n\nCERSEI: Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won t. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness.\n\nThe septa enters the room.\n\nQYBURN: Goodbye my queen. The work continues.\n\nQyburn leaves the cell.\n\nINT. WINTERFELL - SANSA S CHAMBER\n\nTheon enters Sansa s room and sets food down.\n\nSANSA: Why. Why Theon.\n\nTHEON: Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.\n\nSANSA: Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?\n\nTHEON: I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left.\n\nSANSA: Good. If it weren t for you I d still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would.\n\nTHEON: I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.\n\nTHEON: They weren t  those boys , they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you d know them since they were born.\n\nTHEON: They weren t. They were only--\n\nSANSA: Only what?\n\nTHEON: I can t..\n\nSANSA: Tell me!\n\nTHEON: I can t, not unless the master says...\n\nSANSA: Tell me, they weren t what?!\n\nTHEON: They weren t...\n\nSANSA Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren t your brothers!\n\nTHEON: They weren t Bran and Rickon! I couldn t find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.\n\nSANSA: You didn t ?\n\nTheon shakes his head no.\n\nSANSA: Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?\n\nTHEON: I can t talk to you anymore.\n\nSANSA: Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--\n\nTHEON: Not Theon, Reek!\n\nTheon runs out the door.\n\nINT. WINTERFELL - HALL\n\nBOLTON BANNERMAN: Our scouts tells us he s got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however.\n\nROOSE: And how high can Stannis  horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny.\n\nRamsay gives a disagreeing look.\n\nROOSE: You disagree?\n\nRAMSAY: Stannis isn t from the North. You are, father. I think you re missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders.\n\nROOSE: And what do you recommend?\n\nRAMSAY: That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows.\n\nROOSE: A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can t touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn t get an army through if we wanted to.\n\nRAMSAY: I don t need an army. I need 20 good men.\n\nINT. MEEREEN\n\nDAENERYS: So have you decided yet? Whether I m worthy of your service?\n\nTYRION: Have you decided yet whether you re going to have me killed?\n\nDAENERYS: It s probably my safest option.\n\nTYRION: I can see why you would think so. It s what your father would have done.\n\nDAENERYS: And what would your father do?\n\nTYRION: My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.\n\nDAENERYS: Is that why you killed him?\n\nTYRION: Some day if you decide not to execute me, I ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we ll need more wine than this.\n\nDAENERYS: I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.\n\nTYRION: So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers.\n\nDAENERYS: I m terrible?\n\nTYRION: I ve heard stories.\n\nDANERYS: Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?\n\nTYRION: To see if you were the right kind of terrible.\n\nDAENERYS: Which kind is that?\n\nTYRION: The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.\n\nDAENERYS: I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.\n\nTYRION:  Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed.\n\nDAENERYS: Perhaps it won t come to that.\n\nTYRION: It s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.\n\nDAENERYS: Varys? King Robert s spy master?\n\nTYRION: Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.\n\nDAENERYS: Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.\n\nTYRION: He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn t have to do. I suspect he s the main reason you weren t slaughtered in your crib.\n\nDAENERYS: But you trust him?\n\nTYRION: Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother.\n\nDAENERYS: The brother who killed my father.\n\nTYRION: That s the one.\n\nDAENERYS: Perhaps I will have you killed after all.\n\nTYRION: Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting.\n\nDAENERYS: I m not going to kill you.\n\nTYRION: No? Banish me?\n\nDAENERYS: No.\n\nTYRION: So if I m not going to be murdered, and I m not going to be banished...\n\nDAENERYS: You re going to advise me. (takes his wine cup) While you can still speak in complete sentences.\n\nTYRION: Advise you on what?\n\nDAENERYS: How to get what I want.\n\nTYRION: The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.\n\nDAENERYS: If I want jokes I ll get myself a proper fool.\n\nTYRION: I m not entirely joking. There s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.\n\nDAENERYS: I fought so that no child born into Slaver s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.\n\nTYRION: And when you get back to your home, who supports you?\n\nDAENERYS: The common people.\n\nTYRION: Let s be generous and assume that s going to happen. Here in Slaver s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough.\n\nDAENERYS: Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They re all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground.\n\nTYRION: It s a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You re not the first person to have dreamt it.\n\nDAENERYS: I m not going to stop the wheel. I m going to break the wheel.\n\nEXT. FIGHTING PIT\n\nTwo gladiators spar. Jorah walks to the pit. The master whistles for them to stop fighting. Jorah flips him a coin.\n\nJORAH: You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.\n\nMASTER: You struck me.\n\nJORAH: I ve been flogged if it makes you happy. I m the best you ve got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?\n\nMASTER: You re a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?\n\nJORAH: Let me fight for her and I belong to you.\n\nINT. BLACK CELLS\n\nSEPTA: Thirsty? Confess.\n\nCERSEI: I ll get out of here, you realize. Before long.\n\nSEPTA: Confess.\n\nCERSEI: I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.\n\nSEPTA: Confess.\n\nCERSEI: I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die.\n\nShe dumps her water out on the floor. Cersei licks it from the floor when she leaves.\n\nINT. CASTLE BLACK - SAM S ROOM\n\nGILLY: Does it hurt?\n\nSAM: No.\n\nGILLY: Good.\n\nSAM: How are you?\n\nGILLY: I m not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.\n\nSAM: You know what I mean.\n\nGILLY: I m good.\n\nSAM: Are you scared?\n\nGILLY: A little.\n\nSAM: Me too.\n\nThere is a knock on the door. Sam grabs his knife.\n\nSAM: Who s there?\n\nOLLY: Olly.\n\nSam puts the knife down.\n\nSAM: Come in.\n\nOLLY: I heard what happened.\n\nSAM: Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It s only natural.\n\nOlly sets a tray of food on Sam s bed.\n\nOLLY: Figured you were hungry.\n\nSAM: You re a good lad.\n\nOLLY: Wanted to ask you something. (Olly looks at Gilly) If you ve got the time.\n\nGILLY: I need to check on baby Sam.\n\nShe exits the room.\n\nSAM: Now then. How can I help?\n\nOLLY: It s about the Lord Commander.\n\nSAM: Yes?\n\nOLLY: He s going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.\n\nSAM: We ve been fighting them for years.\n\nOLLY: This wasn t a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why s he saving them?\n\nSAM: Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones.\n\nOLLY: The one he s travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village.\n\nSAM: Olly...\n\nOLLY: How can he trust him?\n\nSAM: I ve seen the army of the dead. I ve seen the white walkers, and they re coming for us, for all the living. And when it s time we ll need every last man we can find.\n\nOLLY: But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?\n\nSAM: Jon s taking a risk, but he has to. We don t stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run.\n\nOLLY: You believe that?\n\nSAM: With all my heart.\n\nOlly looks conflicted. He walks towards the door.\n\nSAM: Try not to worry Olly. I ve been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.\n\nEXT. HARDHOME - SHORE\n\nThe ships full of Crows and wildlings dock at Hardhome. Jon and Tormund get out together. The camera fixates on the swords on their hips.\n\nTORMUND: You trust me Jon Snow?\n\nJON: Does that make me a fool?\n\nTORMUND: We are fools together now.\n\nThey walk to meet the men and women of Hardhome, lead by the Lord of Bones.\n\nTORMUND: Lord of Bones. Been a long time.\n\nLORD OF BONES: Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?\n\nTORMUND: War.\n\nLORD OF BONES: You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.\n\nTORMUND: We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.\n\nLORD OF BONES: You don t give the orders here.\n\nTORMUND: I m not giving an order.\n\nLORD OF BONES: Why aren t you in chains?\n\nJON: He s not my prisoner.\n\nLORD OF BONES: What is he?\n\nJON: We re allies.\n\nThe Hardhome wildlings complain loudly.\n\nLORD OF BONES: You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.\n\nTORMUND: I don t fight for the crows.\n\nJON: We re not here to fight. We re here to talk.\n\nLORD OF BONES: Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you re done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--\n\nTormund grabs the Lord of Bones  staff from him and beats him to death with it.\n\nTORMUND: Gather the elders and let s talk.\n\nINT. HARDHOME - CABIN\n\nJon is surrounded by Karsi, a Wildling chieftess, Loboda, a Thenn, a Wildling elder, and various other Wildlings.\n\nJON: My name s Jon Snow. I m Lord Commander of the Night s Watch. We re not friends. We ve never been friends. We won t become friends today. This isn t about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what s out there.\n\nKARSI: You built that wall to keep us out.\n\nLOBODA: Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?\n\nJON: In normal times we wouldn t. But these aren t normal times. The white walkers don t care if a man s Free Folk or Crow. We re all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.\n\nKARSI: Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.\n\nJon holds the bag full of Dragonstone to Karsi. She looks at it hesitantly.\n\nJON: It s not a trick. It s a gift for those who join us.\n\nKarsi examine the glass in shock.\n\nJON: Dragonglass. A man of the Night s Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.\n\nLOBODA: You saw this?\n\nJON: No. But I trust the man.\n\nKARSI: There are old stories about Dragonglass.\n\nLOBODA: There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.\n\nKARSI: And with the things we ve seen you don t believe them?\n\nJON: Come with me and I'll share these weapons.\n\nKARSI: Come with you where?\n\nJON: There are good lands south of the wall.  The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.\n\nThere is hesitation.\n\nJON: I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We re prepared to give you that new life.\n\nKARSI: If ?\n\nJON: If you swear you join us when the real war begins.\n\nLOBODA: Where is Mance?\n\nJON: He died.\n\nLOBODA: How?\n\nJON (after a long pause): I put an arrow through his heart.\n\nThe wildlings in the cabin start to riot.\n\nLOBODA: I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.\n\nLoboda brandishes his axe. Tormund steps forward.\n\nTORMUND: None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt s orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that s what we need today: the courage to make peace with men we ve been fighting for generations.\n\nKARSI: I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows.\n\nJON: I m not asking you to forget your dead. I ll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I m asking you to think about your children now. They ll never have children of their own if we don t band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can t stop them. The Night s Watch can t stop them. And all the southern kings can t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we ll give the fuckers a fight.\n\nThere are small nods of approval throughout the room.\n\nKARSI: You vouch for this man, Tormund?\n\nTORMUND: He s prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He s young, but he knows how to lead. He didn t have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him.\n\nLOBODA: My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.\n\nKARSI: So would mine, but fuck 'em, they re dead.\n\nKarsi walks in front of Jon.\n\nI ll never trust a man in black.\n\nKarsi walks over to Tormund.\n\nBut I trust you, Tormund. If you say this is the way, we re with you.\n\nTORMUND: This is the way.\n\nWILDLING ELDER: I m with Tormund. We stay here we re dead men. At least with King Crow there s a chance.\n\nGIANT: Tormund.\n\nLOBODA: Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they re gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That s our enemy. That has always been our enemy.\n\nWildlings start leaving the cabin and head towards the boats.\n\nKARSI (to Tormund): I fucking hate Thenns.\n\nTormund nods.\n\nEXT. HARDHOME - SHORE\n\nJon, Tormund, and Karsi lead the Wildlings to the boats.\n\nJON: How many are with us? 5000?\n\nTORMUND: I m not good at counting.\n\nJON: We re leaving too many behind.\n\nTORMUND: The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.\n\nJON: And he knew them better than I ever will.\n\nTORMUND: They re running out of food and there s nothing to hunt. They ll come around.\n\nCut to Karsi loading two children onto a boat.\n\nKARSI: Johnna is gonna look after you. She s in charge, you listen to her.\n\nDAUGHTER: I wanna go with you.\n\nKARSI: I need to get the old folks on the boats. I m right behind you, I promise. (she kisses them on the forehead) Go on.\n\nINT. HARDHOME - CABIN\n\nThe Giant picks up a piece of Dragonglass and strokes it intently. Edd begins picking up the pieces of glass and looks at the giant with his piece of glass. Wun Wun turns to Edd and stares at him annoyed.\n\nWUN WUN: Lokh kif rukh?\n\nEdd leaves. Dogs are barking outside.\n\nEXT. HARDHOME - SHORE\n\nJon loads girls onto a boat then turns to hear the dogs barking. The wind starts whipping from a neighboring cliff and the dogs start whimpering. Every wildling and Crow slowly turns to the source of the noise.\n\nEXT. HARDHOME - GATE\n\nLOBODA: Shut the gate.\n\nMen hurry towards the gate to board it up. More howling from the distance. The Wildlings on the other side of the gate begin charging the gate.\n\nLOBODA: Shut the gate!!\n\nMen rush to put a board in place to hold the gate shut.\n\nSHOUTING: Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!\n\nLoboda walks to the gate with his axe and peers through a small hole in the wall. There is a faint scream in the distance, then a wight charges at the hole in the wall.\n\nLOBODA: Ready your arrows!\n\nThe wights claw at the gate. Arrows are nocked and fired. A wight sticks his hand through the gate and Loboda chops it off.\n\nEXT. HARDHOME - SHORE\n\nThere is a mad rush towards the boats with many people jumping in the water to catch one.\n\nJON: Get in line! Get in line!\n\nEXT. HARDHOME - GATE\n\nA wight tries to climb the gate.\n\nINT. HARDHOME - CABIN\n\nWights crawl to the top of the cabin and jumps through the hole in the roof. The men prepare their weapons and the giant growls.\n\nEXT. HARDHOME - GATE\n\nOne wight tries to climb under the gate. A barrage of arrows flies at the wights trying to get through the wall. Most of them land. The wight crawls even further under the gate. The wights start making holes in the gate. A sword sticks through the gate coming close to Loboda on the gate. Loboda dodges the sword, looks down to see the wight crawling under the gate, and stomps its head in.\n\nEXT. HARDHOME - SHORE\n\nThe people continue to rush onto the boats with Jon, Tormund, and Karsi leading them.\n\nJON: Hold the line! Hold the line!\n\nNIGHT S WATCH BROTHER: Lord Commander!\n\nJON: Get them to the ship and come back for me!\n\nBROTHER: But you ll never make it--\n\nJON: Now!\n\nKarsi approaches Jon.\n\nJON: You should be on one of those boats.\n\nKARSI: So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you re not there ?\n\nJON: You have my word. I ve given orders.\n\nKARSI: Don t think you re gonna be there to enforce those orders !\n\nKarsi heads back to helping people onto the boats.\n\nTORMUND: If they get through, everyone dies !\n\nJON: Night s Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!\n\nJon, Tormund, Karsi, and the Night s Watch brothers charge from the shore to the gate.\n\nEXT. HARDHOME - SHORE\n\nThe wights have knocked a hole into the gate big enough to crawl out of. One breaks through, tears someone apart, and then is taken down. A group of wights storm through the same hole. Cut to an overhead that shows just how many wights are behind the gate.\n\nJon arrives at the gate. He pins a wight to the gate with Longclaw as Tormund and Karsi kill the wights that have already gotten through. The archers take out the wight Jon pinned to the gate, and then the men cover the hole the wights had been escaping from with a sled.\n\nFighting continues. A group of wights tear into a Crow. Loboda and Karsi continue to kill the wights.\n\nJon looks up through the mist and sees 4 White Walkers on horseback on the top of the cliff.\n\nJON: The Dragonglass!\n\nLOBODA: You re with me, lad! Now!\n\nJon and Loboda charge towards the cabin. Jon cuts a wight in half then kills another. The giant breaks through a wall in the cabin as the cabin starts to go down in flames. He shakes the wights off of his back, snapping some in half and stomping others into pieces. Jon and Loboda storm the cabin.\n\nINT. HARDHOME - CABIN\n\nThe entire cabin is on fire. A White Walker wielding a staff walks towards them through the fire.\n\nLOBODA: Get the glass.\n\nLoboda walks towards the White Walker as Jon scrambles towards the Dragonglass. Loboda misses with his axe twice, getting it caught in the wall. He pulls it out to parry in time, but the Walker s spear shatters his axe. The Walker plunges his spear through Loboda's stomach.\n\nJon reaches the glass but is thrown across the room by the Walker before he can pick it up, causing Longclaw to fly out of the cabin. Jon ducks from the Walker s swings with his spear, and runs out to grab another sword. The Walker swings and shatters the sword. He knocks Jon down again. Jon struggles, then gets up again, running to pick up Longclaw. He stumbles and drops the sword. The White Walker staggers towards him. Jon picks up Longclaw just in time to match the White Walker, and to both of their surprises, Longclaw stops the Walker s spear. The Walker deflects one blow from Jon, but then he swings and shatters the Walker into pieces.\n\nJon falls to the ground after the struggle. The Night s King watches him alone from the top of the cliff.\n\nEXT. HARDHOME - GATE\n\nTormund and Karsi continue to tear through wights. Karsi looks up, and sees a group of blue-eyed wight children staring at her. They do nothing for a moment, then charge at her, chewing and clawing her to death.\n\nCut to Jon crawling across the snow, coughing up blood. A man grabs him and Jon puts Longclaw to his neck. The man turns out to be Edd and they lower their weapons.\n\nJON: The Dragonglass!\n\nEDD: Fuck the glass! We re gonna die here.\n\nA screech comes from the top of the cliff. Hundreds of wights dive from the top of the cliff. They appear to have died for a brief moment after landing, but then wake up and charge at Jon and Edd.\n\nCut to Tormund continuing to hold the gate. The gate starts creaking then comes down. Tormund runs to the boat.\n\nThe giant starts roaring as the other gate comes down, swinging a fiery log. Jon, Tormund, and Edd sprint towards the boat with the giant clearing a path for them with the log. The Night s King continues to watch them from the top of the cliff.\n\nEXT. HARDHOME - SHORE\n\nJon, Tormund, and the Crow jump off the dock onto the boat.\n\nJON: Go! Go! Go!\n\nTORMUND: Wun Wun, to the sea.\n\nThe giant stays back, continuing to take out loads of wights by swinging his flaming log. He begins to walk towards the boat, ripping the wights hanging onto him off of his back and throwing them into the water to die.\n\nJON: Let s go now! Now!\n\nJon looks back to shore to see the Wights, along with a White Walker, killing the last surviving wildlings.\n\nSlowly, a figure walks to the end of the dock. The camera pans up to reveal the Night s King. He stares at Jon and Jon stares back. The Night s King turns his head to the carnage at the edge of the shore and then looks back to Jon. He slowly starts raising his arms.The dead wildlings twitch, then open their eyes to reveal blue. Karsii comes back to life, blue-eyed . They all start standing up, joining the army of the dead, and staring at Jon. Jon can do nothing but stare back at the Night s King back as the boat drifts away.\n\nEND EPISODE\n\n", "episode_49": "\n\nEXT. STANNIS  CAMP - NIGHT\n\nA man walks by each of the tents.\n\nINT. MELISANDRE S TENT\n\nMelisandre stares into the fire. She exits the tent.\n\nEXT. STANNIS  CAMP - NIGHT\n\nMelisandre surveys the camp. In the distance, a tent catches on fire. Men start screaming and rushing out of their tents. A burning horse runs by Melisandre.\n\nEXT. STANNIS  CAMP - MORNING\n\nDAVOS: A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--\n\nSTANNIS: Horses?\n\nDAVOS: We re still getting a count, but hundreds are dead.\n\nSTANNIS: 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?\n\nDAVOS: The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.\n\nSTANNIS: Put last night s guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them.\n\nDAVOS: Unless there s a thaw, we can t press forward to Winterfell, and we don t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black.\n\nSTANNIS: We re not returning to Castle Black.\n\nDAVOS: Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can t march forward, and we won t march back \n\nStannis looks to Melisandre and Selyse. Davos follows his gaze then looks back.\n\nSTANNIS: Have the dead horses butchered for meat.\n\nStannis walks over to Melisandre.\n\nEXT. THE WALL\n\nThe Hardhome survivors, led by Jon, Tormund, Tollett, and Wun-Wun, approach the wall. Alliser looks down at the group. Jon steps forward, Alliser stares for a moment, then--\n\nALLISER: Open the gates.\n\nThe lower gate is lifted.\n\nEXT. CASTLE BLACK\n\nThe Hardhome Wildlings are being escorted through Castle Black.\n\nJON: It was a failure.\n\nSAM: It wasn t.\n\nJON: I went to save them, I failed.\n\nSAM: You didn t fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else.\n\nJON: I don t think that fact s lost on them.\n\nCut to many men of the Night s Watch glaring at Jon, then Olly who exchanges a long look with Jon from the top of the stairs. Alliser walks down the steps to Jon.\n\nALLISER: You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed.\n\nINT. STANNIS  TENT\n\nStannis is studying his chessboard. There are 2 Baratheon pieces next to a sword and opposed to 2 Bolton pieces. Davos enters the tent.\n\nDAVOS: You sent for me, Your Grace.\n\nSTANNIS: Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I m sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I ll make sure the Night s Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes.\n\nDAVOS: Your Grace, you ve named me your Hand.\n\nSTANNIS: Yes.\n\nDAVOS: The King s Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war.\n\nSTANNIS: You re not abandoning me, you re obeying a command.\n\nDAVOS: A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.\n\nSTANNIS: And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn t name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don t come back empty handed.\n\nDAVOS: Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me.\n\nSTANNIS: My family stays with me.\n\nDAVOS: At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.\n\nSTANNIS: My family stays with me.\n\nEXT. STANNIS  CAMP\n\nThe men are shivering, waiting in line for food. Davos walks by.\n\nINT. SHIREEN S TENT\n\nShireen is reading one of her books. Davos enters.\n\nDAVOS: What s this one now?\n\nSHIREEN: \"The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling\" by Grand Maester Munkun.\n\nDAVOS: Well that sounds like a proper story.\n\nSHIREEN: Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection.\n\nDAVOS: But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield.\n\nSHIREEN: And burnt him to a crisp.\n\nDavos and Shireen share a laugh.\n\nDAVOS: Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess.\n\nDavos hands her a stag carved out of wood.\n\nDAVOS: Do you like it?\n\nSHIREEN: He s beautiful.\n\nShireen kisses him on the cheek.\n\nSHIREEN: Thank you.\n\nDAVOS: You re very welcome.\n\nSHIREEN: Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?\n\nDAVOS: Of course I will.\n\nSHIREEN: But why am I getting a present?\n\nDAVOS: Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. (beat) I ll be gone for a few days, Princess. I ll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I m back.\n\nSHIREEN: You ll just have to read it yourself.\n\nDavos kisses Shireen on her forehead then leaves. Shireen looks over the stag.\n\nINT. DORNE - PALACE\n\nJaime is escorted by Areo to Doran s room.\n\nJAIME: Prince Doran. (bows)\n\nDORAN: Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit.\n\nJAIME: Princess Myrcella.\n\nMYRCELLA: Uncle.\n\nJAIME: What a lovely dress.\n\nMYRCELLA: You don t like it?\n\nJAIME: You must be cold.\n\nMYRCELLA: Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.\n\nJAIME: Prince Trystane. How s your jaw?\n\nTRYSTANE: A fleabite.\n\nELLARIA: What are you doing in Dorne?\n\nJAIME: Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella.\n\nDORAN: And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.\n\nJAIME: We received a threatening message. The princess s necklace in the jaws of a viper.\n\nJaime looks at Ellaria.\n\nMYRCELLA (surprised): That necklace was stolen from my room.\n\nDoran looks at Ellaria. A servant sets down food and drink before Jaime.\n\nJAIME: Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.\n\nDORAN: We can t behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I ve seen war. I ve seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I ve seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don t want to lead my people into that hell.\n\nELLARIA: No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.\n\nDORAN: And that is precisely what we are doing. (raises glass) Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nEveryone drinks. Ellaria dumps her cup out on the floor and looks at Doran.\n\nDORAN: King Tommen insists on his sister s return to the capital?\n\nJAIME: I m afraid he does.\n\nDORAN: I cannot disobey my King s command. (Ellaria glares at Doran) She will return with you to King s Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand.\n\nJAIME: I accept.\n\nDORAN: One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council.\n\nJAIME: You have my word.\n\nELLARIA: The word of a Kingslayer.\n\nEllaria gets up and walks to Doran.\n\nELLARIA: No wonder you can t stand. You have no spine.\n\nEllaria tries to leave the room. Doran grabs her wrist.\n\nDORAN: You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won t.\n\nDoran lets go. Ellaria leaves the room.\n\nJAIME: May I inquire into the fate of my man?\n\nDORAN: Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King s Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?\n\nJAIME: He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it s me.\n\nDORAN: Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he s to rule one day. I ll let him decide.\n\nJaime looks to Trystane. Trystane considers.\n\nTRYSTANE: I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.\n\nJAIME: You re a good man.\n\nTRYSTANE: On one condition.\n\nINT. DORNE - CELL\n\nBronn is laying on the ground in his cell. Tyene and Nymeria are playing a game where one tries to slap the other s hand before they pull their hands away. Nymeria slaps Tyene.\n\nNYMERIA: Why do we play? I m better than you, I ll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don t think, I can t recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- (slaps) -- pain? That one hurt didn t it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister.\n\nTYENE: You re going to miss.\n\nNYMERIA: I never miss.\n\nTYENE: You will. You re thinking too much. Now you re nervous.  What if she s right? \n\nNymeria slaps at Tyene and Tyene gets out of the way in time.\n\nNYMERIA: Luck.\n\nTYENE: Now it s my turn.\n\nNYMERIA: You re too slow. You ve always been too slow.\n\nNymeria sticks her hands out and blows a kiss to Tyene. Tyene slaps her across the face then blows one back. They get in fighting stances as the guards arrive. They take Bronn out of his cell.\n\nBRONN: Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?\n\nAREO: You ll find out very soon.\n\nBronn starts leaving the prison.\n\nTYENE: Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?\n\nBRONN: The most beautiful woman in the world.\n\nTYENE: And that s the truth!\n\nNYMERIA: Slut.\n\nTyene laughs.\n\nINT. DORNE - PALACE\n\nAreo escorts Bronn into Doran s room.\n\nJAIME: Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.\n\nDORAN: : I didn t realize there were knights of the Blackwater.\n\nBRONN: Only the one.\n\nJAIME: I believe you ve already met Prince Trystane.\n\nBRONN: Prince. Sorry about the other day.\n\nJAIME: Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He s agreed to grant you your freedom.\n\nBRONN: I m glad to hear it. The pie looks good.\n\nJAIME: There was one condition.\n\nJaime nods to Areo. Areo elbows Bronn in the jaw, knocking him to the ground.\n\nDORAN: Perhaps some soup instead?\n\nEXT. BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR\n\nArya pushes her oyster cart through the street.\n\nARYA: Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--\n\nTwo shady looking men approach her.\n\nMAN: How much for your little clam?\n\nThey laugh and walk away. Arya looks down the street and sees the Thin Man, looking over another sailor s application.\n\nARYA: Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!\n\nArya stops her cart, inspects the vile Jaqen gave to her, and tucks it back in her pouch. She starts pushing the cart again and makes eye contact with the Thin Man.\n\nTHIN MAN (waving): Come on.\n\nArya stares off into the distance.\n\nTHIN MAN: Some oysters, girl! I m talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!\n\nArya looks to the dock, and sees Meryn Trant and Mace Tyrell being helped off the boat. A Iron Banker approaches him and Arya starts walking away from the Thin Man and towards them.\n\nBANKER: Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free.\n\nMACE: Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.\n\nBANKER: And how goes the harvest in the Reach?\n\nMACE: Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I ll be sure to send the Arbor s finest your way.\n\nBANKER: I m afraid I don t partake.\n\nArya studies the group, focuses in on Meryn, and begins following them with her cart.\n\nEXT. BRAAVOS - IRON BANK\n\nMACE: Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course.\n\nBANKER: I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.\n\nMACE: Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.\n\nMeryn and Arya exchange quick looks at each other.\n\nBANKER: Most unfortunate for the glovers.\n\nMACE: If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble.\n\nBANKER: We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.\n\nMACE: You are the world's best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.\n\nMace gestures to the Iron Bank and the camera cuts to it.\n\nEXT. IRON BANK - LATER\n\nArya is waiting on the steps of the building opposite the bank, eating her oysters. The men start walking out of the Bank.\n\nBANKER: I m afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.\n\nMACE: Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?\n\nBANKER: I don't have that gift.\n\nMACE: It's not a gift, it s a skill, anyone can learn it.  So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown \n\nINT. BRAAVOS - BROTHEL - DOORWAY\n\nMeryn Trant and his men walk through the doorway.\n\nMERYN: I thought that old shit would never stop singing.\n\nMAN: It wasn t bad, though.\n\nMERYN: The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king.\n\nThey arrive at a door.\n\nMERYN: This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos.\n\nMAN: You re buying?\n\nMERYN: Oh, I m buying. But I never was good at sharing.\n\nThey enter the brothel. Arya pulls up to the doorway with her cart and sees the men entering.\n\nINT. BROTHEL\n\nArya walks through the door with a tray of oysters. The brothel keeper stops her.\n\nBROTHEL KEEPER: Sell your fish somewhere else.\n\nPROSTITUTE: Oh let her in, Brusco, I m hungry. Come here, sweetness.\n\nThe brothel keeper gestures nods for Arya to go on. She walks to the prostitute and the man she s with.\n\nPROSTITUTE: They say oyster s get the juices flowing. We ll take half a dozen.\n\nARYA: Three coppers.\n\nArya begins cutting an oyster open.\n\nJOHN: Here s a silver because the lady likes you.\n\nThe man places a silver on her tray in exchange for the oysters. Arya turns and sees Trant s men being taken to a back room.\n\nINT. BROTHEL - BACK ROOM\n\nArya enters the room and peers through a divider to see a prostitute posing for Meryn.\n\nMERYN: Too old.\n\nHEAD PROSTITUTE: Brea.\n\nBrea poses for Meryn.\n\nMERYN: Too old.\n\nHEAD: I have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you.\n\nA younger, 20-something prostitute poses for Meryn.\n\nMERYN: Too old.\n\nThe people in the room share uneasy glances as they realize what he s asking for.\n\nMERYN: Do you have what I want or not?\n\nHEAD: Of course. Of course.\n\nOne of Trant s men crosses to the other side of the divider and confronts Arya.\n\nMAN: Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry.\n\nThe man drags her into the room.\n\nMAN: Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.\n\nMAN 2: I ll have one.\n\nMeryn stares at Arya.\n\nHEAD: Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!\n\nThe head prostitute brings in a child.\n\nMERYN: Good.\n\nThe head prostitute hands Meryn an hourglass. He hands it back.\n\nMERYN: I ll tell you when we re done.\n\nHe leads the girl towards a bedroom.\n\nMERYN: You ll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.\n\nHEAD: Of course.\n\nThe head prostitute realizes Arya is still standing there.\n\nHEAD: I ll have you whipped, girl! Go on!\n\nArya leaves the room, but takes one last glance at where Meryn is taking the girl.\n\nINT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE\n\nJaqen kneels next to a man at the fountain of the center of the room and offers him a drink from the fountain.\n\nMAN: Valaar morghulis.\n\nThe man takes a drink. Arya approaches Jaqen.\n\nJAQEN: And?\n\nARYA: The Thin Man wasn t hungry today.\n\nJAQEN: Perhaps that s why the man is thin.\n\nThe man drops to the ground, creating a thud off-screen.\n\nARYA: Tomorrow.\n\nJAQEN: Tomorrow.\n\nJAQEN: A girl has work to do.\n\nArya walks towards the man who is now collapsed on the ground.\n\nINT. DORNE - PALACE\n\nDoran is addressing Ellaria with Areo standing guard next to the three Sand Snakes.\n\nDORAN: Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die.\n\nShe kneels and kisses his ring, crying. Nymeria and Obara look disgusted, Tyene s face reveals less.\n\nDORAN: I believe in second chances. I don t believe in third chances.\n\nINT. DORNE - JAIME S ROOM\n\nJaime is writing a letter in his former cell that is now unlocked. Ellaria enters.\n\nELLARIA: You write like a 7 year old.\n\nJAIME: Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.\n\nELLARIA: He didn t try to make you pay?\n\nELLARIA: Then maybe he s changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you ll be bringing her daughter home\n\nJAIME: She will.\n\nELLARIA: You love her very much, don t you?\n\nJAIME: Of course, she s my niece.\n\nELLARIA: I wasn t talking about her.\n\nJaime looks up from his writing at Ellaria.\n\nELLARIA: You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen.  It s always changing, who we re supposed to love and who we re not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want.\n\nEllaria pauses, taking a walks around the room.\n\nELLARIA: I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.\n\nEllaria exits the room.\n\nINT. SHIREEN S TENT\n\nShireen plays with her stag figurine next to a fire and on top of her book. Stannis enters the tent.\n\nSHIREEN: Father. Aren t you cold?\n\nSTANNIS: No. What are you reading?\n\nSHIREEN: The Dance of Dragons.\n\nSTANNIS: What s it about?\n\nSHIREEN: It s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.\n\nSTANNIS:  The dance of dragons ? Why is that a dance?\n\nSHIREEN: That s just what they call it.\n\nSTANNIS: Doesn t make much sense.\n\nSHIREEN: I think it s poetic.\n\nSTANNIS: If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?\n\nSHIREEN: I wouldn t have chosen either. It s all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.\n\nSTANNIS: Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.\n\nSHIREEN: It s alright, father.\n\nSTANNIS: You don t even know what I m talking about.\n\nSHIREEN: It doesn t matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?\n\nSTANNIS: Yes there is.\n\nSHIREEN: Good, I want to. I m the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I m your daughter.\n\nThey hug.\n\nSTANNIS: Forgive me.\n\nEXT. STANNIS  CAMP\n\nShireen is flanked by guards as she walks towards a pyre, clutching the stag Davos gave her. When she arrives at the pyre Melisandre steps to the front.\n\nSHIREEN: Where s my father? I want to see my father.\n\nMELISANDRE: It will all be over soon, Princess.\n\nThe men drag her to the pyre and tie her up.\n\nSHIREEN: Where s my father? No you can t do this, father where are you?!\n\nStannis watches on from the crowd.\n\nSHIREEN: Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!\n\nSELYSE: It s what the Lord wants. It s a good thing. A great thing.\n\nMELISANDRE: The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way.\n\nSELYSE: If we don t act then we ll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice \n\nMELISANDRE: Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!\n\nSHIREEN: Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!\n\nSELYSE: I can t.\n\nSTANNIS: There s no other way. She has King s blood.\n\nMELISANDRE: Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!\n\nSHIREEN: Mother, don t do this please! Please help! Don t do this! Please, father! Mother, help!\n\nMelisandre lights the pyre. Selyse runs towards the pyre and is stopped by Stannis  men. Shireen burns as Melisandre, Selyse, and Stannis look on, Melisandre pleased, Selyse horrified, and Stannis conflicted.\n\nSELYSE: No...\n\nEXT. MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT\n\nDaenerys sits next to Missandei at the top of the pit, with an open seat between her and Tyrion at the end, and Daario standing behind them. Hizdahr takes the open seat.\n\nDAENERYS: Where have you been?\n\nHIZDAHR: Just making sure everything s in order.\n\nCamera pans through the fighting pit to reveal it is covered with House Targaryen sigils. An announcer steps to the middle of the pit and waves his arm to silence the crowd.\n\nANNOUNCER (Valyrian): Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!\n\nThe Announcer raises his hands and the crowd begins to roar. Cut to Daenerys  box - she and Missandei look disgusted, Daario looks impressed. Two gladiators enter the pit.\n\nANNOUNCER: My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph: the strong or the quick?\n\nQUICK: I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.\n\nSTRONG: I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.\n\nThey stand waiting in front of her. The crowd is silent.\n\nHIZDAHR: They re waiting for you. Clap your hands.\n\nDaenerys looks down at the two men. After a moment, and with a look of disgust on her face, she claps her hands. The crowd roars and they start fighting. After some parries, the Quick man slices at the Strong man s neck.\n\nDAARIO: That one, the smaller man, no question, that s where you should put your money.\n\nTYRION: The smaller man it is.\n\nDAENERYS: I m not putting my money anywhere.\n\nHIZDAHR: Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.\n\nDAARIO: People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. (looks at Hizdahr) He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.\n\nHIZDAHR: I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not.\n\nDAENERYS: Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?\n\nHizdahr is silent.\n\nDAARIO: Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn t get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here (he puts a dagger to his neck) or here (he puts the dagger to Hizdahr s neck). And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren t. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy.\n\nThe Strong man decapitates the Quick man with one quick stroke. Hizdahr smiles and Daario looks turns away angrily. Tyrion says nothing.\n\nHIZDAHR: You don t approve?\n\nTYRION: There s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.\n\nHIZDAHR: Fair enough, yet -- it s an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?\n\nTYRION: It s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.\n\nHIZDAHR: I m not talking about myself. I m talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.\n\nCut to pit workers carrying the decapitated head out of the pit, leaving a trail of blood behind.\n\nDAENERYS: That is greatness?\n\nHIZDAHR: That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.\n\nTYRION: My father would have liked you.\n\nANNOUNCER: We ask again: who will triumph?\n\nDAENERYS: One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.\n\nHIZDAHR: At your command?\n\nDAENERYS: If need be.\n\nANNOUNCER: A Meereenese champion?\n\nThe crowd applauds.\n\nHIZDAHR: How many people will die to make this happen?\n\nDAENERYS: If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.\n\nHIZDAHR (looks at pit): Those men think they re dying for a good reason.\n\nDAENERYS: Someone else s reason.\n\nHIZDAHR: So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don t know their own minds, but you do.\n\nTYRION: Well said, you re an eloquent man. Doesn t mean you re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.\n\nANNOUNCER: ...or a Westerosi Knight?!\n\nCrowd jeers.\n\nJORAH (O.S.): I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen.\n\nDaenerys stares at Jorah. They both hold back emotion.\n\nHIZDAHR: Your Grace--\n\nDAARIO: Shut your mouth.\n\nDaenerys claps. Jorah nods. They begin fighting, with Daenerys  eyes following Jorah. He takes a blow to the mouth, is knocked down and starts bleeding. He gets up, has his sword knocked away, and pulls out a dagger. He wrestles with the man trying to choke him, throws him off, then stabs him in the chest. He pulls the dagger out, looking at Daenerys, throws it away, and picks up his longsword.\n\nJorah squares off against a flashy fighter that just brutally stabbed another fighter through the back. He slices Jorah in the cheek. The other two fighters square off, with a heavily armored fighter wielding a spear killing his opponent. The crowd cheers.\n\nJorah s opponent slices Jorah s arm then knocks him over, knocking his sword out of his hand. He holds his blade to Jorah s throat. Both he and Jorah look to Daenerys.\n\nTYRION: You can end this.\n\nHIZDAHR: She cannot.\n\nTYRION: You can!\n\nThe fighter holds his blade to Jorah s throat. He is about to make a move when the other fighter comes over and stabs Jorah s opponent in the back, killing him. Jorah gets up and faces the final opponent. Jorah matches the spearman, is knocked over, but catches the spear before it reaches his throat. He gets back up and the two face off again. Jorah spins, somersaults, and stabs him through the stomach, killing him. He looks up to Daenerys.\n\nJorah reaches for his opponent s spear. He picks it up and hurls it towards Daenerys  seat. Daario rushes to protect Daenerys and everyone else gets out of the way. It connects with a Son of the Harpy.\n\nCut to the crowd. Many audience members have put on Sons of the Harpy masks.\n\nDAARIO: Protect your queen!\n\nThe Sons of the Harpy start slitting the throats of former slaves and Unsullied in the crowd. Unsullied guards and Daario surround Daenerys and Missandei, fighting off the Harpys. Hizdahr starts running towards Daenerys.\n\nHIZDAHR: Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--\n\nTwo Sons of the Harpy come up on Hizdahr from behind and stab him to death. They run at Daenerys. Daario takes one out, and Jorah comes up from the pit to take Hizdahr s spot and take out the other. He offers his hand to Daenerys and she takes it. He leads her down to the pit with Daario and the Unsullied, leaving Tyrion and Missandei.\n\nA Harpy comes towards Missandei. Tyrion comes from behind, pulls him to his knees, and slits his throat. He leads her down to the pit.\n\nTYRION: Stay close!\n\nSons of the Harpy have began to rush the pit. Unsullied fight them off as Daenerys, Daario, and Jorah head towards a side exit.\n\nJORAH: This way!\n\nThey run through the exit, but a door swings shut. A Son of the Harpy steps out and Jorah kills him.\n\nDAARIO: The other side, follow me!\n\nThey rush towards the other side and join up with Tyrion and Missandei.\n\nDAARIO: Protect your queen!\n\nJorah, Daario, and the Unsullied form a ring around Missandei, Daenerys, and Tyrion in the center of the pit. Sons of the Harpy begin to rush from the other exit they were heading towards. They surround the ring, testing out the outer ring before they begin rushing. A few make it past the outer ring but are killed by Daario. Missandei and Daenerys join hands and Daenerys closes her eyes.\n\nA roar is heard in the distance. All of the Harpys look up. Drogon appears, breathing fire and circling the pit. The Sons run away from Daenerys to the edge of the pit. One charges at her and Drogon rips him apart. He breathes fire on 4-5 of them at a time before a spear hits his back. 2 more spears connect and he starts slowing down.\n\nDAENERYS: Drogon!\n\nShe takes a spear from his neck. He roars at her, but then closes his mouth. She slowly reaches to touch his nose. More spears are thrown at him by Sons of the Harpy and he turns to them and roars. Daario continues to fight off every Harpy that comes near her.\n\nDaenerys climbs onto Drogon s back slowly.\n\nDAENERYS: Valahd..\n\nDrogon runs towards the Harpys, starts flapping and then takes off from the Pit. He flies past the Pyramid and into the sky as Tyrion, Jorah, Daario, and Missandei stare up at him.\n\nA dragon roars in the distance.\n\nEND EPISODE\n\n", "episode_40": "\n\nTitle: The Children[Jon Snow leaves the tunnel and walks out into the snow. Smoking dead bodies lie all around him. As he walks into the forest he becomes surrounded by Wildlings. He has entered the Wildling camp unarmed]\n\nMANCE: You're wearing a black cloak again.\n\nJON: I've been sent to negotiate with you.\n\n[Mance and Jon enter Mance's tent and take a seat]\n\nMANCE: It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was.\n\nJON: The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows.\n\nMANCE: All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?\n\nJON: She put three arrows in me when I escaped.\n\nMANCE: Did you see her again at Castle Black?\n\nJON: Yes.\n\nMANCE: And?\n\nJON: She's dead.\n\nMANCE: Your doing?\n\nJON: No.\n\nMANCE: We'll drink to her.\n\n[One of the Wildlings gets two cups and fills them with liquid. Jon looks at Mance]\n\nMANCE: Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last.\n\n[They pick up their cups]\n\nMANCE: Ygritte.\n\nJON: Ygritte.\n\n[They take a sip and Jon begins to cough]\n\nJON: That's not wine.\n\nMANCE: No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty.\n\nJON: He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.\n\nMANCE: He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.\n\nJON: Grenn came from a farm.\n\n[They lift their cups]\n\nMANCE: Mag and Grenn.\n\nJON: Grenn and Mag.\n\nMANCE: Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?\n\nJON: Turn your army around and go home.\n\nMANCE: You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?\n\nJON: I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.\n\nMANCE: I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black.\n\n[Jon looks over towards the knife. The Wildlings get their weapons ready]\n\nMANCE: Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?\n\n[A horn blows in the distance. Everyone scrambles, Mance draws a knife to Jon's neck]\n\nMANCE: You attacking us?\n\nJON: No, it's like you said, we don't have the men.\n\n[The Wildlings run around frantically. Men on horseback ride toward them]\n\nMANCE: Hold! To me. To me.\n\n[The horsemen continue toward the Wildlings, killing all in their path. The Wildlings fight back, clearly outnumbered]\n\nMANCE: Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.\n\n[Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth ride up toward Mance Rayder. They get off their horses. Mance disarms himself]\n\nSTANNIS: You're the king beyond the wall?\n\n[Mance nods]\n\nSTANNIS: You know who I am?\n\nMANCE: Never had the pleasure.\n\nDAVOS: This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms.\n\nMANCE: We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.\n\nSTANNIS: It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.\n\nMANCE: We do not kneel.\n\nSTANNIS: I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king.\n\nMANCE: All the same, we do not kneel.\n\nSTANNIS: Take these men away.\n\nDAVOS: What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?\n\nJON: I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.\n\nDAVOS: You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.\n\nJON: I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son.\n\nSTANNIS: Your father was an honorable man.\n\nJON: He was, your grace.\n\nSTANNIS: What do you think he'd have done with him?\n\nJON: I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.\n\nSTANNIS: Very well. *to Davos* Take him.\n\nJON: Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them.\n\nCUT TO: KING'S LANDING\n\n[Qyburn is seen closely analyzing Gregor's body. He's in Pycelle's lab with Cersei]\n\nPYCELLE: I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.\n\nCERSEI: Bloody Martells.\n\nPYCELLE: The cause appears to be manticore venom.\n\nQYBURN: It is, yes, manticore.\n\nPYCELLE: I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done.\n\nQYBURN: Yes there is.\n\nPYCELLE: May I ask what you think you're doing?\n\nQYBURN: Saving him.\n\nPYCELLE: Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester.\n\nQYBURN: That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.\n\nPYCELLE: That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion.\n\nCERSEI: You're dismissed, Grand Maester.\n\nPYCELLE: Your grace. This is my laboratory!\n\nCERSEI: Not anymore.\n\n[Pycelle leaves the laboratory angrily as Qyburn tries to save Gregor's body]\n\nCERSEI: You can save him?\n\nQYBURN: Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance.\n\nCERSEI: Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.\n\nQYBURN: Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat.\n\nCERSEI: Will it weaken him?\n\nQYBURN: Oh no.\n\nCERSEI: Very well then.\n\n[Cersei leaves as Qyburn drains Gregor's blood. Cersei is seen arguing with Tywin]\n\nTYWIN: Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed.\n\nCERSEI: I'm opening it again.\n\nTYWIN: You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.\n\nCERSEI: I will not.\n\nTYWIN: Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.\n\nCERSEI: I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king.\n\nTYWIN: When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-\n\nCERSEI: I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.\n\nTYWIN: Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?\n\nCERSEI: When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away.\n\nTYWIN: No.\n\nCERSEI: Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.\n\nTYWIN: And how will you do that?\n\nCERSEI: I'll tell everyone the truth.\n\nTYWIN: And what truth would that be?\n\nCERSEI: You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known.\n\nTYWIN: Known what?\n\nCERSEI: Everything they say is true about Jaime and me.\n\nTYWIN: No, no, no, no, no.\n\nCERSEI: Your legacy is a lie.\n\nTYWIN: I don't believe you.\n\nCERSEI: Yes you do.\n\n[Cersei walks away, leaving Tywin standing there alone. Jaime is turning pages in a book in another room]\n\nCERSEI: Jaime.\n\nJAIME: You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?\n\nCERSEI: For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.\n\nJAIME: Tyrion is your family.\n\nCERSEI: He's not.\n\nJAIME: You don't get to choose.\n\nCERSEI: I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-\n\nJAIME: Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.\n\nCERSEI: A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?\n\nJAIME: The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-\n\n[Cersei kisses Jaime]\n\nCERSEI: I choose you.\n\nJAIME: Those are words.\n\nCERSEI: Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.\n\nJAIME: Told him what?\n\nCERSEI: I told him about us.\n\nJAIME: You told him?\n\nCERSEI: I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you.\n\nJAIME: You think he'll just accept that?\n\nCERSEI: Go and ask him.\n\n[Cersei kisses Jaime]\n\nJAIME: What did you say?\n\nCERSEI: I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters.\n\n[Cersei kisses Jaime's metal hand. Jaime pulls her close and kisses her]\n\nJAIME: Someone will walk in.\n\nCERSEI: I don't care.\n\n[Jaime picks Cersei up and lays her on the table as the start having sex.]\n\nCUT TO: MEREEN\n\n[Daenerys is sitting on her throne listening to her people's problems]\n\nMISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men. Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.\n\nFENNESZ: *in Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish.\n\nDAENERYS: You speak it very well.\n\nFENNESZ: Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much.\n\nDAENERYS: I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?\n\nFENNESZ: When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets.\n\nDAENERYS: I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.\n\nFENNESZ: I do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist.\n\nDAENERYS: My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you.\n\nFENNESZ: Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children.\n\nDAENERYS: What is it that you want from me?\n\nFENNESZ: Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.\n\nDAENERYS: You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?\n\nFENNESZ: Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-\n\nDAENERYS: I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.\n\nFENNESZ: Thank you, your grace. Thank you.\n\n[Fennesz leaves slowly]\n\nBARRISTAN: The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.\n\n[Another man enters the hall]\n\nDAENERYS: Approach my friend.\n\nMAN: *in Low Valyrian* I do not understand, my queen. I do not understand, my queen.\n\nMISSANDEI: *in Low Valyrian* The Queen says you may approach.\n\nMAN: *crying, speaking Low Valyrian*\n\nMISSANDEI: *translating* I have brought you. He came from the sky. The black one. The winged shadow. He came from the sky and...\n\n[The man kneels on the ground sobbing, laying a pile of burnt bones on the ground]\n\nMISSANDEI: *translating* My girl. My little girl.\n\n[The man continues to sob. In another room Daenerys is speaking with Missandei]\n\nDAENERYS: What was her name?\n\nMISSANDEI: Zala, your grace.\n\nDAENERYS: How old was she?\n\nMISSANDEI: Three.\n\nDAENERYS: Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?\n\nGREY WORM: *in Valyrian* Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my queen. Nothing since then.\n\nDAENERYS: *in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs.\n\n[The entrance to the catacombs is rolled open. Daenerys' dragons enter followed by Daenerys. Inside there is food for them. They chomp at the food as Daenerys puts a chain collar around their necks. She walks away crying as they screech at her. She turns around as the catacombs close with tears in her eyes.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK\n\n[Aemon and the rest of the Night's Watch burn the bodies of their fallen comrades]\n\nAEMON: They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west. They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names. It is for us to remember them. Our brothers, we shall never see their like again.\n\nALL TOGETHER: And now their watch is ended.\n\nAEMON: And now their watch is ended.\n\n[Aemon passes the torch around as each member of the Night's Watch helps burn the bodies. Stannis watches from above. Jon Snow and Melisandre share a look]\n\nTORMUND: Your old blind man patched me up. Why?\n\nJON: He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.\n\nTORMUND: You want me alive so you can torture me?\n\nJON: No one's going to torture you.\n\nTORMUND: So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?\n\nJON: I don't know what happens to the prisoners.\n\nTORMUND: Who decides?\n\nJON: I suppose Stannis does.\n\nTORMUND: He your king now?\n\nJON: I don't have a king.\n\nTORMUND: You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again.\n\nJON: We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?\n\nTORMUND: Words? What kind of words?\n\nJON: Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.\n\nTORMUND: Do what?\n\nJON: Say farewell.\n\nTORMUND: The dead can't hear us, boy.\n\n[Jon walks away]\n\nTORMUND: Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.\n\nJON: She told you?\n\nTORMUND: No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?\n\n[Jon leaves and takes Ygritte's body out past The Wall. He burns her body in a pile of logs.\n\nCUT TO: BEYOND THE WALL\n\n[Hodor drags Bran through the snow followed by Jojen and Meera Reed]\n\nMEERA: We can stop, we can rest.\n\nJOJEN: We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.\n\n[Jojen falls to the ground]\n\nMEERA: We're not going to make it.\n\nJOJEN: We're already here.\n\nBRAN: Jojen. Jojen! Look, Jojen, look.\n\n[The group stands at the edge of a cliff. A large tree is seen  not too far off in the distance. They head toward it. As they walk a skeleton hand reaches up and drags Jojen to the ground. It starts pulling him backwards as Meera runs towards him]\n\nMEERA: JOJEN! Hold on!\n\nBRAN (to Hodor): Help them! Now!\n\nMEERA: Hold on to me!\n\n[More hands burst from the ground.]\n\nHODOR: Hodor...\n\nBRAN: Help them!\n\n[Skeleton warriors have now emerged from the ground. They attack Jojen, Meera and Hodor. A brawl ensues. One of them attacks Bran until his direwolf, Summer, fights it off. Bran then wargs into Hodor and starts fighting back.]\n\nJOJEN: Bran! Save yourself, now!\n\n[Meera defeats a skeleton warrior, only to see another repeatedly stabbing Jojen. Just as two skeletons close in on the warging Bran, they re destroyed by two fireballs, apparently controlled by a young girl.]\n\nGIRL: Come with me, Brandon Stark!\n\n[She looks at Meera and Jojen.]\nGIRL: He is lost. Come with me, or die with him.\n\n[JOJEN: Go with them.\n\nThe girl throws some more fireballs and the group move into a cave. When the skeletons try to follow, they explode.]\n\nGIRL: They cannot follow us. The power that moves them is powerless here.\n\nBRAN: Who are you?\n\nGIRL: The First Men called us The Children, but we were born long before them. Come, he waits for you.\n\n[They enter a room filled with tree roots. An old man is seated in the center. Bran approaches him.]\n\nBRAN: You re the three-eyed raven.\n\nOLD MAN: I have been many things. Now, I am what you see.\n\nMEERA: My brother, he led us to you, and now he \n\nOLD MAN: He knew what would happen. From the moment he left, he knew, and he went anyway.\n\nMEERA: How do you know?\n\nOLD MAN: I ve been watching you. All of you, all of your lives, with a thousand eyes and one. Now you ve come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late.\n\nBRAN: I didn t want anyone to die for me.\n\nOLD MAN: He died so that you could find what you have lost.\n\nBRAN: You re going to help me walk again?\n\nOLD MAN: You ll never walk again. But you will fly.\n\nCUT TO: THE RIVERLANDS\n\n[Brienne and Podrick wake up in the open air on their way to the Eyrie.]\n\nBRIENNE: Podrick. Podrick! Where are the horses?\n\nPODRICK: I hobbled them last night.\n\nBRIENNE: What sort of hobble?\n\nPODRICK: A figure-eight, like you taught me.\n\nBRIENNE: If you did it like I taught you then the horses would be here.\n\nPODRICK: Thieves, maybe?\n\nBRIENNE: It s at least thirty miles to the Eyrie from here. You re carrying the saddle bags.\n\n[Brienne sees Arya Stark practising her river-dancing.]\n\nARYA: People coming. You can shit later, there s people coming!\n\nBRIENNE: Morning!\n\nARYA: Morning.\n\nBRIENNE: I like your sword. Are we getting close to the bloody gate?\n\nARYA: About ten more miles.\n\nBRIENNE: Did you hear that Podrick? Only about ten more miles to the Bloody Gate.\n\nARYA: Are you a knight?\n\nBRIENNE: No.\n\nARYA: But you know how to use that sword.\n\nBRIENNE: I do.\n\nARYA: Does it have a name?\n\nBRIENNE:  Oathkeeper. \n\nARYA: Mine s  Needle. \n\nBRIENNE: Good name.\n\nARYA: Who taught you how to fight?\nBRIENNE: My father.\n\nARYA: Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.\n\nBRIENNE: Mine said the same. But I kept fighting the boys anyway. Kept losing. Finally my father said,  If you re going to do it, you might as well do it right. \n\n[Sandor  The Hound  Clegane emerges.]\n\nBRIENNE: Seven blessings. I m Brienne of Tarth, this is Podrick Payne.\n\nHOUND: You want something?\n\nPODRICK: That s Sandor Clegane- the Hound.\n\nBRIENNE: You re Arya Stark.\n\nHOUND: I asked if you wanted something.\n\nBRIENNE: I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.\n\nARYA: My mother s dead.\n\nBRIENNE: I know. I wish I could ve been there to protect her.\n\nARYA: You re not a northerner.\n\nBRIENNE: I know, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.\n\nARYA: Why didn t you?\n\nBRIENNE: She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King s Landing.\n\nHOUND: You re paid by the Lannisters. You re here for the bounty on me.\n\nBRIENNE: I m not paid by the Lannisters.\n\nHOUND: No? Fancy sword you ve got there. Where d you get it? I ve been looking at Lannister gold all my life. Go on, Brienne of fuckign Tarth, tell me that s not Lannister gold.\n\nBRIENNE: Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.\n\nARYA: The Bloody Gate s ten miles.\nBRIENNE: I swore to your mother by the Old Gods and the New \n\nARYA: I don t care what you swore!\n\nBRIENNE: Arya!\n\nHOUND: You heard the girl! She s not coming with you.\n\nBRIENNE: She is.\n\n[Brienne and The Hound both draw their swords.]\n\nHOUND: You re not a good listener. Valyrian steel-- I ve always wanted some Valyrian steel.\n\nBRIENNE: Come with me Arya. I ll take you to safety.\n\nHOUND: Safety?! Where the fuck s that? Her aunt in the Eyrie s dead. Her mother s dead, her father s dead, her brother s dead. Winterfell s a pile of rubble. There s no safety, you dumb bitch. If you don t know that by now, you re the wrong one to watch over her.\n\nBRIENNE: And that s what you re doing? Watching over her?\n\nHOUND: Aye, that s what I m doing.\n\n[They begin a swordfight. The Hound seems to have the upper hand but Brienne defends well and floors him.]\n\nBRIENNE: I have no wish to kill you Ser.\n\n[The Hound grabs Brienne s blade with his palms, shoves it to one side and punches her.]\n\nHOUND: I m not a knight.\n\n[They fight bare-handed, Brienne bites off The Hound's ear, then The Hound draws a knife, and Brienne grabs a rock. She pushes The Hound down a steep cliff.]\n\nBRIENNE: Arya! Arya! ARYA! Where is she?\n\nPODRICK: She was just here...\n\nBRIENNE: Why weren t you watching her?\n\nPODRICK: I was watching you I thought you migth need some help \n\nBRIENNE: Which way Pod? Which way did she go?\n\nPODRICK: Ah, I think that way.\n\nBRIENNE: Arya!\n\n[The camera moves to show us Arya hiding just above Brienne. She walks down to The Hound.]\n\nHOUND: You re still here? [Coughs] Big bitch saved you.\n\nARYA: I don t need saving.\n\nHOUND: No, not you. You re a real killer. With your water dancing, and your needle.\n\nARYA: You re gonna die?\n\nHOUND: Unless there s a Maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I m done. I d skin you alive for wine. [Arya offers water.] Fuck water! Killed by a woman. I bet you liked that. Go on, go after her. She ll help you. Going out alone, you won t last a day out there\n\nARYA: I ll last longer than you.\n\nHOUND: You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I m ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher s boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please don t kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher s boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister. I should ve taken her. That night the Blackwater burned, I should ve fucked her bloody. At least I d have one happy memory! Do I have to beg you? Do it. Do it.\n\n[Arya stands up, takes The Hound s coin purse, and walks away.]\n\nHOUND: Kill me. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!\n\nCUT TO: KING'S LANDING\n\n[We enter Tyrion s cell. The door opens.]\n\nTYRION: Oh, get on with it you son of a whore.\n\nJAIME: Is that any way to speak about our mother?\n\nTYRION: What re you doing?\n\nJAIME: What do you think I m doing? The galley s waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.\n\nTYRION: Who s helping you?\n\nJAIME: Varys.\n\nTYRION: Varys?\n\nJAIME: You have more friends than you thought.\n\n[They reach the end of the underground tunnel.]\n\nJAIME: There s a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open.\n\nTYRION: I suppose this is goodbye, then.\n\n[They hug.]\n\nJAIME: Farewell, little brother.\n\nTYRION: Jaime, thank you. For my life.\n\nJAIME: Quickly now.\n\n[Tyrion takes a torch and uses a trap door to enter a room. There is a woman sleeping on a double bed, and we see the booch of the Hand of the King.]\n\nWOMAN: Tywin  my lion...\n\n[We see that the woman is Shae. She grabs a knife, and she and Tyrion struggle. Tyrion eventually strangles her with the bedclothes, weeping.]\n\nTYRION: I m sorry. I m sorry.\n\n[Tyrion takes a crossbow from the wall and walks in on Tywin on the privy.]\n\nTYWIN: Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we ll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure \n\nTYRION: All my life, you ve wanted me dead.\n\nTYWIN: Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what s yours. I d never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I d never let Illyn Payne take your head. You re a Lannister. You re my son.\n\nTYRION: I loved her.\n\nTYWIN: Who?\n\nTYRION: Shae.\n\nTYWIN: Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow.\n\nTYRION: I murdered her. With my own hands.\n\nTYWIN: It doesn t matter.\n\nTYRION: It doesn t matter?\n\nTYWIN: She was a whore!\n\nTYRION: Say that word again.\n\nTYWIN: And what? You ll kill your own father in the privy? No. You re my son. Enough of this nonsense \n\nTYRION: I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn t poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?\n\nTYWIN: Enough. We ll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.\n\nTYRION: I can t go back there. She s in there.\n\nTYWIN: What, are you afraid of a dead whore?\n\n[Tyrion fires the crossbow at Tywin.]\n\nTYWIN: You shot me. You re no son of mine.\n\nTYRION: I am your son. I have always been your son.\n\n[Tyrion fires again.]\n\nVARYS: What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I ve brought you this far.\n\n[Varys loads Tyrion, in a transport container, onto a ship. He goes to walk back to King's Landing, but turns around and boards the ship himself]\n\nCUT TO: THE RIVERLANDS\n\n[We go back to Arya, alone. She rides her horse to a small port.]\n\nARYA: I want to see the captain.\n\nCAPTAIN: You re seeing him.\n\nARYA: I want to go north, to the wall.\n\nCAPTAIN: No you don t.\n\nARYA: I can pay.\n\nCAPTAIN: There is nothing in the north but ice and war and pirates.\n\nARYA: I wouldn t need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or \n\nCAPTAIN: I m not going north, child, we re going home.\n\nARYA: Where s home?\n\nCAPTAIN: The Free City of Braavos.\n\nARYA: Wait, I have something else.\n\nCAPTAIN: More silver won t make a difference.\n\nARYA: It s not silver, it s iron.\n\n[Arya hands over the token she was given by Jaqen H'ghar.]\n\nARYA: Valar morghulis.\n\nCAPTAIN: How did you  valar dohaeris. Of course, you shall have a cabin.\n\n[We see Arya aboard the ship.]\n\n", "episode_41": "\n\nTITLE SEQUENCE\n\nEXT. WOODS\n\nA younger Cersei and her friend Melara are walking in the woods.\n\nMELARA: We shouldn t be out here alone.\n\nCERSEI: Why not?\n\nMELARA: If your father hears \n\nCERSEI: He ll never know we ve been gone.\n\nMELARA: But if he finds out \n\nCersei takes her hands.\n\nCERSEI: You don t need to be afraid of my father.\n\nThey walk until they see a hut with smoke coming out of it.\n\nMELARA: Are you sure?\n\nCERSEI: Yes.\n\nMELARA: We shouldn t go in.\n\nCERSEI: Of course we should.\n\nINT. MAGGY S HUT\n\nA fire is burning and various plants are hanging from the ceiling. They hear a shriek then \n\nMAGGY: Get out. Get out!\n\nMELARA: Let s go \n\nCERSEI: No.\n\nMAGGY: Listen to your friend.\n\nCERSEI: They said that you were terrifying. With cat s teeth and three eyes. You re not terrifying. You re boring.\n\nMAGGY: You don t know what I am.\n\nCERSEI: I know you re a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.\n\nMAGGY: Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.\n\nCERSEI: This is my father s land. My land. Tell me my future or I ll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.\n\nMaggy chuckles then hands Cersei a knife.\n\nMAGGY: Your blood. Give me a taste.\n\nCersei cuts her thumb then Maggy grabs her hand to suck her blood.\n\nMAGGY: Three questions you get. You won t like the answers.\n\nCERSEI: I ve been promised to the prince. When will we marry?\n\nMAGGY: You ll never wed the prince. You ll wed the king.\n\nCERSEI: But I will be queen?\n\nMAGGY: Oh yes, you ll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear.\n\nCERSEI: Will the king and I have children?\n\nMAGGY: No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3.\n\nCERSEI: That doesn t make sense.\n\nMAGGY: Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.\n\nMaggy starts laughing. Cersei s thumb starts dripping blood.\n\nMELARA: Come on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei!\n\nCUT TO: CERSEI S FACE - KING S LANDING - MODERN DAY\n\nCersei gets out of a cart to a funeral procession outside of the Great Sept of Baelor. She walks to the top of the stairs.\n\nPRIEST: Your grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting.\n\nCERSEI: They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.\n\nPRIEST: But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here \n\nCersei starts walking away.\n\nPRIEST: From all seven kingdoms \n\nCERSEI: They will wait.\n\nINT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nTywin s body rests with hand-painted stones on top of his eyes. Jaime presides over the body. Cersei walks next to him.\n\nCERSEI: He never wanted you to be a King s Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body.\n\nJAIME: What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They re going to try to take it away, all of it.\n\nCERSEI: They?\n\nJAIME: All of them out there are enemies. They re waiting a night to make sure he s really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they ll set to work on tearing us apart.\n\nCERSEI: They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he s the enemy. I ve been telling you for years, you ve been defending him for years \n\nJAIME: This is exactly what they want.\n\nCERSEI: ...and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?\n\nNo response from Jaime.\n\nCERSEI: Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You re a man of action, aren t you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. (gestures towards Tywin) Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world.\n\nCersei kisses Tywin on the head then leaves.\n\nINT. CRATE - PENTOS\n\nWe see men working with rope, merchants carrying boxes, and trees through a hole in the crate. The crate is set down and opened up. Tyrion comes out with Varys standing over him.\n\nVARYS: Apologies.\n\nTYRION: I still don t see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.\n\nVARYS: I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that  fucking crate .\n\nTYRION: Do you know what it s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?\n\nVARYS: No. I only know what it s like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.\n\nTyrion looks around.\n\nTYRION: Pentos?\n\nVarys nods.\n\nVARYS: The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself.\n\nTyrion pours himself a cup of wine and drinks it.\n\nTYRION: Much better.\n\nVARYS: My lord?\n\nTYRION: I don t think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.\n\nVARYS: You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.\n\nTYRION: In a box. Why stop now?\n\nVARYS: Because we are talking about the future of our country.\n\nTyrion finishes his wine.\n\nTYRION: The future is shit. Just like the past.\n\nHe pukes up his wine and then pours himself another cup.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN\n\nThe giant bronze Harpy statue is pulled down from the top of the pyramid.\n\nEXT. BROTHEL - MEEREEN\n\nAn Unsullied soldier, White Rat, walks up to a prostitute and hands her a coin. She takes him into her room and starts undressing him.\n\nPROSTITUTE: You want the same? Same as always?\n\nShe undresses herself\n\nWHITE RAT: You  you don t have to.\n\nPROSTITUTE: Habit.\n\nShe puts her clothes back on and lays down next to him in bed, stroking his head and humming. A knife slits his throat. White Rat looks up and sees a member of the Sons of the Harpy holding the knife\n\nINT. GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN\n\nA golden Sons of the Harpy mask rests on the table.\n\nDAENERYS: Sons of the Harpy?\n\nBARRISTAN: Yes, your grace. They left it on the body.\n\nDAENERYS: They ve never killed before.\n\nBARRISTAN: It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance.\n\nDAENERYS: I didn t conquer them. Their own people did.\n\nMOSSADOR: They do not see us as people, Your Grace.\n\nDAENERYS: Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?\n\nGREY WORM: White Rat, your grace.\n\nDAENERYS: I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.\n\nBARRISTAN: The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.\n\nMOSSADOR: Make them very angry.\n\nDAENERYS: Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\nThe Unsullied are putting their armor on. Missandei walks up to Grey Worm.\n\nMISSANDEI: Torgo Nudho.\n\nGREY WORM: Missandei hin Naath.\n\nMISSANDEI: I wanted to speak with you.\n\nThe other Unsullied leave the room.\n\nGREY WORM: Why do you come?\n\nMISSANDEI: White Rat, the Unsullied who  I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen s brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?\n\nGREY WORM: I do not know. I must go.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK\n\nJon Snow is parrying with Olly. Jon puts his sword to Olly s neck.\n\nJON: Get your shield up.\n\nOLLY: It s too heavy.\n\nJON: If it wasn t heavy it wouldn t stop a sword, now get it up.\n\nJon knocks Olly into the ground then helps him up.\n\nJON: Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I ll ring your head like a bell.\n\nSam and Gilly are watching them parry from afar.\n\nGILLY: Shouldn t you be training, too?\n\nSAM: Well, I m hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they ve killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!\n\nSer Alliser walks by.\n\nALLISER: These men need a firm hand. Always have. They re poachers and thieves.\n\nHe gives Sam and Gilly a look.\n\nALLISER: Not soldiers.\n\nHe walks away.\n\nGILLY: That one hates me.\n\nSAM: If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander  he hates the wildlings.\n\nSam looks at Gilly s baby.\n\nSAM: All the wildlings.\n\nGILLY: Don t let them send us away.\n\nSAM: It s not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he s a good man. He s running against Ser Alliser--\n\nGILLY: Sam! Don t let them send us away.\n\nSAM: I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too.\n\nGILLY: You can t leave, they ll execute you.\n\nCut back to Jon and Olly parrying. Olly is on the offensive.\n\nJON: Good, good, pivot! Don t forget to pivot! Shield up!\n\nJon turns and sees Melisandre waiting.\n\nMELISANDRE: The king wants a word.\n\nINT. ELEVATOR - THE WALL\n\nJon looks uncomfortably at Melisandre.\n\nJON: You re not cold, my lady?\n\nMELISANDRE: Never. The Lord s fire lives within me, Jon Snow.\n\nShe takes his hand to her face.\n\nMELISANDRE: Feel.\n\nJon feels her face.\n\nMELISANDRE: Are you a virgin?\n\nJON: No.\n\nMELISANDRE: Good.\n\nEXT. THE WALL\n\nMELISANDRE: Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.\n\nJon bows to Stannis. Stannis motions for him to get up.\n\nSTANNIS: You know who rules at Winterfell now?\n\nJON: Roose Bolton.\n\nSTANNIS: The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark s heart. Don t you want to avenge him?\n\nJON: I want a great many things, your grace. But I m a sworn brother of the Night s Watch now.\n\nDAVOS: I ve been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.\n\nJON: They re good men.\n\nDAVOS: Many don t. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?\n\nJON: It s where she belonged.\n\nDAVOS: Some of the Night s Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.\n\nJON: They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn t make them monsters.\n\nSTANNIS: No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can t protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton s head on a spike. But if I m to take Winterfell I ll need more men.\n\nJON: The men of the Night s Watch are sworn to play no part--\n\nSTANNIS: I m not talking about the damn Night s Watch. I m talking about the wildlings.\n\nJON: Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?\n\nSTANNIS: If they swear to follow me, I ll pardon them. We ll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I ll declare them citizens of the realm. I ll give them land to live on.\n\nDAVOS: It s a fair offer. More than fair.\n\nSTANNIS: I ll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.\n\nJON: I don t think that s likely.\n\nSTANNIS: You admire him, don t you?\n\nJON: I respect him.\n\nSTANNIS: He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...\n\nJON: Your grace \n\nSTANNIS: ...or he burns.\n\nJON: How much time do I have?\n\nSTANNIS: Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow.\n\nCUT TO: THE VALE OF ARRYN\n\nSansa, Littlefinger, and Yohn Royce are watching Robin parry. He is being beaten badly.\n\nMASTER OF ARMS: Sword up! Attack, my lord! Attack! Don t cross your feet!\n\nYOHN ROYCE: My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one \n\nBAELISH: Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.\n\nROYCE: Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.\n\nSQUIRE: My lord. (hands Baelish a note)\n\nMASTER OF ARMS (O.S.): Sword up, my lord!\n\nBAELISH: Some boys develop more slowly. He s still young.\n\nROYCE: He s 13. Boys go to war at 13.\n\nBAELISH: He has other gifts.\n\nROYCE: Does he?\n\nBAELISH: The gift of a great name. Sometimes that s all one needs.\n\nHe offers his hand to Sansa and takes her away from the swordfight. Lord Royce follows.\n\nSANSA: Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you ve done for me.\n\nROYCE: I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady.\n\nBAELISH: I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin s skills will have improved immeasurably.\n\nROYCE: He ll be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises.\n\nCUT TO: COUNTRYSIDE\n\nPodrick sits down next to Brienne, who is sharpening her sword.\n\nPODRICK: Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We re a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--\n\nBRIENNE: Us? The only reason you re here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren t safe in the capital. You re hundreds of miles from King s Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You re safe.\n\nPODRICK: But I m you re squire.\n\nBRIENNE: Do you even know what a squire is?\n\nPODRICK: An attendant to a knight?\n\nBRIENNE: I m not a knight. That means you re not a squire.\n\nPODRICK: Well, where would I go?\n\nBRIENNE: I don t care, I m not your mother.\n\nPODRICK: You swore to find the Stark girls.\n\nBRIENNE: I found Arya. She didn t want my protection.\n\nPODRICK: Sansa still might.\n\nBRIENNE: Will you shut your mouth? I didn t ask for advice. I don t want anyone following me. I m not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.\n\nA horse and carriage rides by.\n\nINT. CARRIAGE\n\nSANSA: You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.\n\nBAELISH: I did.\n\nSANSA: But we re heading west.\n\nBAELISH: We are.\n\nSANSA: If he wanted to betray us, he already would have.\n\nBAELISH: Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he s not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?\n\nSANSA: No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?\n\nBaelish smiles.\n\nBAELISH: No. But I pay them well, and they ve seen what happens to men who disappoint me.\n\nSANSA: So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?\n\nBAELISH: So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can t get her hands on you.\n\nCUT TO: KING S LANDING\n\nClose-up on Cersei drinking wine while Loras talks in the background.\n\nLORAS: It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn t presume to claim to have known him as such \n\nCut to Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.\n\nLORAS: But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a  what a force to be reckoned with.\n\nCERSEI (sighs): Thank you so much for your kind words.\n\nCersei walks away and heads down the stairs.\n\nGRAND MAESTER PYRCELLE: Deepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy  I never trusted Varys. I often warned \n\nCersei walks away from him. A barefooted man in a robe walks up to Cersei.\n\nLANCEL LANNISTER: Your grace.\n\nCersei inspects him for a moment.\n\nCERSEI: Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.\n\nLANCEL: My deepest sympathies.\n\nKEVAN LANNISTER: I apologize for my son s appearance.\n\nCERSEI: Uncle, it s quite alright.\n\nLancel walks away.\n\nKEVAN: They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point  They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive.\n\nCERSEI: I m sure he ll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.\n\nKEVAN: Of course.\n\nCersei walks away, grabs a glass of wine, and heads to a room alone. Lancel greets her after some time.\n\nCERSEI: Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.\n\nLANCEL: It wasn t my wounds that needed healing.\n\nCERSEI: What can I do for you?\n\nLANCEL: You can forgive me.\n\nCERSEI: What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?\n\nLANCEL: I led you into the darkness.\n\nCERSEI: I doubt you ve ever led anyone anywhere.\n\nLANCEL: I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine.\n\nCERSEI: I don t know what you re talking about.\n\nLANCEL: I m a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy  or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father s soul.\n\nCersei laughs.\n\nCERSEI: The day Tywin Lannister s soul needs your help \n\nCersei takes a sip of wine and Lancel walks away.\n\nCUT TO: LORAS  BEDROOM\n\nClose-up of Loras' birth mark.\n\nOLYVAR: It looks like Dorne.\n\nLORAS: No it doesn t.\n\nOLYVAR: It does. That s the Sunspear bit right there. And that s where the mountains are. And over here is  Sunsnake? Stonespear?\n\nLORAS: Sandstone.\n\nOLYVAR: Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there.\n\nLORAS: Fine.\n\nThey start kissing.\n\nLORAS: It s Dorne.\n\nOLYVAR: We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.\n\nLORAS: Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here.\n\nThey kiss. Margaery walks in.\n\nMARGAERY: We re late for dinner as it is.\n\nLORAS: You re very respectful.\n\nMARGAERY: I m very hungry.\n\nShe closes the door.\n\nMARGAERY: What s your name?\n\nOLYVAR: Olyvar, my lady.\n\nMARGAERY: I m afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.\n\nOlyvar kisses Loras then leaves the room.\n\nMARGAERY: Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?\n\nLORAS: Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What s the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?\n\nMARGAERY: In any event  (throws Loras his clothes) you shouldn t keep your intended waiting.\n\nLORAS: My intended? Please. Tywin s dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.\n\nMARGAERY: Lucky you.\n\nLORAS: Unlucky you.\n\nMARGAERY: You think I want that woman married to my brother?\n\nLORAS: If she doesn t marry me, she doesn t go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King s Landing. Which means you re trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law.\n\nMARGAERY: Perhaps.\n\nLORAS: Perhaps?\n\nMARGAERY: Perhaps?\n\nCUT TO: PENTOS\n\nTyrion is standing on a balcony with a glass of wine. Varys approaches him.\n\nTYRION: Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers.\n\nVARYS: Imp, half-man.\n\nTyrion raises his glass.\n\nVARYS: There are faster ways to kill yourself.\n\nTYRION: Not for a coward.\n\nVARYS: You are many things, my friend, but not a coward.\n\nTYRION: You never told me why you set me free.\n\nVARYS: Your brother asked me to.\n\nTYRION: You could have said no.\n\nVARYS: Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.\n\nTYRION: Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You re not family, you owe me nothing.\n\nVARYS: I didn t do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nTYRION: A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nVARYS: I don t believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.\n\nTYRION: You re going to have to find another soldier. I m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.\n\nVARYS: You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work.\n\nTYRION: I m not well-suited for work.\n\nVARYS: I think you are. You have your father s instinct for politics, and you have compassion.\n\nTYRION: Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.\n\nVARYS: I never said you were perfect.\n\nTYRION: What is it you want exactly?\n\nVARYS: Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.\n\nTYRION: Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that s how they became powerful in the first place.\n\nVARYS: Perhaps. And perhaps we ve grown so used to horror we assume there s no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?\n\nTYRION: I will never sit on the Iron Throne.\n\nVARYS: No, you won t. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.\n\nTYRION: Good luck finding him.\n\nVARYS: Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio s palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.\n\nTYRION: Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?\n\nCUT TO: MEEREEN\n\nThe Unsullied march through the streets.\n\nDAARIO NAHARIS: When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven t been behaving themselves.\n\nINT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID\n\nHIZDAHR ZO LORAQ: The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review.\n\nDAENERYS: Good.\n\nHIZDAHR: They did ask for some concessions.\n\nDAENERYS: Concessions?\n\nHIZDAHR: Politics is the art of compromise, your grace.\n\nDAENERYS: I m not a politician. I m a queen.\n\nHIZDAHR: Forgive me. You re right, of course. Still, it s easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones.\n\nDAENERYS: I don t expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery.\n\nHIZDAHR: They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.\n\nDAENERYS: The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?\n\nHIZDAHR: In the new world that you ve brought to us, free men would fight free men.\n\nDaario takes out his sword and smiles at Daenerys.\n\nHIZDAHR: The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.\n\nDAENERYS: No fighting pits.\n\nHIZDAHR: Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.\n\nDAENERYS: I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.\n\nHIZDAHR: If you--\n\nDAENERYS: How many times must I say no before you understand?\n\nINT. GREAT PYRAMIND - BEDROOM\n\nDAENERYS: Whatever he wants from me he s not going to get it. If he really believes I m going to reopen the fighting pits \n\nDAARIO: You should reopen the fighting pits.\n\nDAENERYS: What?\n\nDAARIO: My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before.\n\nDAENERYS: Why?\n\nDAARIO: I was a bad child. I wasn t big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16.\n\nDAENERYS: You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you re defending the fighting pits?\n\nDAARIO: I m only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you.\n\nA long pause.\n\nDAARIO: You re the queen. Everyone s too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You ve made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they ll attack. Show your strength here, now.\n\nDAENERYS: That s why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.\n\nDAARIO (scoffs): Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You re not the Mother of Unsullied. You re the Mother of Dragons.\n\nDAENERYS: I don t want another child s bones dropped at my feet. No one s seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he s flown halfway across the world. I can t control them anymore.\n\nDAARIO: A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.\n\nINT. DRAGON PIT\n\nDaenerys walks into the room the dragons are being held. She hears chains rattling.\n\nDAENERYS: Viserion? Rhaegal?\n\nThe two fully grown dragons start snapping, screaming, and breathing fire at her.\n\nDAENERYS: Easy. Easy. Easy.\n\nThey keep breathing fire and roaring so she leaves the room, terrified.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK\n\nMembers of the Night s Watch are constructing a funeral pyre.\n\nINT. MANCE S CELL\n\nJon Snow enters the room.\n\nMANCE: So here we are.\n\nJON: Here we are.\n\nMANCE: When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting \n\nJON: This doesn t have to be our last meeting.\n\nMANCE: No, but it will be.\n\nJON: You know what Stannis wants?\n\nMANCE: He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I ll give him this much: he s bold.\n\nJON: Shouldn t a king be bold?\n\nMANCE: Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he ll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I ll never serve him.\n\nJON: You told me you weren t here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.\n\nMANCE: That s right. But I don t want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.\n\nJON: You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life s work uniting them. You didn t do it for power. You didn t do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they re north of the wall. Isn t their survival more important than your pride?\n\nMANCE: Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn t about that.\n\nJON: Then bend the knee and save your people.\n\nMANCE: They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that s all gone.\n\nJON: And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won t go out and rescue them because why? You re afraid of looking afraid.\n\nMANCE: Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?\n\nJON: They ll burn you alive.\n\nMANCE: Bad way to go. I ll be honest with you, I don t want to die. And burnt to death, I don t want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it s better than betraying everything I believe.\n\nJON: And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they ll sing songs about you.  You d rather burn than kneel. The great hero.  Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there s no one left to sing.\n\nMANCE: You re a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can t understand why I won t enlist my people in a foreigner s war, there s no point explaining.\n\nJon walks to the door, then turns around.\n\nJON: I think you re making a terrible mistake.\n\nMANCE: The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.\n\nJon nods then leaves the room.\n\nEXT.

Then he looks at Jon Snow.\n\nSTANNIS: Kneel and live.\n\nMANCE: This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.\n\nStannis nods. His men take Mance onto the burning funeral pyre and tie him to it. Melisandre walks to the front of the pyre.\n\nMELISANDRE: Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false.\n\nShe picks up a torch.\n\nMELISANDRE: Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness.\n\nShe lights the pyre. Mance starts panicking as the fire reaches his legs.

(pours ale and leaves table; goes to another table) Ale?\n\nCut to another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's\n\nSANSA: Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll.\n\nBAELISH: You are becoming an observant young lady.\n\nSANSA: My mother used to say, \"dark wings, dark words\".\n\nBAELISH: An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.\n\nSANSA: So it was good news.?\n\nBAELISH: My marriage proposal has been accepted.\n\nSANSA: I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.\n\nWAITRESS: Ale?\n\nSANSA: I'll have some.\n\nBack to Podrick and Brienne\n\nPODRICK: My lady!\n\nBRIENNE: What is it?\n\nPODRICK: Sansa Stark. (Brienne begins to turn around) Don't look!\n\nBRIENNE: You sure?\n\nPODRICK: She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.\n\nBRIENNE: Littlefinger?\n\nPODRICK: A bunch of knights with him.\n\nBRIENNE Bunch? What's a bunch? 100? 6? 20?\n\nPODRICK: 10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--\n\nBRIENNE: Ready the horses.\n\nPODRICK: We only have one horse.\n\nBRIENNE: Find more.\n\nPodrick gets up and leaves\n\nBAELISH: Do you like the taste?\n\nSANSA: I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?\n\nBAELISH: It gives some men courage.\n\nSANSA: Does it give you courage?\n\nBrienne shows up and Baelish's knights get in her way\n\nGUARD: That's far enough.\n\nBRIENNE: Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth.\n\nBAELISH: We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, \"You're a loyalty comes free of charge.\" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.\n\nBaelish gestures to the knights to welcome her; Brienne goes through and takes a knee in front of Sansa\n\nBRIENNE: Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new.\n\nBAELISH: Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. (Brienne gets up) You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?\n\nBRIENNE: I was.\n\nBAELISH: Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.\n\nBRIENNE: It was after Renly's murder.\n\nBAELISH: Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him.\n\nBRIENNE: I tried to save him.\n\nBAELISH: But you were accused.\n\nBRIENNE: By men who didn't see what happened.\n\nBAELISH: Then what did happen?\n\nBRIENNE: He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.\n\nBAELISH: A shadow? With a face? (scoffs) This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?\n\nBRIENNE: Why should you have any say in her affairs?\n\nBAELISH: Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders.\n\nBRIENNE: Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--\n\nSANSA: No.\n\nBRIENNE: Please, my lady. If I could explain--\n\nSANSA: I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.\n\nBRIENNE: Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.\n\nSANSA: And sometimes we do. You should leave.\n\nBAELISH: We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?\n\nBrienne walks away\n\nKNIGHT 1: He asked you to stay.\n\nBrienne elbows him in the face after Knight 1 and Knight 2 attempt to get in her way.

He tries to run after it, but stops.\n\nEnter knight, who sees Podrick. Podrick sees him and throws a rock at him and misses.\n\nKNIGHT: I guess that means you re unarmed.\n\nKnight pulls out his sword and races towards Podrick.\n\nBRIENNE: Down, Podrick, down!\n\nPodrick gets down. Brienne slices the knight off his horse before he can get to Podrick. Another knight on a horse rushes towards her, and she stabs him in the neck.\n\nBRIENNE: Podrick?\n\nPODRICK: Yes, my lady?\n\nBRIENNE: You can stand now.\n\nPODRICK: Yes, my lady. (stands) Sansa Stark?\n\nBRIENNE: Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We ll follow them.\n\nPODRICK: My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you re released from your vow.\n\nBRIENNE: I swore to their mother I d protect those girls.\n\nPODRICK: If they don t want your protection--\n\nBRIENNE: Do you think she s safe from Littlefinger?\n\nPODRICK: (pause) No, my lady.\n\nBRIENNE: Get your horse.\nINT.

You ve never been a father to her.\n\nJAIME: If I was the father to any of my children, they d be stoned in the streets.\n\nCERSEI: And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.\n\nJAIME: I ll make things better.\n\nCERSEI: You never made anything better.\n\nJAIME: I m going to Dorne.

That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?\n\nBronn has been skipping stones and ignoring her.\n\nLOLLYS: Don't they?\n\nBRONN: Don't who?\n\nLOLLYS: People eat pigeon pie in the capital.\n\nBronn puts his arm around her.\n\nBRONN: They certainly do, my dear.

When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older.\n\nBRONN: Oh.\n\nLOLLYS: She hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking.\n\nBRONN: You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.\n\nLOLLYS: She is.\n\nBRONN: I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another.\n\nThey stop walking.

Ellaria approaches Prince Doran, staring at the Water Gardens from his wheelchair.\n\nELLARIA: Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing.\n\nDORAN: Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder.\n\nELLARIA: Your brother--\n\nDORAN: You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.\n\nELLARIA: What will you do about his death.\n\nDORAN: I will bury him. I will mourn for him.\n\nELLARIA: You would have me go to war?\n\nDORAN: You would have me go to war?\n\nELLARIA: The whole country would have you go to war.\n\nDORAN: Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.\n\nELLARIA: The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.\n\nDoran says nothing. Cut back to Trystane and Myrcella in the Water Gardens.\n\nELLARIA: Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?\n\nLet me have her. Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time.\n\nDORAN: I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.\n\nELLARIA: And how long will that be?\n\nEllaria exits the room. Areo goes back to guarding the door. Doran shakes his head.\n\nEXT. MEEREEN - STREET\n\nThe Unsullied march through the street.\n\nDAARIO (O.S.): The Unsullied are too conspicuous.\n\nDaario and Grey Worm are walking through an alley together.\n\nDAARIO: Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?\n\nGrey Worm grunts a \"no\".\n\nDAARIO: My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it...\n\nDaario has brought them to a door. Grey Worm knocks it in and rushes the room. He, Daario, and an Unsullied inspect the room quietly.\n\nGREY WORM: No one here. We go.\n\nDAARIO: In a hurry? You're afraid?\n\nGREY WORM: Unsullied fear nothing.\n\nDAARIO: Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide.\n\nDaario quickly pulls a dagger out, and stabs into a wall covered by a bookcase that immediately gives way. A man screams and falls out of the wall.\n\nDAARIO: Fear is useful that way.\n\nHe pats Grey Worm on the shoulder. The Unsullied soldier grabs the man. Grey Worm searches the hiding place and finds daggers laying on the ground with a Sons of the Harpy mask.\n\nINT. MEEREEN - PYRAMID\n\nMOSSADOR: Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.\n\nDAENERYS: It would send a message.\n\nBARRISTAN: I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace.\n\nDAENERYS: Why?\n\nBARRISTAN: For one thing, he may have valuable information.\n\nDAARIO: The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.\n\nBARRISTAN: How do you know that?\n\nDAARIO: Because I questioned him.\n\nHIZDAHR: And the information you did get, he is young and poor.\n\nMOSSADOR: He is born free.\n\nHIZDAHR: Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?\n\nDAENERYS: Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.\n\nMOSSADOR: They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.\n\nHIZDAHR: And how do you know this?\n\nMOSSADOR: Everyone knows this.\n\nHIZDAHR: I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family.\n\nBARRISTAN: We do not know what this man did or didn't do. (to Daenerys) Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way.\n\nMOSSADOR: I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial: these mean nothing to them. All they understand is blood!\n\nThey all look to Daenerys.\n\nDAENERYS: Thank you all for your counsel.\n\nEveryone gets up from the table and exits the room besides Ser Barristan.\n\nBARRISTAN: Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.\n\nDAENERYS: About what?\n\nBARRISTAN: About your father. About the Mad King.\n\nDAENERYS: The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.\n\nBARRISTAN: Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first.  Your enemies did not lie.\n\nDAENERYS: Go on.\n\nBARRISTAN: When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two.\n\nDAENERYS: I'm not my father.\n\nBARRISTAN: No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end.\n\nDAENERYS: I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.\n\nBARRISTAN (nods): Your Grace.\nINT. PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE\n\nTYRION: There's a bug.\n\nVARYS: Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food.\n\nTYRION: When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? (finishes his cup of wine) Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?\n\nVARYS: You don't like it?\n\nTYRION: I want to take a walk.\n\nVARYS: You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.\n\nTYRION: She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.\n\nVARYS: Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?\n\nTYRION: You're right. No point. (realizing) The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?\n\nVARYS: The road to Meereen.\n\nTYRION: And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?\n\nVARYS: I told you. A ruler.\n\nTYRION: We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.\n\nVARYS: You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand.\n\nTYRION: I didn't rule. I was a servant.\n\nVARYS: Still, a man of talent.\n\nTYRION: Managed to kill a lot of people.\n\nVARYS: Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well.\n\nTYRION: She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.\n\nVARYS: Why?\n\nTYRION: 'Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant. (takes a drink of wine)\n\nVARYS: People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.\n\nTYRION: I find us repulsive.\n\nVARYS: And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long.\n\nTYRION: You're right. Let's go for a walk.\n\nVARYS: No.\n\nTYRION: How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?\n\nINT. KING'S LANDING - QYBURN'S ROOM\n\nA dwarf head is placed on her desk.\n\nCERSEI: Not him.\n\nMERYN: Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?\n\nCERSEI: That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made.\n\nHUNTERS: Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you.\n\nCERSEI: Take the head.\n\nQYBURN: Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work.\n\nCERSEI: Very good.\n\nShe and Qyburn exit the room.\n\nQYBURN: Over there will be fine.\n\nMERYN (to hunters): You heard the man. Over there.\n\nThe hunters pick up the dwarf head.\n\nINT. KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP\n\nCersei and Qyburn enter the room, taking the open seats on the small council. Cersei sits at the head of the table.\n\nKEVAN: You're the Hand of the King?\n\nCERSEI: No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself.\n\nMACE TYRELL: Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--\n\nCERSEI: You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin.\n\nMACE: Oh, Your Grace.\n\nCERSEI: He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.\n\nMACE: The honor is all mine, Your Grace.\n\nPYCELLE: Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand.\n\nCERSEI: The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.\n\nPYCELLE: Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?\n\nCERSEI: The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have.\n\nPYCELLE: I must say I cannot see--\n\nCERSEI (cutting him off): Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title.\n\nKEVAN: That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.\n\nCERSEI: The king is very busy at this moment.\n\nKEVAN: He should be here, learning what it means to rule.\n\nCERSEI: He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf.\n\nKEVAN: I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. (looks to Qyburn) Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--\n\nCERSEI: My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.\n\nKEVAN: What mission?\n\nCERSEI: That is not your concern as Master of War.\n\nKEVAN: I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.\n\nKevan gets up from his seat.\n\nCERSEI: You would abandon your king in his time of need?\n\nKEVAN: If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock.\n\nHe exits the room and closes the door.\n\nINT. CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY\n\nShireen runs her finger over the letter \"S\" in her book.\n\nSHIREEN: Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.\n\nGILLY: Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!\n\nSHIREEN: Right, very good!\n\nSam is reading in a different aisle in the library.\n\nSAM: Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?\n\nGilly and Shireen look to him and then back at their book.\n\nGILLY: I know \"S\".\n\nSHIREEN: You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things.\n\nGILLY: Well, you're a wonderful teacher. (to Sam) Very patient!\n\nSAM: I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read.\n\nGILLY: That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.\n\nSam goes back to his book.\n\nGILLY (to Shireen): How old were you when you learned to read?\n\nSHIREEN: Three.\n\nSAM (interjecting): Three?! Who taught you, your mother?\n\nSHIREEN: No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because... (trails off)\n\nGILLY (gently): What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?\n\nSHIREEN: Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?\n\nGILLY: I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?\n\nSHIREEN: I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?\n\nGILLY: My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.\n\nSAM: Did you ever see them?\n\nGILLY: Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope.\n\nSHIREEN: What did he do to them in the woods?\n\nGilly is afraid to answer. Selyse enters the room before she can.\n\nSHIREEN: Mother.\n\nSELYSE (to Sam and Gilly): Leave us.\n\nSAM (nodding): Your Grace.\n\nSam and Gilly exit the room.\n\nSELYSE: You need to stay away from that girl.\n\nSHIREEN: Why?\n\nSELYSE: She's a wildling.\n\nSHIREEN: Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.\n\nSELYSE: She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.\n\nSHIREEN: Gilly wouldn't do that.\n\nSELYSE: You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.\n\nSelyse exits the library.\n\nINT. CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM\n\nSTANNIS: I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you.\n\nJON: With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive.\n\nSTANNIS: Who then? You?\n\nJON: No. Only one of their own.\n\nSTANNIS: Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?\n\nJON: The Lord Commander's niece.\n\nSTANNIS: Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response.\n\nJON: \"Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark.\" (Jon smiles)\n\nSTANNIS: That amuses you?\n\nJON: I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own.\n\nSTANNIS: I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.\n\nDAVOS: Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.\n\nJON: Most likely.\n\nDAVOS: Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?\n\nJON: Unpleasant, I expect.\n\nSTANNIS: Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.\n\nJON: I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you.\n\nSTANNIS: You can give me the North.\n\nJON: I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow.\n\nSTANNIS: Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell.\n\nJon stares at Stannis deeply without saying a word.\n\nINT. CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL\n\nSAM: He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?\n\nJON: It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again.\n\nSAM: You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.\n\nJON: I'm going to refuse him.\n\nSAM (confused): But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.\n\nJON: I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?\n\nJon walks away from Sam and takes a seat.\n\nALLISER (O.S.): Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.\n\nMaester Aemon rises slowly from the table at the front.\n\nAEMON: Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?\n\nJanos Slynt stands up.\n\nJANOS: Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings.\n\nMEN: Hear, hear.\n\nJANOS: He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.\n\nAlliser smiles. Men cheer and beat on the tables.\n\nAEMON: Is there anyone else?\n\nSHADOW TOWER BROTHER: Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better.\n\nMen, including Jon, bang their cups on the table, but the reaction is much weaker.\n\nAEMON: If there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--\n\nSAM: Maester Aemon.\n\nEvery Brother, including Jon, look to Sam at the back of the room in shock.\n\nAEMON: Samwell Tarly. Go on.\n\nJon shakes his head \"no\" at Sam.\n\nJANOS (O.S.): Sam the Slayer.\n\nThe whole room laughs.\n\nJANOS: Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?\n\nMore laughs.\n\nSAM: Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.\n\nThe men start laughing at Janos now.\n\nJANOS: Lies!\n\nSAM: A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making.\n\nStronger laughter. Maester Aemon cracks a smile.\n\nSAM: Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading.\n\nThe men go quiet.\n\nSAM: Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. (a man next to Sam nods) He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest.\n\nThe men give Jon a strong cheer.\n\nALLISER: I can't argue with any of that. (stands up) But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?\n\nJon doesn't respond. Maester Aemon rises again.\n\nAEMON: It is time.\n\nBrothers of the Night's Watch walk to the front of the room, placing their tokens into a jar. A brother breaks the jar and counts the tokens. Alliser and Jon have the same amount of tokens.\n\nBROTHER: It appears to be a tie, Maester.\n\nMaester Aemon rises once more, feels each stack of tokens to determine which is which, and casts his own vote for Jon. The men near Alliser look angry. The men grouped around Mallister are content. Everyone else cheers.\n\nBROTHERS: Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!\n\nJon rises, sees Alliser glaring at him, and lets out a small smile for the first time since he entered the room.\n\nEXT. BRAAVOS - STREETS\n\nArya creeps up on a pigeon in an alleyway and cuts its head off with Needle. She walks down the street with the pigeon in a pouch and Needle dangling from her hip. Three men walk by, see Needle, and approach her.\n\nMAN: You. You!\n\nArya stops and turns around to face them.\n\nMAN: What have you got there?\n\nArya doesn't respond.\n\nMAN: I said--\n\nARYA: Turn around and go. (pulls out Needle) Turn around and go.\n\nMan: That's a nice little sword. Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that. (pulls out his own sword)\n\nARYA: Nothing's worth anything to dead men.\n\nThe man approaches her with his sword, but then sees the Old Man from the House of Black and White walking towards the altercation and backs off.\n\nMEN: Quickly, go, go!\n\nThey flee. The man looks at Arya then begins walking away.\n\nEXT. BRAAVOS - THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE\n\nThe Old Man leads Arya back to the doorstep.\n\nARYA: Who are you? Why were they scared of you?\n\nOLD MAN: You lost this.\n\nHe tosses Arya her coin, then reaches to his face, pulls it off, and reveals the face of Jaqen H'ghar\n\nARYA: You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.\n\nJAQEN: There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.\n\nHe begins to head back inside the House of Black and White.\n\nARYA: Well who are you then?\n\nHe turns back around.\n\nJAQEN: No one. And that is who a girl must become.\n\nJaqen opens the door and waits for Arya. After a moment, she follows him into the House of Black and White. The door closes behind them.\n\nINT. MEEREEN - PRISON\n\nMossador is let into the Son of the Harpy's cell. The guards hold him up for Mossador.\n\nHARPY (Valyrian): She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her \"Mhysa\", she will never be your mother.\n\nMossador stares at him.\n\nEXT. MEEREEN - STREET - DAY\n\nThe Harpy is displayed in the street with his mask on, but the eye holes are cut out. A knife is in his stomach and skull, and \"Kill the Masters\" is written in blood on the wall next to the body.\n\nINT. MEEREEN - PALACE\n\nDAENERYS: Why?\n\nMOSSADOR (Valyrian): For you, Mhysa. (kneels) You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us.\n\nDAENERYS: He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right.\n\nMOSSADOR: He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.\n\nDAENERYS: There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.\n\nMOSSADOR: Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? (beat) When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived.\n\nDAENERYS: The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--\n\nMOSADOR: --and now you are the law!\n\nDAENERYS: The law is the law. Take him.\n\nTwo Unsullieds carry Mossador out of the room.\n\nEXT. MEEREEN - DAY\n\nThe Unsullied escort Daenerys and her small council. A large crowd surrounds them.\n\nCROWD: Mhysa! Myhsa!\n\nThey settle in front of the courthouse, surrounded by both former Masters and former slaves. The Unsullied form a ring around her.\n\nHIZDAHR (to Daario): She should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.\n\nDAARIO: Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.\n\nThe former slaves continues to yell to their Mhysa while the masters leer at her.\n\nDAENERYS (Valyrian, to crowd): You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other.\n\nMossador is carried into the scene by Unsullied and set before Daenerys on his knees.\n\nCROWD (Valyrian): Brother! Brother!\n\nMOSSADOR (Valyrian): Mhysa, please! Forgive me!\n\nDAENERYS (Valyrian): A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.\n\nCROWD (Valyrian): Mercy! Mercy!\n\nMossador looks to Daenerys, pleading. She looks to Daario and nods. He takes out his arakh, walks to Mossador, and puts it to his neck. The crowd starts protesting and the Masters look on uncertainly.\n\nMOSSADOR: Mhysa... (prays in Valyrian)\n\nThe crowd begs and pleads for mercy. Daenerys stares out to the crowd, then gives a nod to Daario, who swiftly decapitates Mossador.\n\nCROWD: Mhysa...\n\nThe crowd goes silent. Suddenly, they start hissing at Daenerys. The Unsullied brace themselves. A former slave throws a rock at a former Master, and the Unsullied attempt to hold back the fight. Barristan and Grey Worm escort Missandei and Daenerys away from the crowd. The Unsullied cover her with their shields.\n\nFormer slaves and masters begin killing each other in the streets. Rocks are thrown at the Unsullied shields in attempts to hit Daenerys.\n\nINT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID\n\nBARRISTAN: I'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace.\n\nGREY WORM: We all guard tonight.\n\nDAENERYS: Leave me.\n\nBarristan, Daario, Missandei, and Grey Worm leave the room. Daenerys hears a noise coming from outside, and goes out on her balcony to investigate.\n\nWhen she's out she hears a soft growl, and turns to see Drogon, perched on the top of the pyramid and close to fully grown.\n\nDAENERYS (shocked): Drogon...\n\nHe slowly climbs down to her balcony. Daenerys extends her hand. Drogon sniffs it hesitantly, and then takes off into the night, soaring over Meereen.\n\nEND EPISODE\n\n", "episode_43": "\n\nTITLE SEQUENCE\n\nCUT TO: BRAAVOS\n\nINT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE\n\nWater drips down a statue of a woman with her eyes closed. Two more statues are shown, a lion sitting in a throne, and a rams head. Behind a large heart surrounded by gold flames, a glowing fire can be seen. A statue of a knight is shown, then a statue of a king s face. A statue of a contorted tree is covered in a hair-like substance. There is a large pit filled with liquid in the center of the room. Arya can be heard, and then seen, sweeping. The waif carries a bucket past her. Sitting on the edge of the pit, Jaqen whisper to a man. Arya looks up and watches as Jaqen scoops up a cup of liquid from the pit, and hands it to the man. The man looks up at Jaqen, and hesitates before taking it.\n\nMAN: Valar morghulis.\n\nJAQEN: Valar dohaeris.\n\nThe man drinks the liquid, and watches as he approaches the statue of the woman with her eyes closed. He kneels down in front of it. Arya puts her broom down and approaches Jaqen.\n\nARYA: I've been sweeping this floor for days.\n\nJAQEN: Good.\n\nARYA: I didn't come here to sweep floors.\n\nJAQEN: No? Why come, then?\n\nARYA: You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.\n\nJAQEN: A man teaches a girl. (Stands up). Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. (Walks away).\n\nARYA: I want to serve. (Jaqen stops).\n\nJAQEN: A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one.\n\nARYA: Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.\n\nJAQEN: There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.\n\nJaqen leaves. Arya looks down at the man who had been kneeling. He is lying on his back, dead. Two men come into the room with a stretcher. They places the man s body on it and begin walking to an open door at the end of the room. The waif walks past Arya.\n\nARYA: Where are they taking him?\n\nThe waif doesn t respond, but continues walking. Arya turns to watch as the door closes behind the men carrying the stretcher.\n\nCUT TO: KING S LANDING\n\nEXT. STREET\n\nBells are ringing, and people are cheering and shouting. Many are on the sides of the road, waving as a number of carriages are carried past.\n\nBYSTANDERS: Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!\n\nInside her carriage, Cersei watches the people on the street, a sullen look on her face. She closes her curtains.\n\nINT. GREAT SEPT\n\nMARGAERY & TOMMEN: I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days.\n\nTommen and Margaery share a kiss. Cersei watches them from the crowd, emotionless. The newlyweds turn to the crowd, holding hands. Everyone claps. They smile and laugh. Cersei claps as well, and forces herself to smile.\n\nINT. TOMMEN S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT\n\nTommen breathes heavily as he and Margaery finish having sex. She turns onto her side and smiles.\n\nTOMMEN: Did I hurt you?\n\nMARGAERY: No. You were lovely.\n\nTOMMEN: It all happened so fast.\n\nMARGAERY: Yes. (Chuckles).\n\nTOMMEN: I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded\n\nMARGAERY: No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived.\n\nTOMMEN: This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life.\n\nMARGAERY: Wouldn't that be glorious? (They laugh. Tommen leans in to kiss her). Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?\n\nTOMMEN: Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?\n\nMARGAERY: No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.\n\nTOMMEN: King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?\n\nMARGAERY: So strange  Husband.\n\nTOMMEN: Wife. (They laugh). Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, (She chuckles), and it's all because my brother died.\n\nMARGAERY: I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty.\n\nTOMMEN: I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.\n\nMargaery looks at him curiously. He suddenly sits up.\n\nTOMMEN: Do you like to sail?\n\nMARGAERY: (Sits up). I love to sail.\n\nTOMMEN: I do, too.\n\nMARGAERY: I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.\n\nTOMMEN: I do, too.\n\nShe kisses him and turns around. She gets up, wrapping a bedsheet around herself as a cover.\n\nMARGAERY: Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?\n\nTOMMEN: I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.\n\nMARGAERY: It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. (Pours them some wine).\n\nTOMMEN: Well, but I'm a man now.\n\nMARGAERY: You are. And the king. (Hands him win). But you'll always be her baby-boy.\n\nTOMMEN: I suppose.\n\nMARGAERY: I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. (Sits down and begins to comb her hair). Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight.\n\nEXT. CASTLE WALL\n\nCersei and Tommen walk together, her arm around his. A group of guards walk behind them.\n\nCERSEI: You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters.\n\nTOMMEN: Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?\n\nCERSEI: There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.\n\nTOMMEN: That's where you grew up. (They stop). You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.\n\nCERSEI: (Chuckles). Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?\n\nTOMMEN: The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home.\n\nCERSEI: This is my real home now. Where my family lives.\n\nTOMMEN: I want you to be happy, mother.\n\nCERSEI: I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy.\n\nTOMMEN: But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?\n\nINT. ROOM\n\nCersei approaches a room with two guards. Inside, Margaery is having tea with some of her friends.\n\nMARGAERY: I said, \"Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?\" (Laugher). And he said, \"Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it.\"\n\nMargaery s friends laugh. As Cersei walks in, they all get up and bow.\n\nMARGAERY: Mother! (Gets up and hugs Cersei). Welcome.\n\nCERSEI: Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.\n\nMARGAERY: Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.\n\nCERSEI: No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you.\n\nMARGAERY: You are very sweet.\n\nCERSEI: Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.\n\nMARGAERY: I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.\n\nCERSEI: Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.\n\nMARGAERY: Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. (Margaery s friends laugh).\n\nCERSEI: I'll leave you to it then. (Turns to leave).\n\nMARGAERY: Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?\n\nCERSEI: There's no need for such formalities.\n\nMARGAERY: In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.\n\nCERSEI: Won t that be a lovely day.\n\nMARGAERY: Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.\n\nCERSEI: Remember. Anything you need.\n\nMargaery smiles. Cersei leaves. Margaery s smile fades. It returns when her friends begin laughing, and she turns back around. Cersei walks away with her two guards, still able to hear the laughter.\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL\n\nEXT. COURTYARD\n\nA horse whinnies. Bolton bannermen ride to the keep. In the keep, a number of workmen are busy building and repairing things. Some men carry some raven cages through the middle of the courtyard. Theon, carrying a dead bird, walks through for a moment. He then comes across some soldiers lifting up some flayed bodies with rope. He becomes very tense and forces himself to keep walking, head down. A raven picks at a body in a cart.\n\nINT. DINING HALL\n\nRoose and Ramsay sit at a table as Theon cuts some food. Ramsay talks with his face stuffed.\n\nROOSE: We can't hold the North with terror alone.\n\nRAMSAY: You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.\n\nROOSE: I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.\n\nRAMSAY: Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot.\n\nTheon holds the food in front of Ramsay. He takes some of it and puts it on his plate.\n\nROOSE: He left you no choice.\n\nRAMSAY: I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch.\n\nROOSE: And?\n\nRAMSAY: The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.\n\nROOSE: (After a moment). I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.\n\nRamsay, who had been heavily engrossed in his eating, stops suddenly and looks up. Theon slowly puts down a plate nearby. Ramsay puts down his silverware and sits back, looking at his father.\n\nROOSE: We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?\n\nRAMSAY: Our pact with the Lannisters protects -\n\nROOSE: I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. (Stands up). Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.\n\nCUT TO: MOAT CAILIN\n\nEXT. NEARBY HILLS\n\nSansa, Baelish, and a number of knights ride towards Moat Cailin. The party stops. Baelish leads Sansa on foot to a spot where they can easily overlook the keep. The keep is shown, surrounded by swampy riverlands.\n\nSANSA: That's Moat Cailin.\n\nBAELISH: Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before.\n\nSANSA: On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and  where are you taking me?\n\nBAELISH: Home.\n\nSANSA: The Boltons have Winterfell. (He nods). The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?\n\nBAELISH: (Shakes his head). No.\n\nSANSA: Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!\n\nBAELISH: He did.\n\nSANSA: He serves the Lannisters.\n\nBAELISH: For now.\n\nSANSA: I won't go.\n\nBAELISH: Winterfell is your home.\n\nSANSA: Not anymore.\n\nBAELISH: Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.\n\nSANSA: I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.\n\nBAELISH: You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -\n\nSANSA: No!\n\nBAELISH: Sansa -\n\nSANSA: No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.\n\nBAELISH: (Grabbing her). I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. (Quietly). You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them.\n\nHe kisses her forehead. He walks back to their horses. After a few moments, she regains her composure and gets on her horse. The party starts moving again. On top of a large hill nearby, Brienne and Podrick watch as the party arrives at the keep.\n\nPODRICK: How do we get through there?\n\nBRIENNE: We don't. We go around. (She turns her horse and begins leaving).\n\nPODRICK: It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.\n\nBRIENNE: Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.\n\nEXT. CAMPSITE\n\nPodrick sits scrubbing a boot.\n\nBRIENNE: Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?\n\nPODRICK: He hates that nickname.\n\nBRIENNE: Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?\n\nPodrick finishes scrubbing and hands the boot to Brienne. He puts the brush down. Brienne begins putting the boot on.\n\nPODRICK: I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.\n\nBRIENNE: He borrowed it?\n\nPODRICK: He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.\n\nBRIENNE: As punishment. For both of you.\n\nPODRICK: It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.\n\nBRIENNE: (Walks away to get firewood). Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.\n\nPODRICK: I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.\n\nBRIENNE: I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.\n\nPODRICK: If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.\n\nBRIENNE: You want to be a knight, Pod?\n\nPODRICK: Yes.\n\nBRIENNE: Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. (Sits down). And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.\n\nPODRICK: Thank you.\n\nBRIENNE: I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight.\n\nPODRICK: I suppose that's more important.\n\nPodrick leans over the campfire with some rocks. He strikes them together until he gets a spark, and blows until the fire starts going. He wipes himself off and stands up, walking over to Brienne. He begins taking her armor off.\n\nPODRICK: You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?\n\nBRIENNE: I was.\n\nPODRICK: Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.\n\nBRIENNE: He was.\n\nPODRICK: But how did you end up serving Renly?\n\nBRIENNE: (After a few moments). When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. (Pauses). And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. (Smiles). My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. (Her smile drops). Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me.  Brienne the Beauty , they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.  Don't let them see your tears,  he told me.  They re nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.  He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all.\n\nPODRICK: But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...\n\nBRIENNE: Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly.\n\nPODRICK: But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?\n\nBRIENNE: A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK\n\nINT. LORD COMMANDER S ROOM\n\nOlly opens the door for Stannis and Davos. Jon sits at his desk.\n\nSTANNIS: Lord Commander.\n\nJON: (Stands up). Your Grace.\n\nSTANNIS: (To Olly as he closes the door). I'd like to speak alone.\n\nJON: Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command.\n\nSTANNIS: Very well. (They all sit down). Have you considered my offer?\n\nJON: I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.\n\nSTANNIS: Say the word and you will be.\n\nJON: But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.\n\nSTANNIS: I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.\n\nJON: I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.\n\nSTANNIS: You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.\n\nJON: I can imagine no higher praise.\n\nSTANNIS: I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. (Stands up). But if your mind s made up, I won't try to persuade you.\n\nJON: May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?\n\nSTANNIS: Are you bored of us already?\n\nJON: You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.\n\nSTANNIS: I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.\n\nJON: And the wildlings?\n\nSTANNIS: They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. (After a moment). Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.\n\nJON: Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. (Olly stares at him).\n\nSTANNIS: You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.\n\nStannis begins to leave. Olly opens the door.\n\nSTANNIS: You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of  Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.\n\nJON: I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.\n\nSTANNIS: Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.\n\nStannis leaves. Davos begins to leave, but turns to Jon as Jon begins to pace.\n\nDAVOS: He sees something in you. (Jon looks up). Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you.\n\nJON: I'm sorry I disappointed him.\n\nDavos walks forward and takes a seat. Olly closes the door again.\n\nDAVOS: The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nJON: As long as he's ruling them.\n\nDAVOS: He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.\n\nJON: I ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nDAVOS: Have you now? (Turning to Olly). How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.\n\nOlly looks to Jon. Jon looks at him, crosses his arms, and nods.\n\nOLLY: Night gathers and now my watch begins -\n\nDAVOS: Not that bit, the bit at the end.\n\nOLLY: I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -\n\nDAVOS: Wait, that's enough.  The shield that guards the realm of men.  That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing.\n\nJON: And what needs to be done?\n\nDAVOS: As long as the Boltons rule the North, (Stands up), the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion.\n\nDavos nods and turns to leave. Olly opens the door for him. Jon sits at his desk and sighs.\n\nCUT TO: BRAAVOS\n\nINT. ARYA S ROOM\n\nArya lays on her bed, playing with her coin in her hand. Suddenly, the door opens, and she sits up. The waif enters with a cane, and begins pacing.\n\nARYA: What do you want?\n\nWAIF: Who are you?\n\nARYA: What?\n\nWAIF: You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. (Stops and walks to Arya). Who are you?\n\nARYA: (After a moment, perks up). No one.\n\nThe waif quickly swings her cane at Arya, hitting her arm. Arya, now on her feet, turns to face the waif, holding her arm in pain.\n\nARYA: Ow! Cunt!\n\nWAIF: A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?\n\nARYA: I told you, I'm no - (Gets hit again). Do that again and -\n\nThe waif hits her a third time, sending her to the ground.\n\nWAIF: Who are you?\n\nARYA: You're about to find out.\n\nArya reaches for her sword. Before she can pick it up, Jaqen appears.\n\nJAQEN: What are you doing?\n\nWAIF: We were only playing. The game of faces.\n\nJAQEN: A girl is not ready.\n\nWAIF: Clearly not.\n\nARYA: (Stands up). I am ready.\n\nJAQEN: For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.\n\nThe waif turns to her. Jaqen looks at the sword on Arya s bed.\n\nJAQEN: Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?\n\nThe waif, looking smug, leaves.\n\nEXT. DOCK\n\nOn a dock near the house of Black and White, Arya wraps a rock in her clothes. She is wearing new clothes, similar to the ones the waif wears. She ties them up and drops them into the water, the rock causing them to sink. She picks up her coin purse and throws it in the water. After a moment of examining her original coin in her hand, she throws it in the water as well. She looks at her sword Needle for a moment, and then picks it up. She prepares to throw it in the sea, but finds herself unable to, and begins to sob. She turns and walks over to some nearby rocks, and hides the sword under some of them.\n\nINT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE\n\nArya is again sweeping the floor in the main room. She notices the men from the beginning of the episode carrying another dead body into the back room. However, after a moment, she realizes that she didn t hear the door close, and she looks up to find it wide open. Jaqen surprises her by suddenly putting his hand on her shoulder. He nods towards the door, and begins walking over to it. Arya follows him, leaving the broom outside. They go down a fire-lit tunnel. Jaqen opens the door at the end of the tunnel to reveal a chamber. Inside, the waif stands motionless next to a large stone slab. On it is the dead man. Jaqen leaves through the back door. After Jaqen closes the door, the waif begins to remove the dead man s clothes. She looks up at Arya, who walks over and begins to do so as well. The waif inspects his body. She wets a rag and begins cleaning off the man.\n\nARYA: What do we do with them after we wash them?\n\nThe waif only looks up and smiles lightly, making no other response. She goes back to washing him, and Arya wets a rag of her own to help.\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL\n\nEXT. COURTYARD\n\nMAN: Open gates!\n\nThe gates are opened. Sansa, Baelish, and a number of knights on horseback gallop through. They stop. Theon watches from nearby through some metal bars, trembling. Baelish gets off of his horse. Roose, Ramsay, and Walda watch as Sansa gets off hers. Roose walks forward. Baelish leads Sansa towards him, rubbing her hands.\n\nROOSE: Lady Sansa, welcome.\n\nAfter a tense moment, Sansa smiles and curtsies.\n\nSANSA: (Smiles). Lord Bolton.\n\nROOSE: May I introduce my son, (Stands aside), Ramsay Bolton?\n\nRamsay smiles and walks forwards, removing his gloves. Sansa smiles at him.\n\nRAMSAY: It's an honor to meet you, my Lady.\n\nHe takes her hand and kisses it. Nearby, Myranda and other women watch.\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\nAn old servant woman leads Sansa down a hallway to her chambers. She opens the door.\n\nWOMAN: I'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash.\n\nSANSA: Thank you.\n\nWOMAN: Welcome home, Lady Stark. (Quieter) The North remembers.\n\nSansa watches as the woman leaves.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK\n\nINT. DINING HALL\n\nJon sits at a table, tapping his fingers anxiously. The men in the room talk amongst themselves.\n\nJON: Sam. (Sam looks up. Jon looks at Maester Aemon s chair). Maester Aemon?\n\nSAM: He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.\n\nJON: Take good care of him. (To the group). Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. (Laughter. Jon looks at Alliser). First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. (Laughter. After a moment, he continues). Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger.\n\nEveryone laughs. Some of the men jokingly pat Brian on his back, and Brian laughs as well.\n\nJON: Ser Alliser. (Silence). You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger.\n\nSome of the men shout in approval. Alliser looks up surprised. Edd and Sam look at each other. Janos pats him on the shoulder.\n\nJON: Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.\n\nJANOS: (Scoffs). Greyguard is a ruin.\n\nJON: Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -\n\nJANOS: I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.\n\nSome of the men begin talking loudly. Olly shifts in his seat.\n\nSAM: Alright, alright! Enough of that.\n\nJON: You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.\n\nJANOS: (Stands up, angrily shouts). I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!\n\nJON: Are you refusing to obey my order?\n\nThe men in the room all turn to look at Janos.\n\nJANOS: You can stick your order up your bastard arse.\n\nSome of the men whisper in shock. Janos looks pleased with himself. Alliser turns to Jon smugly.\n\nJON: Take Lord Janos outside.\n\nThe men begin to stand up. Janos scoffs.\n\nJON: Olly, bring me my sword.\n\nOlly turns quickly to Jon, then gets up. Janos looks more unsure of himself as more men get up. Alliser turns and looks at Janos disapprovingly. Edd walks over to get Janos. Alliser stands in his way for a moment. Jon looks at the confrontation, worried. Alliser raises his eyebrows for a moment and moves out of the way. Janos looks at him shocked. Edd grabs Janos, and some other men assist in dragging him outside.\n\nJANOS: You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! (Everyone moves outside). Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.\n\nSomeone puts a chopping block down. Janos is taken up to it.\n\nJANOS: A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!\n\nJon takes a final sip of his wine, gets up, and goes outside. The watchmen all gather in the courtyard. Olly hands Jon his sword. Jon walks up to where Janos is being held. Stannis watches from afar. Jon unsheathes his sword, and Janos looks up at it.\n\nJON: If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time.\n\nJANOS: (Trembling). I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! (Jon brings his sword up). My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid.\n\nJanos sobs for a few moments. Jon hesitates, and then brings his sword down, decapitating Janos. He hands his sword to a watchman standing nearby. He looks up and makes eye contact with Stannis.\n\nCUT TO: KING S LANDING\n\nINT. BROTHEL\n\nThe High Septon kneels in the center of a room. Seven prostitutes, dressed as each of the new gods, circle around him. Olyvar stands behind the High Septon, wearing a fake beard and holding a scale. The prostitutes giggle as the High Septon eyes them all.\n\nOLYVAR: You have served us well, my son.\n\nHIGH SEPTON: Thank you, Father.\n\nOLYVAR: Which of the Seven will you worship today?\n\nHIGH SEPTON: The Maiden.\n\nOLYVAR: Where is the Maiden?\n\nHIGH SEPTON: And the Stranger.\n\nOLYVAR: (Leaning forward). Two is extra, you realize?\n\nHIGH SEPTON: Yes, yes.\n\nOlyvar snaps his fingers. He and five of the prostitutes step aside. The two dressed as the Maiden and the Stranger remain and approach the High Septon, who smiles. Suddenly, some men led by Lancel Lannister barge into the room. The High Septon gasps and turns around.\n\nOLYVAR: What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -\n\nThe men force the High Septon to his feet. One of the men rips off Olyvar s fake beard, hits him to the ground, and begins kicking him. The prostitutes run out of the room.\n\nLANCEL: You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.\n\nHIGH SEPTON: I am the High Septon of the -\n\nLANCEL: (Grabs his neck). You are a sinner. And you shall be punished.\n\nThe men drag the High Septon out of the room. He is forced out into the street naked, and begin walking. He tries to cover his penis with his hands, but one of the men hits him with a stick. People gather on the sides of the street to watch, and begin chanting.\n\nCROWD: Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!\n\nMAN 1: Repent!\n\nCROWD: Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!\n\nMAN 2: Shame on you!\n\nCROWD: Sinner! Sinner!\n\nINT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER\n\nMace opens the door for the High Septon. He approaches the table. In better light, it is clear that his face is heavily bruised. Mace closes the door and walks over. The High Septon addresses each of the member present.\n\nHIGH SEPTON: (To Cersei) Your Grace, (To Pycelle), Grandmaester, (To Mace) Lord Tyrell, (To Qyburn), uh \n\nQYBURN: It doesn't matter. (Mace sits down).\n\nHIGH SEPTON: As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion.\n\nCERSEI: You were assaulted?\n\nHIGH SEPTON: I was, by those fanatics who call themselves  sparrows . They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive.\n\nQYBURN: I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.\n\nMACE: High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.\n\nHIGH SEPTON: I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.\n\nQYBURN: So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?\n\nPYCELLE: A man's private affairs ought to stay private!\n\nCERSEI: What do you want from us, High Septon?\n\nHIGH SEPTON: Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -\n\nCERSEI: And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?\n\nEXT. STREET\n\nA soldier helps Cersei out of her carriage. She begins walking forward. Ser Meryn stands ahead of her.\n\nMERYN: I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.\n\nCERSEI: Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. (To a man at the bottom of some stairs). Where can I find the High Sparrow?\n\nThe man points up the stairs. They are crowded with people. Cersei and Ser Meryn ascend them.\n\nMAN 1: Seven blessings.\n\nCersei covers her nose. At the top of the stairs is a large room. She watches as many people eat at tables.\n\nMAN 2: Thank you.\n\nMAN 3: Just a little more...\n\nWOMAN: Thank you ever so for the soup!\n\nIn the center of the room, an old man is giving soup to people in line. Cersei approaches him.\n\nCERSEI: A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. (Laughs). So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. (Prepares soup for the next person in line). The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me.\n\nWOMAN 2: Seven blessings to you.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. (Prepares soup for the next person in line).\n\nCERSEI: Why no shoes?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.\n\nCERSEI: Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so.\n\nCERSEI: (Smiles). Perhaps they're right.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon.\n\nCERSEI: An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade.\n\nCERSEI: The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.\n\nCERSEI: (After a moment). My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. (The High Sparrow looks up at her surprised). The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another.\n\nINT. QYBURN S LAB\n\nQyburn pulls a rat out of a cage. He brings it over to a desk and holds a knife above it. The camera switches to his face, and blood splatters onto a protective lens. Cersei enters the room with a letter.\n\nQYBURN: Your Grace.\n\nCERSEI: Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. (Hands him the letter).\n\nQYBURN: At once, Your Grace. (Walks to his desk).\n\nCERSEI: How's your work coming along?\n\nQYBURN: Very well.\n\nCERSEI: You've made progress?\n\nQYBURN: More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but \n\nCERSEI: Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word \"immediately\".\n\nCersei leaves the room. Qyburn begins writing something down. Behind him on a table is a large object, covered by a sheet. After a few moments of writing, the object begins violently jerking around, and then stops.\n\nQYBURN: Shh. Easy, friend.\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL\n\nCOURTYARD\n\nSansa walks through the busy courtyard. Theon is shoveling dirt nearby. He looks up to see her walking in his direction, and looks away, tense. On a platform above, Ramsay and Baelish stand, watching her.\n\nRAMSAY: She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.\n\nBAELISH: I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She s suffered enough.\n\nRAMSAY: I'll never hurt her. You have my word.\n\nBAELISH: I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go.\n\nRAMSAY: I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.\n\nROOSE: (Approaching). And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.\n\nRAMSAY: Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. (Bows).\n\nBAELISH: He seems pleased.\n\nROOSE: Shouldn't he be?\n\nBAELISH: (They begin walking). I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must.\n\nROOSE: I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue.\n\nBAELISH: Then I have delivered everything I've promised.\n\nROOSE: And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.\n\nBAELISH: The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.\n\nROOSE: The Queen will be enraged.\n\nBAELISH: Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.\n\nROOSE: And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. (They stop, and Roose holds up a letter). A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.\n\nBAELISH: A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken.\n\nROOSE: I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?\n\nBAELISH: Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.\n\nROOSE: I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?\n\nBAELISH: The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply.\n\nROOSE: I'd like to read the reply.\n\nRoose walks away.\n\nCUT TO: VOLANTIS\n\nINT. VARYS AND TYRION S CARRIAGE\n\nTyrion repeatedly opens and closes a window.\n\nTYRION: I have to get out of this wheelhouse.\n\nVARYS: Volantis is a large city.\n\nTYRION: I have to get out of this wheelhouse.\n\nVARYS: The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.\n\nTYRION: Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.\n\nVARYS: I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.\n\nTYRION: (Walks over to him). I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.\n\nVARYS: It's a perfectly good face.\n\nTYRION: I'm losing my mind.\n\nVARYS: If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that.\n\nTYRION: Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. (Pulls his hood up). What am I? (Varys shakes his head). One more drunk dwarf.\n\nTyrion knocks on the front of the carriage. The camera then pans over part of the city. Varys and Tyrion walk through a busy marketplace.\n\nTYRION: Slaves.\n\nVARYS: Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. (Shot of a man with a fly tattooed onto his cheek). Flies for dung shovelers. (Shot of a man with a hammer tattooed onto his cheek). Hammers for builders. (Shot of a man inspecting women with tears tattooed onto their cheeks). Tears for whores. Lest they forget.\n\nVarys and Tyrion arrive at a clearing in the market and stop. A woman speaks before a large crowd.\n\nPRIESTESS: (Valyrian) Lord cast your light upon us.\n\nCROWD: (Valyrian, in unison) Lord cast your light upon us.\n\nPRIESTESS: (Valyrian) For the night is dark and full of terrors.\n\nVARYS: (Aside) We should keep moving.\n\nNoticing Tyrion is no longer next to him, he frantically looks around.\n\nCROWD: (Valyrian, in unison) For the night is dark and full of terrors.\n\nPRIESTESS: (Valyrian) I was once as you are now.\n\nThe woman points to her cheek. Tyrion watches from some nearby steps, and drinks some wine.\n\nPRIESTESS: (Valyrian) Bought and sold, (Varys approaches Tyrion), scourged and branded...\n\nTYRION: The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.\n\nPRIESTESS: (Valyrian) The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...\n\nTYRION: Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. (Varys shushes him worriedly).\n\nPRIESTESS: (Valyrian) He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!\n\nTYRION: We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?\n\nThe priestess slowly turns her head to lock eyes with Tyrion.\n\nTYRION: (Covering his face). Come on. Let's find a brothel.\n\nThey return to the marketplace and continue walking. They stop at a large door, which a man is guarding. He rubs Tyrion s head.\n\nMAN: (Valyrian) It s good luck to rub a dwarf s head.\n\nTYRION: It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.\n\nVarys rolls his eyes, exasperated. The man stares at him unamused.\n\nINT. BROTHEL\n\nTYRION: See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust.\n\nElsewhere in the brothel, Jorah sets his cup down. Tyrion and Varys sit down at a table, and a woman comes to bring them wine.\n\nVARYS: Thank you.\n\nTyrion clinks his glass against Varys s. A prostitute dressed as Daenerys walks through the brothel. Tyrion looks at her.\n\nTYRION: Curious... hair. (She looks at him).\n\nMAN: (Across the room). The mother of dragons!\n\nHe gestures for her to come over. She approaches their table.\n\nTYRION: It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.\n\nJorah watches the prostitute, and then looks away.\n\nVARYS: Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.\n\nMAN: What makes you worth that much?\n\nBLONDE PROSTITUTE: I m magic. (They laugh).\n\nMAN: I bet you bloody are.\n\nJorah listens to this, appearing extremely uncomfortable.\n\nTYRION: Well, (Watches her kiss the man), she's taken.\n\nTyrion spots another prostitute, with shorter dark hair. He gets up.\n\nVARYS: Where're you going?\n\nTYRION: I need to speak to someone with hair.\n\nTyrion approaches the black haired prostitute.\n\nTYRION: Hello?\n\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Hello.\n\nTYRION: You've got no drink.\n\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: You've got no money.\n\nTYRION: Do I look like a man without money? (She looks at him incredulously). Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. (She laughs). But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? (Sits down). I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.\n\nThe blonde prostitute and the man giggle. Tyrion glances over at them.\n\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.\n\nTYRION: That s because they ve never met a queen.\n\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: You're just saying that.\n\nTYRION: You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.\n\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Why?\n\nTYRION: Because you have a skeptical mind.\n\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: (Smiles). Alright, then. I'm warning you. We re gonna have to wash you first.\n\nShe takes his hand, but Tyrion doesn t get up.\n\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Come on.\n\nTYRION: (After a moment). I'm, I'm sorry, I can't.\n\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Of course you can. You're shy.\n\nTYRION: I'm not.\n\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Have another drink.\n\nTYRION: Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I ll go for a piss, that s a start.\n\nShe looks confused. Tyrion walks away. Varys, noticing that Tyrion is no longer in his view, gets up worriedly.\n\nINT./EXT. WINDOW\n\nTyrion pisses out of a window, and sips his wine. He throws the cup out into the water below. He notices that someone is behind him.\n\nTYRION: No need to worry, I was just - (Turns to see it s not Varys, but Jorah). Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige.\n\nJorah looks behind him. As Tyrion pulls up his pants, Jorah puts a rope around him and begins tying it.\n\nTYRION: You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -\n\nJorah puts a rag over Tyrion s mouth.\n\nJORAH: I'm taking you to the Queen.\n\nTyrion s eyes widen. Jorah picks him up and leaves.\n\nEND EPISODE\n\n", "episode_44": "\n\nTITLE SEQUENCE\n\nEXT. BEACH\n\nA man hops out of his boat at night, and grabs a basket of fish. As he carries it on shore, Jorah knocks him out with a punch to the face. Looking around, he drags the man out of the water, and throws two coins on him. Jorah walks over to where he has Tyrion tied up. Tyrion is grunting, trying to cut the ropes binding him with a knife. Jorah picks up the knife and Tyrion. He throws Tyrion and his supplies into the boat, and then pushes it out to sea. Once it gains momentum, he hops in himself.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. BOAT\n\nA number of men walk around doing various tasks on deck. Jaime Lannister looks out from the side of the boat. He turns to the captain.\n\nJAIME: Is that Estermont?\n\nCAPTAIN: Tarth, Ser Jaime. (Shot of an island). The Sapphire Isle.\n\nINT. BELOW DECK\n\nA knife hits a sandbag.\n\nBRONN: Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?\n\nJAIME: This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night.\n\nBRONN: You ever been to Dorne?\n\nJAIME: No.\n\nBRONN: I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.\n\nJAIME: You should be happy to go back. (Drinks some water).\n\nBRONN: (Gets up, walking to his knife). There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. (Pulls out his knife from the sandbag). And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess.\n\nJAIME: We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,\n\nBRONN: (Incredulously) Your niece?\n\nJaime and Bronn have a stare-off. After a moment, Jaime looks away. Bronn drinks some water.\n\nBRONN: I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. (Sits down).\n\nJAIME: That's why you're here.\n\nBRONN: I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one.\n\nJAIME: Because I don't want to start a war.\n\nBRONN: That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.\n\nJAIME: It has to be me.\n\nBRONN: (Gets up starts walking). If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, (Grabs some rope and walks back), who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -\n\nJAIME: It has to be me.\n\nBRONN: (Sheaths his sword). You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that.\n\nJAIME: (Quietly) Varys set him free.\n\nBRONN: Well, if you ever see the little fucker, (Lays down), give him my regards.\n\nJAIME: He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards.\n\nCUT TO: KING S LANDING\n\nINT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER\n\nCersei sits in her chair, looking angry. At the table is Maester Pycelle, Qyburn, Mace Tyrell, and an empty chair.\n\nMACE: The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts. Given the expense of rebuilding the royal -\n\nCERSEI: How much can the Crown afford?\n\nMACE: With winter coming, half what they ask. Less.\n\nCERSEI: You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?\n\nMACE: Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter.\n\nMace smiles, as if expecting a laugh. Qyburn and Pycelle both look down. Mace s smile fades. Cersei smiles.\n\nCERSEI: You've already given us too much. (Gets up and walks to a window). No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.\n\nMACE: Absolutely.\n\nCERSEI: In person.\n\nMACE: (After a moment, looks at her surprised). Me? (Qyburn smiles).\n\nCERSEI: We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified.\n\nMACE: I will be honored, Your Grace.\n\nCERSEI: The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. (Smiling). He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.\n\nSer Meryn walks into the room. Mace turns to look at him, and then back at Cersei.\n\nMACE: My very own Kingsguard? Please express -\n\nCERSEI: Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.\n\nMACE: (Raises his hands). Of course, of course, (Gathers his belongings, and then gets up). I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.\n\nMace laughs. Qyburn looks down, lightly chuckling. Mace exits, followed by Ser Meryn.\n\nPYCELLE: The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.\n\nCERSEI: (Walking out). Not small enough.\n\nPycelle watches her leave.\n\nINT. HIGH SPARROW S CHAMBER\n\nA note lies on the desk, stamped with the seal of the High Sparrow. The High Sparrow sits behind his desk, across from Cersei. She pours a glass of wine.\n\nCERSEI: May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?\n\nHIGH SPARROW: No. (Smiles).\n\nCersei looks unsure, presumably having expected him to say yes. After a moment she smiles and pushes the wine away.\n\nCERSEI: The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. (Smiles).\n\nHIGH SPARROW: I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is, (Chuckles), I don't like the taste.\n\nCERSEI: Hmm.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: (After a moment). How may I serve?\n\nCERSEI: All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods.\n\nCERSEI: Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. (HS raises an eyebrow). In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago.\n\nCERSEI: If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.\n\nCERSEI: An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: An honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for.\n\nCERSEI: Which is why you were chosen. (HS smiles). You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: All sinners are equal before the Gods.\n\nCERSEI: (Smiles. Continues after a moment). What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.\n\nHIGH SPARROW: May the Father judge him justly. (Smiles).\n\nEXT. STREET\n\nA group of Faith Militant, wearing black robes and chains, walk down the street. Many nearby people chatter amongst themselves and look on. They begin breaking open casks of wine, and people begin screaming. One throws some men out of a building. Wine from the broken casks flows down some steps.\n\nINT. A ROOM\n\nWe see a man in pain, sweating heavily and biting down on a piece of cloth. Someone begins carving something on his forehead, and his hand scratches and grabs at the table.\n\nEXT. MARKETPLACE\n\nOutside, the Faith Militant destroy a marketplace, smashing things for sale, flipping over tables, and attacking merchants. One merchant, laying on the ground, looks up at some gold cloaks on a castle wall.\n\nMERCHANT: Help me! Help me!\n\nThe gold cloaks turn around, ignoring him.\n\nINT. A ROOM\n\nThe man in the room continues to sweat and bite down on the cloth. His face trembles. The symbol continues being carved.\n\nINT. BROTHEL\n\nA prostitute moans while having sex with a client. Some Faith Militant walk in and interrupt. She shrieks as one grabs her by the hair and pulls her off of the man. Another comes in grinning and strikes the man with a stick. The prostitute is forced out of the room. Some more men interrupt an orgy. Two women start screaming. They begin beating some of the participants, and taking others out of the room. Olyvar attempts to confront a member of the Faith Militant as the man drags out a prostitute.\n\nOLYVAR: (Angrily). This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.\n\nThe man elbows Olyvar in the face and continues on his way. After most of the Faith s Militant are gone, Olyvar hears a scream. He walks towards the source of the scream, blood running from his noise, and hears another scream.\n\nMILITANT: Cocksucker! (Man screams). Boy fucker! You barbaric filth! There's a special place in the Seventh Hell for your kind.\n\nOlyvar stands just outside the doorway of a large room. Inside, a group of militants, most of them armed, stand around a male prostitute and his male client. Both are naked and bloody on the floor.\n\nCLIENT: Please, please, I'll pay! I'll pay all of you.\n\nMILITANT: (Pulls out a knife). Yes, you will! Seize him.\n\nThe client begins crying. Olyvar backs out of the doorway and begins running away. The client screams.\n\nINT. A ROOM\n\nSomeone finishes carving the symbol on the man s head. The carver walks away and the man, revealed to be Lancel Lannister, sits up, breathing heavily. The symbol on his forehead is the symbol of the Faith Militant.\n\nEXT. STAIRWELL\n\nA number of Faith s Militant, all armed, walk down a stairwell. They enter a clearing, where Loras Tyrell is sparring with another man. Some people are spectating. The militants, including Lancel, approach the fight. Loras, having knocked the other man to the ground, removes his helmet. He hands his sword to another man, who hands Loras a drink. He suddenly becomes aware of the presence of the militants.\n\nMILITANT: Seize him.\n\nThe militants grab Loras.\n\nLORAS: Get your hands off of me.\n\nLANCEL: Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men.\n\nLORAS: Who do you think you are?\n\nLANCEL: Justice. (Loras grunts and struggles).\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\nMargaery walks down a hallway. She pushes a set of doors open, enters Tommen s chambers, and angrily puts her hands on a table. Tommen is eating, and looks up at her, surprised.\n\nMARGAERY: Why is my brother in a cell?\n\nTOMMEN: I, I don't know. I, I didn't order it.\n\nMARGAERY: We both know who did. (Walks away). You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.\n\nTOMMEN: (Standing up). Are you saying my mother is behind this?\n\nMARGAERY: She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.\n\nTOMMEN: Aren't you and mother getting along?\n\nMARGAERY: (Scoffs). Oh, my sweet, sweet King. (Sits down). Do you have any affection for me at all?\n\nTOMMEN: (Takes her hand). Of course I do. You're my Queen.\n\nMARGAERY: I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.\n\nTOMMEN: I'll set him free for you.\n\nMARGAERY: Do you promise?\n\nINT. CERSEI S CHAMBERS\n\nTommen walks into Cersei s chambers. Cersei is staring out of a window and drinking wine.\n\nTOMMEN: I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!\n\nCERSEI: (Turns around). Did I arrest him?\n\nTOMMEN: Well, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army.\n\nCERSEI: I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. (Begins walking towards her desk). Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions.\n\nTOMMEN: Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?\n\nCERSEI: I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy.\n\nEXT. THE GREAT SEPT\n\nA group of kingsguard lead Tommen to the Great Sept.\n\nKINGSGUARD: Halt!\n\nThe party stops. Tommen gets out and goes to the steps of the Sept on foot, followed by guards. A number of people are seen milling about around the base of the steps. Some Faith Militant stand guarding the steps. They block Tommen and his guards from walking up.\n\nMILITANT: His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.\n\nKINGSGUARD: Give the order and we'll tear out this rebel.\n\nTOMMEN: You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?\n\nKINGSGUARD: You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.\n\nThe kingsguard and militants both adjust their stances, ready for a fight. A number of other people begin to watch. Some people begin yelling at Tommen.\n\nMAN 1: Bastard!\n\nMAN 2: You're an abomination!\n\nMAN 3: You're born of sin!\n\nWOMAN: Filthy bastard!\n\nTOMMEN: We'll find another way.\n\nTommen begins walking away, followed by his guards.\n\nMAN 4: Abomination!\n\nINT. TOMMEN S CHAMBERS\n\nTommen opens the doors to his chambers, finding it empty.\n\nTOMMEN: My Queen?\n\nMargaery enters from outside.\n\nTOMMEN: There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.\n\nMARGAERY: You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.\n\nTOMMEN: I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.\n\nMARGAERY: Are you? When?\n\nTOMMEN: I--I don't know.\n\nMARGAERY: You don't know?\n\nTOMMEN: He was praying just now.\n\nMARGAERY: (Walking out). I have to send word to Grandmother.\n\nTOMMEN: Will you come back later? (Margaery stops).\n\nMARGAERY: I need to be with my family, Your Grace. (Continues walking).\n\nTOMMEN: Of course.\n\nCUT TO: THE WALL\n\nEXT. CASTLE BLACK\n\nSome Night s Watchmen spar in the courtyard. A number of others look on. Stannis and Selyse watch from some stairs.\n\nSELYSE: You think highly of this boy.\n\nJON: (To some of the men sparring). Good.\n\nSTANNIS: Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.\n\nSELYSE: A bastard by some tavern slut.\n\nSTANNIS: Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.\n\nSELYSE: I should have given you a son.\n\nSTANNIS: Not your fault.\n\nSELYSE: Whose then? (Looks at their daughter Shireen). I gave you nothing but weakness. (Turns back). And deformity. (Stannis shakes his head).\n\nMELISANDRE: (Walking towards them). Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.\n\nSELYSE: My Lady.\n\nMELISANDRE: Her father is the Lord's chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.\n\nMelisandre and Selyse stare at each other. After a moment, Selyse walks away.\n\nMELISANDRE: You march on Winterfell soon?\n\nSTANNIS: We must. To beat the snows.\n\nMELISANDRE: Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.\n\nSTANNIS: I won't. I need you.\n\nMELISANDRE: You only need faith, my King.\n\nSTANNIS: (Walking away). And you, my Lady, what do you need?\n\nMELISANDRE: To serve my Lord.\n\nStannis turns back. They both watch Jon sparring.\n\nINT. JON S CHAMBER\n\nJon sits at his desk. Sam hands him various letters to sign, one by one.\n\nSAM: Lord Ashford. (Jon signs). Lady Coalfield. (Jon signs). Lord Smallwood.\n\nJON: Never even heard of these people.\n\nSAM: They haven't heard of you either. (Jon signs). But we need men and they have some.\n\nJON: And how many men does this Lord Maison have to send us?\n\nSAM: (Chuckles, looking at the next letter). More than Lord Weebly.\n\nSam s face grows dark after reading the next letter. When Jon finishes signing the letter to Lord Weebly, Sam hands it to him, saying nothing. Jon begins signing, but hesitates.\n\nJON: Not him.\n\nSAM: I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North.\n\nJON: He murdered my brother.\n\nSAM: We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.\n\nJon hesitates another moment, and then relents and signs the letter. He leans his chair back, and Sam gathers up all of the signed letters. He walks away, almost bumping into Melisandre as she enters Jon s chambers.\n\nSAM: Apologies, my Lady.\n\nSam and Melisandre both look at Jon. Jon nods at Sam, and he leaves. Melisandre closes the door behind him, and Jon straightens up his posture.\n\nMELISANDRE: Lord Commander.\n\nJON: How can I help you?\n\nMELISANDRE: Come with us when we ride south. (Walks forwards). None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? (Turns to Jon).\n\nJON: Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nMELISANDRE: There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. (Walks in front of Jon).\n\nJON: You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions.\n\nMELISANDRE: No visions. No magic. Just life.\n\nShe opens up her robes, naked underneath. She leans back, and takes Jon s hand, slowly leading it up her body to cup her breast.\n\nMELISANDRE: Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it.\n\nMelisandre smiles and looks down at Jon s hand. Jon looks too. Realizing that she is no longer holding it there, he quickly pulls it away. Melisandre caresses Jon s face and sits on his lap.\n\nMELISANDRE: The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows.\n\nJON: I don't think Stannis would like that very much.\n\nMELISANDRE: Then we shouldn't tell him. (Starts unbuttoning Jon s coat).\n\nJON: I can't.\n\nMELISANDRE: Why?\n\nJON: I swore a vow. (Melisandre looks at him incredulously). I loved another.\n\nMELISANDRE: The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.\n\nJon keeps her from unbuttoning his coat any further, breathing heavily.\n\nJON: I know. But I still love her.\n\nMelisandre stands up, closes her robes, and walks away. After opening the door to leave, she turns to Jon.\n\nMELISANDRE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.\n\nJon s mouth opens a bit. She smirks and leaves.\n\nINT. STANNIS S ROOM\n\nStannis sits at his desk, reading something. There s a knock at the door. After a moment, Shireen enters. Stannis looks up at her and then back down at his reading material. She closes the door. She smiles, but after Stannis doesn t return her smile, she walks over to a nearby dresser and begins playing with the objects on top of it.\n\nSTANNIS: Are you lonely?\n\nSHIREEN: (Turns around, holding something). Just bored.\n\nSTANNIS: My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.\n\nSHIREEN: (Looks up). Were you bored a lot, too?\n\nSTANNIS: I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -\n\nSHIREEN: I like it. (Walks to a table). I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. (Picks up an X from the table).\n\nSTANNIS: Why do you say that?\n\nSHIREEN: She told me, \"I don't want to bring you.\"\n\nShireen fiddles with the objects in her hands. Stannis looks down.\n\nSTANNIS: She shouldn't have said that.\n\nShireen puts down the objects she was playing with, and turns to leave. Before opening the door, she turns back to Stannis.\n\nSHIREEN: Are you ashamed of me, father?\n\nStannis looks up surprised. He puts down what he was doing. Shireen looks down.\n\nSTANNIS: When you were an infant, (Stands up and walks around his desk), the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, (Shireen smiles), and you pressed it to your cheek. (Looks down. Shireen s smile drops). By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. (Walks to the table and adjusts the objects on it). I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. (Turns to her). Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. (Shireen smiles). I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. (Walks towards her). You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter.\n\nAfter a moment, Shireen hugs Stannis. At first hesitant, he hugs her back.\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL\n\nINT. TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL\n\nSansa lights a candle on a tomb. She then walks over to Lyanna s tomb and places a candle in the hand of Lyanna s statue. She then leans down to pick a dusty feather off of the ground. As she blows off the dust, a figure is seen approaching in the background.\n\nBAELISH: I thought I might find you here. (Sansa turns to him). Your Aunt Lyanna.\n\nSANSA: Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful.\n\nBAELISH: I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?\n\nSANSA: Yes, he chose her  and then he kidnapped her and raped her.\n\nBAELISH: Come. (Takes her arm). Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. (They begin walking away).\n\nSANSA: Dressed for riding?\n\nBAELISH: I am.\n\nSANSA: Where are you going?\n\nBAELISH: King's Landing.\n\nSANSA: King's Landing?\n\nBAELISH: Cersei sent for me. (They stop). We must not let her sniff out any trouble.\n\nSANSA: You can't leave me here!\n\nBAELISH: I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long.\n\nSANSA: How do you know?\n\nBAELISH: (They begin walking again). Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell.\n\nSANSA: You don't know that.\n\nBAELISH: I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.\n\nSANSA: You think he'll defeat the Boltons?\n\nBAELISH: He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. (They stop). As it happens, I am a betting man.\n\nSANSA: And if you're right?\n\nBAELISH: Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North.\n\nSANSA: But I, I wouldn't  Wardeness of the North\n\nBAELISH: You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.\n\nSANSA: What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?\n\nBAELISH: Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.\n\nSANSA: I don't know how to do that.\n\nBAELISH: Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.\n\nSANSA: His father frightens me.\n\nBAELISH: He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you ve learnt to maneuver from the very best. (Puts a hand on her shoulder). I return before too long. (Puts a hand behind her head). You'll be strong without me. (She nods, and he kisses her). The North will be yours. Do you believe me?\n\nSANSA: I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.\n\nBaelish chuckles and pats her shoulder. He turns and leaves as Sansa watches him.\n\nCUT TO: DORNE\n\nEXT. BOAT\n\nAt night, Bronn and Jaime sit in a boat. Bronn rows to shore alone. Looking across at Jaime, Jaime holds up his fake hand. Bronn begrudgingly goes back to rowing alone. After they get to shore, they carry their boat in, and hide it in some tall grass. They then both walk away.\n\nEXT. DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING\n\nJaime awakens to find Bronn standing over him with a knife. His eyes widens and he moves to the side as Bronn brings his knife down on a snake that was about to bite Jaime. Jaime looks at the snake and Bronn pulls his knife out of it.\n\nBRONN: Breakfast.\n\nBronn and Jaime sit at a fire. Bronn cooks the snake while Jaime puts gloves on.\n\nBRONN: That would have been a shit way to die.\n\nJAIME: As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.\n\nBRONN: Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.\n\nJAIME: I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.\n\nBRONN: No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me.\n\nJAIME: Sounds like all the rest.\n\nWhile Bronn is distracted eating, Jaime gets rid of his food.\n\nJAIME: What about you? What shit way would you choose?\n\nBRONN: In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune.\n\nJAIME: How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.\n\nBRONN: I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?\n\nJAIME: In the arms of the woman I love.\n\nBRONN: She want the same thing?\n\nJAIME: Let's go.\n\nThey both get up and gather their things. Bronn stomps out the fire. The scene cuts to them walking through some tall grass later.\n\nBRONN: The captain to that ship  What was he, Braavosi?\n\nJAIME: Pentoshi.\n\nBRONN: And he's headed to Oldtown?\n\nJAIME: As I said. Why?\n\nBRONN: What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?\n\nJAIME: A bag of gold.\n\nBRONN: I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.\n\nJAIME: It was a heavy bag.\n\nBRONN: And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.\n\nA horse neighs in the distance. Jaime looks around. A group of Dornish riders approach. Bronn and Jaime hide in the grass. Jaime watches the riders.\n\nBRONN: How many you count?\n\nJAIME: Four.\n\nBRONN: How many you think you can take?\n\nJAIME: One, if he's slow.\n\nBronn turns to look at the riders.\n\nRIDER: Halt!\n\nThe rider holds up his hand, and the party stops, having spotted Jaime and Bronn s footsteps.\n\nBRONN: Fucked in the arse. (Both get up). Hiya! (The riders approach them). Morning, lads. Glad we found you.\n\nRIDER: Who are you?\n\nBRONN: Cooper. (Points to Jaime). This is Darnell.\n\nRIDER: You're from King's Landing.\n\nBRONN: Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.\n\nRIDER: Why are you here?\n\nBRONN: Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really.\n\nJAIME: I thought the sharks would get us. (Bronn looks at him).\n\nRIDER: There are no sharks in Dorne.\n\nJAIME: I could have sworn those were shark fins.\n\nBRONN: Dolphins maybe.\n\nRIDER: Throw your swords in the sand.\n\nBRONN: Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home.\n\nRIDER: Swords in the sand! Now!\n\nBronn and Jaime look at each other. They pull out their swords. Bronn puts his down in the sand, and then flings a knife into the throat of a rider. He then kills another, stabbing him and knocking him off of his horse. A third charges him, and Bronn knocks him off of his horse as well. However, he survives. Bronn turns to Jaime.\n\nBRONN: That one should be slow enough.\n\nBronn approaches the fourth and final rider. Jaime turns to the injured rider, who is revealed to be much larger than Jaime. They begin fighting. In the background, Bronn knocks the fourth rider off of his horse. As Jaime and the man fight, Jaime is slowly pushed back, down a hill. He falls over and begins rolling to escape his attacker. He loses his balance and his sword is knocked away. As the attacker brings his sword down to kill Jaime, Jaime brings his gold hand up to block it. The sword gets stuck in Jaime s hand. As the attacker is stuck trying to remove the sword, Jaime picks his back up, kills him, and kicks him down the hill.\n\nBRONN: Nice move! (Jaime turns to him).\n\nJAIME: Luck.\n\nBRONN: You had a wonderful teacher.\n\nBronn turns and walks away. Jaime looks back down the hill, and then to his hand. Failing to shake the sword off, he is forced to dislodge it by kicking it out of his own hand. Bronn is then seen cleaning his sword off on the clothes of one of the dead riders. He sheaths his sword as Jaime approaches.\n\nBRONN: Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.\n\nJAIME: First we need to bury these bodies.\n\nBRONN: Birds have to eat too.\n\nJAIME: Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war.\n\nBRONN: Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?\n\nJAIME: (Holding out his hand). I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really.\n\nJaime walks away as Bronn s face drops. He begins dragging a body.\n\nEXT. BEACH\n\nElaria, in all black, swiftly rides down a beach on horseback. She approaches a tent. Nearby are some more horses, and in the tent are Nymeria, Obara, and Tyene. Tyene exits the tent to meet her as she dismounts.\n\nTYENE: Nama!\n\nTyene and Elaria embrace.\n\nELARIA: Nym, Obara.\n\nOBARA: Will it be war?\n\nELARIA: Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.\n\nOBARA: Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.\n\nELARIA: We don't need an army to start a war. (Drinks water). Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them.\n\nNYMERIA: We may have a problem.\n\nNymeria uses a whip to knock a bucket away. Underneath is the captain who brought Jaime and Bronn to Dorne, buried neck-deep in sand and covered in scorpions.\n\nOBARA: A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne.\n\nELARIA: He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war.\n\nTYENE: (Walks towards her). I'm with you. Always. (Elaria puts a hand to her face).\n\nELARIA: Nym? (Nymeria nods). Obara?\n\nOBARA: When I was a child, (Begins walking), Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl.\nOberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said, \"Girl or boy, we fight our battles. But the Gods let us choose our weapons.\" My father pointed to the spear, and then to my mother's tears.\n\nObara picks up a spear that was sticking out of the sand. She twirls it around for a moment, and then tosses it through the captain s head, killing him.\n\nOBARA: (Smiles). I made my choice long ago.\n\nElaria and Tyene smile.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. BOAT AT SEA\n\nJorah steers the boat as Tyrion, tied up and gagged, tries to speak. He only succeeds in mumbling. Eventually he stops trying to say real words, and instead only tries to be as loud as possible, to annoy Jorah. Jorah comes over and ungags him, and then walks back over to continue steering.\n\nTYRION: Thank you. (After a long pause). Who are you?\n\nJORAH: Your captor.\n\nTYRION: Do you have wine?\n\nJORAH: No.\n\nTYRION: I can't sleep without wine.\n\nJORAH: Then stay awake.\n\nTYRION: You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.\n\nJORAH: I'm not taking you to your sister.\n\nTYRION: You said you were taking me to the Queen.\n\nJORAH: I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.\n\nTYRION: (Chuckles). What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!\n\nJORAH: What business would you have with the Queen?\n\nTYRION: Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? (Holds out his hands expectantly. Jorah makes no move to respond). A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. (Jorah looks downtrodden). And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely.\n\nJorah stops steering and approaches Tyrion. Tyrion holds out his hands again, but Jorah strikes him, knocking him unconscious. He then goes back to steering, looking worried.\n\nCUT TO: YUNKAI\n\nEXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY\n\nDaenerys and Ser Barristan stand on the balcony.\n\nDAENERYS: Everyone looks happy enough from up here. (Barristan chuckles). What?\n\nBARRISTAN: I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing.\n\nDAENERYS: Why?\n\nBARRISTAN: He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them.\n\nDAENERYS: He sang to them?\n\nBARRISTAN: Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.\n\nDAENERYS: And what did you do?\n\nBARRISTAN: I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. (Daenerys looks surprised). Well he liked to see how much he could make.\n\nDAENERYS: He was good?\n\nBARRISTAN: He was very good. Viserys never told you?\n\nDAENERYS: He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. (Sits down).\n\nBARRISTAN: Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.\n\nDAENERYS: And what did you do with the money?\n\nBARRISTAN: Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. (They both laugh).\n\nDARIO: (Entering). Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber.\n\nDAENERYS: How many others are there?\n\nDARIO: Fifty a hundred.\n\nDAENERYS: Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?\n\nDARIO: I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.\n\nDAENERYS: I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.\n\nBARRISTAN: Your Grace. (Leaves).\n\nINT. AUDIENCE CHAMBER\n\nHIZDAHR: All men must die. But not all can die in glory.\n\nMISSANDEI: Glory?\n\nHIZDAHR: Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have.\n\nDAENERYS: Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?\n\nHIZDAHR: Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season.\n\nDAENERYS: I do not recognize this tradition.\n\nHIZDAHR: Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. (Shots of Sons of the Harpy walking through tunnels with torches). Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start.\n\nEXT. MARKETPLACE\n\nA prostitute and a soldier laugh with each other. Another soldier talks with some women. Some Sons of the Harpy kill all of the soldiers in the area, causing panic. In a nearby alley, some Unsullied march. Hearing the chaos, they begin running towards the market. They find the prostitute crying over the body of the dead soldier.\n\nWOMAN: (Speaking another language) Sons of the Harpy.\n\nShe gestures in the direction the sons went. The Unsullied run in that direction. When they are out of view, she stops her act and wipes the tears away. The Unsullied enter a corridor, expecting to catch the sons. Instead, they themselves are ambushed from every direction by Sons of the Harpy. After a tense few moments, a fight breaks out. During the fight, one of the Unsullied s helmet is knocked off, and is revealed to be Grey Worm. Another fight breaks out elsewhere. The two Unsullied there are killed almost immediately. Barristan walks down an alley and, upon noticing the chaos, heads to the fighting. Grey Worm is badly injured, and with his party killed, also badly outnumbered. Unsullied are shown being killed elsewhere. Grey Worm continues holding off the sons, and Barristan arrives to assist him. They are able to kill all of the sons, but are both seriously injured in the process. They fall unconscious, and the camera pans up to show them surrounded by all of the dead sons and Unsullied.\n\nEND EPISODE\n\n", "episode_45": "\n\nTITLE SEQUENCE\n\nINT. ROOM\n\nGrey Worm lays in a bed, asleep. Missandei stands over him, crying.\n\nINT. THRONE ROOM\n\nThe room is dark, except for some candles. Daenerys and Daario stand over the body of Barristan. Hizdahr enters with two men.\n\nHIZDAHR: I am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man.\n\nDAENERYS: \"Barristan the Bold\" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.\n\nDAARIO: We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide.\n\nDaario walks over the Daenerys and looks at Hizdahr. He looks back. Daenerys turns around.\n\nDAENERYS: I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.\n\nHIZDAHR: But... I'm the leader of my family.\n\nDaario nods. The two men behind Hizdahr grab and restrain him. He is taken away.\n\nHIZDAHR: No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!\n\nINT. DRAGON CHAMBER\n\nDaenerys, Daario, some Unsullied, and a number of men stand in the chamber. Daario holds a torch. After a few moments, Daenerys turns around and begins walking. Daario follows her. Then a chain can be heard rattling. Daenerys and Daario turn around.\n\nDAENERYS: (in Valyrian) Walk forward.\n\nThe Unsullied lower their spears at the other men.\n\nMAN: (Valyrian) You cannot do this.\n\nThe Unsullied begin walking forward, forcing the men to move. After a few moments, they stop. Chains rattle again.\n\nDAENERYS: (Valyrian) Another step.\n\nThe Unsullied and the men take another step. Chains rattle and an unseen dragon snarls. Daenerys walks through the Unsullied to the front of the group.\n\nDAENERYS: (Valyrian) They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don t. Children. Some say I should give up on them. (One of the men is mumbling). But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must.\n\nDaenerys looks at Daario. He walks over and pushes the mumbling man forward, onto his knees.\n\nDAENERYS: (Valyrian) But she does not give up on them.\n\nThe man s eyes widen. A dragon comes out of the shadows and breathes fire on him. He screams and dies. The dragons take his corpse, tear it in two, and eat it.\n\nDAENERYS: (Valyrian) Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, (Looks at Hizdahr), maybe none of you are. Maybe, (Touching Hizdahr s arm), I should let the dragons decide.\n\nHIZDAHR: (Valyrian) All men must die.\n\nThe other men besides Hizdahr grovel before Daenerys. The dragons continue eating. After a moment, she takes her hand off of Hizdahr.\n\nDAENERYS: Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.\n\nDaario and the Unsullied take the men out. Daenerys watches her dragons eat for a moment, and then walks out herself.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK\n\nINT. LIBRARY\n\nSam sits at a table, reading a letter. Aemon is with him.\n\nSAM: \"And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure.\" She sounds like quite a woman.\n\nAEMON: And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying.\n\nSAM: Don't say that, Maester Aemon.\n\nAEMON: A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing.\n\nJon walks in.\n\nJON: Maester Aemon.\n\nAEMON: Lord Commander.\n\nJON: Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.\n\nSam gets up, grabs his papers, and leaves. Jon walks over and sits at the table.\n\nJON: How are you feeling?\n\nAEMON: Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death.\n\nJON: I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.\n\nAEMON: Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it.\n\nJON: But you don't know what it is.\n\nAEMON: That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born.\n\nINT. ROOM\n\nJon and Tormund sit across from each other at a table.\n\nJON: Where are the rest of the free folk now? (Tormund scoffs). Where have they gone? (No response). Who leads them?\n\nTORMUND: They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.\n\nJON: What about you?\n\nTORMUND: Hard to lead when you're in chains.\n\nJON: What if I unchained you?\n\nTORMUND: Why would you do that?\n\nJON: Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.\n\nTORMUND: You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.\n\nJON: For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you.\n\nTORMUND: And now everything is going to change?\n\nJON: It is.\n\nTORMUND: Why now?\n\nJON: Because now, (Leans forward), I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.\n\nTORMUND: What would you have me do, (Leans forward), Lord Commander?\n\nJON: (Stands up). I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.\n\nTORMUND: They won't kneel for you and neither will I.\n\nJON: I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.\n\nTORMUND: The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.\n\nJON: And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward.\n\nTORMUND: (Stands up). Easy thing to say to a man in chains.\n\nJon unchains Tormund. Tormund s eyes widen as he feels his hands.\n\nJON: Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.\n\nTORMUND: Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?\n\nJON: Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.\n\nTORMUND: We'll need ships.\n\nJON: I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.\n\nTORMUND: All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won t be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go.\n\nINT. DINING HALL\n\nThe Night s Watchmen present talk amongst themselves. Stannis and Davos are present. Jon stands at a table in the front of the room with Allister and two others. One of them addresses Jon.\n\nMAN 1: You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?\n\nJON: Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.\n\nMAN 1: Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us.\n\nSome of the men in the crowd cheer.\n\nSTANNIS: Fewer.\n\nDAVOS: What?\n\nSTANNIS: Nothing.\n\nSAM: (Standing up) There is good farmland in the Gift. (Laughter). Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.\n\nMAN 2: And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.\n\nThe man points to Olly, who lowers his head. Sam sits down.\n\nALLISTER: We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.\n\nJON: And we've slaughtered theirs.\n\nEDD: I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. (Men mumble in agreement). They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it.\n\nJON: You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that.\n\nThe men in the room return to bickering loudly.\n\nINT. LORD COMMANDER S ROOM\n\nJon walks in, takes off his coat, and puts his hands on his desk. Olly knocks and walks in with a plate of food, and sets it down.\n\nJON: Thank you. (Olly walks away). Olly. (He stops). If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right.\n\nOLLY: You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them.\n\nJON: It's not a trick.\n\nOLLY: They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.\n\nJON: I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.\n\nOLLY: Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?\n\nJON: No.\n\nOlly leaves. Jon sighs.\n\nCUT TO: WINTERFELL\n\nEXT. COURTYARD\n\nPodrick walks carrying some supplies. He enters a building. Inside, Brienne stares out of a window. Podrick sets down the supplies.\n\nPODRICK: She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.\n\nBRIENNE: (Turns around). Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.\n\nA man enters with some water and a towel.\n\nBRIENNE: Thank you. You've lived here a long time?\n\nMAN: Aye.\n\nBRIENNE: Did you know Lord Eddard?\n\nMAN: I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.\n\nBRIENNE: Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.\n\nMAN: Everyone knows. The Boltons.\n\nBRIENNE: I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.\n\nMAN: Who are you?\n\nBRIENNE: Someone who swore to keep her safe.\n\nMAN: Swore to who?\n\nBRIENNE: Her mother.\n\nMAN: Her mother's dead.\n\nBRIENNE: That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?\n\nINT. RAMSAY S CHAMBERS\n\nMyranda stands naked in front of a window.\n\nRAMSAY: Come back here. Myranda.\n\nMYRANDA: I saw you staring at her.\n\nRAMSAY: I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.\n\nMYRANDA: You said you'd marry me.\n\nRAMSAY: And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.\n\nMYRANDA: Do you think she's pretty?\n\nRAMSAY: Of course I do. I'm not blind.\n\nRamsay sighs and gets up. He walks over to Myranda and grabs her waist.\n\nRAMSAY: You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you.\n\nMYRANDA: Perhaps I'll marry, too.\n\nRAMSAY: (Laughs). You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? (She tries to hit him, but he restrains her). You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?\n\nAfter a moment, Myranda kisses him. She then bites down hard on his lower lip, causing it to bleed.\n\nMYRANDA: (Smiles). Never.\n\nRamsay smiles back. They begin having sex.\n\nINT. SANSA S CHAMBERS\n\nSansa sits alone at a table. There s a knock on the door. She turns, gets up, and opens it. An old servant woman comes in.\n\nWOMAN: Beg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin.\n\nSANSA: Oh, I don't need-\n\nWOMAN: (Closes the door). You still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower.\n\nSANSA: But who -\n\nWOMAN: You're not alone.\n\nThe woman leaves, and closes the door.\n\nEXT. OUTSIDE\n\nSansa walks through the snow, looking up at the broken tower. Myranda approaches her.\n\nMYRANDA: I like your dress. Who made it for you?\n\nSANSA: I made it myself.\n\nMYRANDA: Really?\n\nSANSA: Who, who are you?\n\nMYRANDA: I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? (Takes Sansa s arm and inspects her sleeve). Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?\n\nSANSA: My mother. (Pulls away).\n\nMYRANDA: I'm sorry for what happened to her.\n\nSANSA: Thank you.\n\nMYRANDA: It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her.\n\nSANSA: I'd rather have a mother.\n\nMYRANDA: I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember.\n\nINT. DUNGEON ENTRANCE\n\nMyranda opens the gate and lets Sansa in. Some dogs bark.\n\nMYRANDA: Down there at the end.\n\nSANSA: What is it?\n\nMYRANDA: That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it.\n\nThe dogs continue barking and growling. Sansa walks down the aisle of cages. Most contain dogs. Sansa looks behind to see Myranda has disappeared. She comes to the last cage, which is open. Inside is Theon, on the floor. He gets up and notices her.\n\nSANSA: Theon?\n\nTHEON: You shouldn't be here.\n\nShe looks at him angrily. He backs away from her. She leaves.\n\nINT. RAMSAY S CHAMBERS\n\nTheon unties Ramsay s jacket.\n\nRAMSAY: You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.\n\nTheon walks over to a table and pours some wine. He then brings it over to Ramsay, who drinks it.\n\nRAMSAY: Do you have something to tell me?\n\nTHEON: No, my lord.\n\nRAMSAY: Reek.\n\nTHEON: (Stuttering). She saw me.\n\nRAMSAY: Who?\n\nTHEON: Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.\n\nRAMSAY: She saw you?\n\nTHEON: Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -\n\nRAMSAY: Come here.\n\nTheon walks forward. Ramsay holds his chin.\n\nRAMSAY: You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees.\n\nTheon gets on his knees. Ramsay sips his wine, and then puts it aside. Theon looks down.\n\nRAMSAY: Give me your hand.\n\nTheon hesitantly holds his hand up. As Ramsay takes it, Theon begins stammering. After a moment, Ramsay cups Theon s hand with his own hands.\n\nRAMSAY: I forgive you.\n\nTheon looks up. Ramsay smiles.\n\nINT. DINING HALL\n\nSansa, Ramsay, Roose, and Walda sit at a table, eating.\n\nROOSE: I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady.\n\nSANSA: Yes, thank you, my lord.\n\nRAMSAY: Allow me.\n\nRamsay pours Sansa some wine.\n\nRAMSAY: Mother.\n\nWALDA: Thank you, Ramsay.\n\nHe pours her some wine as well. She smiles. Ramsay gets up and holds his wine up.\n\nRAMSAY: My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth.\n\nROOSE: (Raises his cup). To your wedding.\n\nWALDA: (Raises her cup). To your wedding.\n\nRamsay takes a large sip of wine. Sansa puts her own glass down. Ramsay sits down.\n\nWALDA: It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.\n\nSANSA: This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.\n\nRAMSAY: You're right. Very strange. More wine, please.\n\nTheon enters the room with some wine. Sansa looks away.\n\nRAMSAY: I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. (Theon begins pouring wine). I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?\n\nTHEON: (Turns around). Yes, master.\n\nRAMSAY: That's his new name, Reek.\n\nSANSA: Why are you doing this?\n\nRAMSAY: Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? (He gestures Theon over). An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers.\n\nTheon shakes his head \"no\" when Ramsay looks away\n\nTHEON: (After a moment, stuttering). I'm sorry.\n\nRAMSAY: Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye.\n\nTHEON: I'm sorry.\n\nRAMSAY: Sorry about what?\n\nTHEON: For killing your brothers.\n\nRAMSAY: There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. (Theon turns to leave). You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?\n\nROOSE: Yes, yes, very good.\n\nRAMSAY: Wonderful. (Sips wine).\n\nROOSE: Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together.\n\nWALDA: We're going to have a baby.\n\nSANSA: I'm very happy for you.\n\nROOSE: From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.\n\nRamsay sips some wine and angrily sets his cup down. Sansa looks at him smugly.\n\nINT. ROOSE S WAR ROOM\n\nRamsay and Roose sit at a war table.\n\nRAMSAY: How can you be sure?\n\nROOSE: Sure of what?\n\nRAMSAY: That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?\n\nROOSE: Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.\n\nRamsay gets up and walks around to the other side of the table, wine in hand.\n\nRAMSAY: So how did you manage it?\n\nROOSE: Manage what?\n\nRAMSAY: Getting her pregnant.\n\nROOSE: I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.\n\nRAMSAY: Of course, but how did you find it?\n\nROOSE: You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl.\n\nRAMSAY: And if it's a boy?\n\nROOSE: You're worried about your position.\n\nRAMSAY: My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.\n\nRamsay finished his wine and goes to get more.\n\nROOSE: You've never asked me about your mother.\n\nRAMSAY: Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are.\n\nROOSE: She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. (Stands up). But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. (After a moment). Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?\n\nRAMSAY: Yes.\n\nCUT TO: CASTLE BLACK\n\nINT. LIBRARY\n\nGilly walks through the bookshelves, examining them. Sam sits at the table reading.\n\nGILLY: Is this every book there is?\n\nSAM: Every book there is?\n\nGILLY: In the world.\n\nSAM: Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually.\n\nGILLY: Where you grew up, were there more books?\n\nSAM: My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.\n\nGILLY: Where's that?\n\nSAM: The Citadel? In Oldtown.\n\nGILLY: I'm sorry I don't know things.\n\nSAM: Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound.\n\nGILLY: I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.\n\nSAM: Well -\n\nGILLY: Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?\n\nSAM: It's where they train the maesters.\n\nGILLY: Like Maester Aemon?\n\nSAM: I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you.\n\nStannis enters the library. Sam stands up.\n\nSAM: Ah, Your Grace.\n\nGilly quickly exits.\n\nSTANNIS: You're Samwell Tarly?\n\nSAM: I am, Your Grace.\n\nSTANNIS: Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker.\n\nSAM: I did, Your Grace.\n\nSTANNIS: How?\n\nSAM: With a dagger made of dragonglass.\n\nSTANNIS: Dragonglass?\n\nSAM: What the maesters call obsidian -\n\nSTANNIS: I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?\n\nSAM: I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.\n\nSTANNIS: The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.\n\nSAM: I've seen it, Your Grace.\n\nSTANNIS: Seen what?\n\nSAM: The army of the dead. And when they come -\n\nSTANNIS: We have to know how to fight them. (After a moment). Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.\n\nStannis leaves.\n\nINT. DINING HALL\n\nDavos carves away at a piece of wood. Stannis approaches him.\n\nSTANNIS: It's time.\n\nDAVOS: Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.\n\nSTANNIS: If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise.\n\nDAVOS: I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.\n\nSTANNIS: No need, they're coming with us.\n\nDAVOS: It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -\n\nSTANNIS: Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us.\n\nThey walk outside.\n\nDAVOS: As you wish, Your Grace.\n\nStannis walks away. Davos spots Melisandre.\n\nEXT. COURTYARD - THE NEXT MORNING\n\nStannis s men prepare to ride out. Sam and Gilly watch. Gilly holds baby Sam. Olly, Edd, and some other watchmen are also shown watching.\n\nSHIREEN: (On horseback). Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?\n\nDAVOS: Beg your pardon?\n\nSHIREEN: At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-\n\nDAVOS: First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.\n\nSHIREEN: Is there going to be a battle?\n\nDAVOS: Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -\n\nSELYSE: That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child.\n\nDAVOS: Yes, my queen.\n\nSHIREEN: I'm not scared.\n\nDAVOS: Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me.\n\nSHIREEN: (Smiling). I promise.\n\nShireen looks back at Gilly. Selyse catches her, and she looks down and away. Jon walks through the courtyard. He and Stannis meet on some stairs.\n\nSTANNIS: I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.\n\nJON: You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you.\n\nJon watches Stannis walk away and get on his horse. He makes eye contact with Melisandre, but she looks away. Stannis and his army begin leaving.\n\nCUT TO: MEEREN\n\nINT. GREY WORM S ROOM\n\nMissandei watches over Grey Worm. He suddenly gets up, startling her.\n\nMISSANDEI:  You're still too weak. (He lays back down).\n\nGREY WORM: (Valyrian) How long have I been here?\n\nMISSANDEI: (Valyrian) Three days.\n\nHe looks at her. His face is bruised.\n\nGREY WORM: Ser Barristan?\n\nMissandei shakes her head.\n\nGREY WORM: (Valyrian) I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen.\n\nMISSANDEI: (Valyrian) You failed no one. You fought bravely. You ll fight again. (In Common Tongue) Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known.\n\nGREY WORM: This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid.\n\nMISSANDEI: All men fear death.\n\nGREY WORM: No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath.\n\nMissandei looks down, on the verge of tears. She gets up and lies down in the bed with him, caressing his face, and then kissing him.\n\nINT. DAENERYS S CHAMBERS\n\nMissandei and Daenerys stand, talking.\n\nMISSANDEI: Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.\n\nDAENERYS: If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?\n\nMISSANDEI: Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters.\n\nDAENERYS: (Sitting down). You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?\n\nMISSANDEI: I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. (Sitting down). I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see.\n\nINT. DUNGEONS\n\nDaenerys is led by Unsullied to a room in a dungeon. The door is opened to reveal Hizdahr. She enters, and he kneels before her.\n\nHIZDAHR: My, my queen, please do not do this.\n\nDAENERYS: What about \"Valar Morghulis\"?\n\nHIZDAHR: I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. (Sniffles).\n\nDAENERYS: It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live.\n\nHIZDAHR: Yes, my queen.\n\nDAENERYS: And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. (Hizdahr nods). Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.\n\nHizdahr looks surprised. Daenerys faintly smiles, and then leaves. Hizdahr is left in the cell, with the door wide open.\n\nCUT TO: SEA\n\nEXT. JORAH S BOAT\n\nTyrion wakes up and feels his head.\n\nTYRION: Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. (No response). Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.\n\nJORAH: We are.\n\nTYRION: What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.\n\nJORAH: No wine.\n\nTYRION: I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not \n\nJorah stands up and looks ahead. Tyrion turns as well. A large bank of fog lies ahead of the boat.\n\nTYRION: I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.\n\nJORAH: I am.\n\nTYRION: Have you sailed this route before?\n\nJORAH: No.\n\nTYRION: You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?\n\nJORAH: I think you'll be plenty.\n\nTYRION: You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?\n\nJORAH: No. But the pirates are.\n\nTYRION: Oh.\n\nEXT. RIVER SURROUNDED BY WOODS\n\nTYRION: The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -\n\nJORAH: And then they weren't.\n\nTYRION: And then they weren't. \"They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -\"\n\nJORAH: \"The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.\"\n\nTYRION: I would clap.\n\nHe holds up his bound hands. Jorah smirks.\n\nTYRION: I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains.\n\nThey look at the approaching ruins of the city. Suddenly Tyrion spots Drogon passing overhead. He stands up. Both of them look up and watch as he passes. Behind Tyrion, someone hops in the water. Jorah hears the splash and turns to see the ripples.\n\nTYRION: What was that?\n\nThe boat passes into a tunnel. A Stone Man jumps down into the boat from the ceiling.\n\nJORAH: Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!\n\nJorah hits the stone man from behind before he gets to Tyrion. They begin fighting. Another stone man jumps into the water and begins trying to get on the boat. Tyrion tries to keep him off. Jorah manages to push the first man into the water. He then begins fighting the other one.\n\nJORAH: Get behind!\n\nTYRION: Mormont, cut me free! (Jorah falls into the water). Mormont!\n\nJorah climbs back onto the boat and fights off the stone man. He manages to get his sword and cuts the stone man. The other stone man inches his way towards Tyrion.\n\nTYRION: Mormont! Mormont!\n\nJorah cuts through the stone man he was fighting and pushes him into the water. Tyrion rolls into the water to avoid the other one. He desperately tries to remove the rope around his hands. A stone man grabs his ankle and begins attempting to pull him down. The screen fades to black. After a few moments, we see Tyrion s perspective. Jorah stands over him as his eyes slowly blink open.\n\nEXT. SHORE\n\nJORAH: (Faintly). Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.\n\nTyrion looks around. Jorah helps him up. He unsheathes his knife and cuts Tyrion s binds.\n\nJORAH: You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?\n\nTYRION: (Shakes his head). You? (Jorah shakes his head). I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.\n\nJORAH: I suppose that's why they send them there.\n\nTYRION: It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. (Jorah spits). Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. (Jorah gets up). So what now?\n\nJORAH: We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat.\n\nTYRION: Without luck?\n\nJORAH: We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?\n\nTYRION: That's the best idea you've had all day.\n\nJorah walks away. After looking out for a moment, he stops, and pulls up his sleeve. He examines his wrist, which has the beginnings of greyscale. After a moment, he begins walking again.\n\n", "episode_46": "\n\nINT.

My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn t want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison.

Drove my sword through his back.\n\nJaqen hits her again.\n\nJAQEN: A lie.\n\nARYA: I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.\n\nJaqen hits her.\n\nJAQEN: A lie.\n\nARYA: A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight.

We can t live on berries and roots.\n\nJORAH: I can.\n\nTYRION: You re not hungry?\n\nJORAH: Of course I m hungry.\n\nTYRION: You re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met.\n\nJORAH: I am not your travelling companion.\n\nTYRION: We are travelling together. In each other s company. Therefore \n\nJORAH: Do you ever shut up?\n\nTYRION: I sailed from King s Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.\n\nJorah sits down next to Tyrion.\n\nJORAH: Why?\n\nTYRION: Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.\n\nJORAH: I m sure you ve visited many brothels in many cities.\n\nTYRION: I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.\n\nJorah gets up.\n\nTYRION: As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.\n\nJORAH: What do you know about my father?\n\nTYRION: I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch?  We shall never see his like again. \n\nJorah looks stunned.\n\nTYRION: You didn t know. I m sorry. I am.\n\nJORAH: How?\n\nTYRION: I only know what I heard\n\nJORAH (stronger): How?\n\nTYRION: He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny.

But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me.\n\nArya fills a cup with the water.\n\nARYA: I ve devoted my life to him now. You don t want to hurt anymore. Drink.\n\nThe girl takes a sip.

As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert s Rebellion.\n\nJORAH: Do you believe in anything?\n\nTYRION: I believe in many things.\n\nJORAH: In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?\n\nTYRION: No.\n\nJORAH: Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I d find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?\n\nTYRION: No.\n\nJORAH: It's hard to be a cynic after that.\n\nTYRION: Doesn t mean she s going to be a great queen.\n\nJORAH: No it doesn t.\n\nTYRION: The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?\n\nJORAH: First we have to conquer the world.\n\nTYRION: We? Alright, let s assume your dreams come true. She s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?\n\nJORAH: Then she rules.\n\nTYRION: So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That s justice?\n\nJORAH: She is the rightful heir.\n\nTYRION: Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?\n\nJorah sees a ship anchored in the middle of the sea and pushes Tyrion behind a rock.\n\nJORAH: Shh! It s a slave ship\n\nTYRION: Why is it anchored?\n\nJORAH: They probably came ashore for--\n\nMALKO: --water.\n\nMalko and his men, all carrying swords, surround Tyrion and Jorah, smiling.\n\nSAME PLACE - LATER\n\nTyrion and Jorah s hands are tied. Malko punches Jorah in the face. He gets up.\n\nMALKO: Got a lot of fight in you, huh?\n\nMalko punches Jorah again.\n\nSLAVER: Salt mines.\n\nMALKO: That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.\n\nSLAVER: What about the dwarf?\n\nMALKO: Worthless. Cut his throat.\n\nThe slaver s man approaches Tyrion.\n\nTYRION: Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let s discuss this!\n\nMALKO: And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf s cock has magic powers.\n\nThe slaver puts his sword to Tyrion s throat.\n\nTYRION: Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?\n\nSLAVER: It will be a dwarf-sized cock.\n\nTYRION: Guess again.\n\nTyrion looks to Malko.\n\nMALKO: The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.\n\nThe slavers get Jorah and Tyrion to their feet.\n\nJORAH: Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.\n\nMALKO: We re bound to Volantis, not Slaver s Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits.\n\nTYRION: The fighting puts in Mereen! You re in luck then, you re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.\n\nMalko looks at Tyrion and laughs.\n\nTYRION: (looks at Jorah) Him.\n\nMALKO: Him? He s got to be 60 years old.\n\nTYRION: Sure, he s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!\n\nMalko gestures to his men to bring Jorah closer.\n\nMalko: Is that true?\n\nJorah nods.\n\nTYRION: He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.\n\nMalko shakes his head and laughs.\n\nTYRION: The Kingslayer!\n\nMALKO: Jousting. You re talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.\n\nJORAH: I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.\n\nMalko jumps up, shocked, and gets in Jorah s face.\n\nMALKO: Liar.\n\nJORAH: It s no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I ll prove my worth.\n\nMalko looks in his eyes, smiles, then nods.\n\nEXT. KING S LANDING - STREETS\n\nLittlefinger walks by the Faith Militant.\n\nLANCEL: Lord Baelish.\n\nBAELISH: Yes? (Lancel approaches him) Lancel Lannister.\n\nLANCEL: Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.\n\nBAELISH: That s quite a family to abandon.\n\nLANCEL: The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run.\n\nBAELISH: Well done.\n\nHe tries to walk past Lancel. Lancel puts his hand on Baelish s shoulder and stops him.\n\nBAELISH: I m here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I ll be delayed?\n\nLancel lets go.\n\nLANCEL: Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You ll find that there s little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King s Landing.\n\nBAELISH: We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining.\n\nINT. CERSEI S ROOM\n\nBAELISH: Do you think it s wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?\n\nCERSEI: The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.\n\nBAELISH: Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.\n\nCERSEI: The King s orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras  perversion?\n\nBAELISH: House Tyrell won t tolerate these insults.\n\nCERSEI: House Tyrell won t tolerate it? I m the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys.\n\nBAELISH: One s choice of companion is a curious thing.\n\nCersei is silent for a moment.\n\nCERSEI: Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you re still in mourning.\n\nBAELISH: Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.\n\nCERSEI: She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him.\n\nBAELISH: I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.\n\nCERSEI: If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?\n\nBAELISH: Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.\n\nCERSEI: Good. (Cersei gets up) If there s nothing else.\n\nBAELISH: There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn t trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell.\n\nCERSEI: That s not possible.\n\nBAELISH: My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.\n\nCERSEI: Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.\n\nBAELISH: Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.\n\nCERSEI: We were fools to trust a turncloak.\n\nBAELISH: Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.\n\nCERSEI: I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.\n\nBAELISH: I would counsel patience, your grace.\n\nCERSEI: Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor.\n\nBAELISH: Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.\n\nCERSEI: Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn.\n\nBAELISH: That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.\n\nCERSEI: My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.\n\nBAELISH: Ser Jaime, then.\n\nCERSEI: Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I ve no idea when he ll be back.\n\nBAELISH: Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow.\n\nCERSEI: Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man.\n\nBAELISH: You wouldn t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?\n\nCERSEI: And if you succeed?\n\nBAELISH: Name me Warden of the North.\n\nCERSEI: I ll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.\n\nBAELISH: I ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.\n\nCERSEI: And I ll l know you re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark s head on a spike.\n\nBAELISH: As I said.

What is it?\n\nMYRCELLA: Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you \n\nTrystane kisses her in the middle of the sentence. Myrcella pushes him off.\n\nMYRCELLA: We can t. Not yet.\n\nTRYSTANE: Why not?\n\nMYRCELLA: You know why not. Someone will see.\n\nTRYSTANE: You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.\n\nMYRCELLA: How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?\n\nTRYSTANE: I like the way your eyes go squinty when you re jealous.\n\nMYRCELLA: They don t go squinty, and you didnt answer the question.\n\nCut to Doran and Areo on the balcony.\n\nDORAN: They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.\n\nAREO: Yes, my prince.\n\nDORAN: You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.\n\nAREO: I remember how.\n\nEXT. DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE\n\nBRONN (singing): The Dornishman s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring.

The Sand Snakes are here.\n\nBRONN: Oh for fuck s sake.\n\nThe Sand Snakes attack Jaime and Bronn, one wielding a spear, one wielding a whip, and one wielding a pair of daggers. They occupy Bronn and Jaime long enough for Obara to get to Myrcella.\n\nOBARA: You re coming with me.\n\nMYRCELLA: I don t want to!\n\nOBARA: I wasn t asking, princess.\n\nObara starts taking Myrcella out of the gardens. A Sand Snake cuts Bronn s arm open.

Areo puts his axe to Jaime s neck.\n\nAREO: When you were whole, it would have been a good fight.\n\nJaime drops the sword, Areo s men grab him. Bronn drops his sword.\n\nBRONN (to Snake): You fight pretty good for a little girl.\n\nShe screams at Bronn and is restrained by Areo s men. They are all escorted away.

If they arrested all the pillow biters in King s Landing there d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.\n\nMARGAERY: Everyone knew about him and Renly.\n\nOLENNA: Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.\n\nMARGAERY: But he was the king s brother.\n\nOLENNA: And Loras is the queen s brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable.\n\nMARGAERY: Cersei is behind this.\n\nOLENNA: Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.\n\nINT. CERSEI S ROOM\n\nCersei writes at her desk without acknowledging Olenna.\n\nOLENNA: Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.\n\nCERSEI: You must be exhausted.\n\nOLENNA: Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren t writing anything.\n\nCERSEI: Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns.\n\nOLENNA: And the famous tart Queen Cersei.\n\nCERSEI: Beg your pardon.\n\nOLENNA: I know you re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.\n\nCERSEI: If you apologize for that comment perhaps--\n\nOLENNA: You ll get your apology when I get Loras.\n\nCERSEI: I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?\n\nOLENNA: Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?\n\nCERSEI: I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--\n\nOLENNA: Do you expect the alliance to continue after you ve thrown our future into prison?\n\nCERSEI: As I said, i didn t imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--\n\nOLENNA: What veil?\n\nCERSEI: The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?\n\nOLENNA: I didn t trust your father. I didn t particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.\n\nCERSEI: House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I m sure they don t. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna.\n\nINT. HIGH SEPTON S ROOM\n\nHIGH SPARROW: You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?\n\nLORAS: I don t pay attention to rumors.\n\nSPARROW: You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis  army closed in\n\nLORAS: He was my friend. He was my king.\n\nSPARROW: Wasn t Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly.\n\nLORAS: I was wrong to support Renly s claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.\n\nSPARROW: Wearing Renly s armor.\n\nLORAS: Why does it matter what I wore?\n\nSPARROW: Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy.\n\nLORAS: Of course I deny them.\n\nSPARROW: You never lay with Renly Baratheon.\n\nLORAS: Never.\n\nSPARROW: Nor any other man.\n\nLORAS: Never.\n\nSPARROW: That will be all Ser Loras.\n\nLoras walks back to his seat.\n\nOLENNA: Well I think that s quite enough of that.\n\nSPARROW: Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.\n\nMARGAERY: You call me forward?\n\nSPARROW: Yes. We have some questions for you.\n\nMARGAERY: I am the queen.\n\nSPARROW: You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest.\n\nMargaery walks to the stand.\n\nSPARROW: How do you respond to these charges against your brother?\n\nMARGAERY: They are lies.\n\nSPARROW: All of them?\n\nMARGAERY: All of them.\n\nSPARROW: Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?\n\nMARGAERY: Yes, I swear it.\n\nSPARROW: Thank you, your grace.\n\nThe Faith brings Olyvar in. Loras looks shocked. Cersei gives a thin smile.\n\nSPARROW: Do you know this man?\n\nOLYVAR: Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.\n\nSPARROW: How did you come to meet?\n\nOLYVAR: I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.\n\nSPARROW: And what occurred in his chamber?\n\nOLYVAR: We engaged in intimate relations.\n\nSPARROW: You laid with him?\n\nOLYVAR: That night and many others.\n\nLORAS: Liar! He s a liar!\n\nSPARROW: Is there anyone else who can support your claim?\n\nOLYVAR: Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn t seem surprised.\n\nCERSEI: This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?\n\nOLYVAR: He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne.\n\nLoras jumps at Olyvar and The Faith restrains him. Margaery and Olenna get up to leave and The Faith blocks their way.\n\nLORAS: Liar!\n\nOLENNA: What are you doing? Let us pass.\n\nSPARROW: The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.\n\nMARGAERY: What?\n\nSPARROW: Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.\n\nThe Faith grabs her and carries her out of the room.\n\nMARGAERY: Tommen! Tommen!\n\nKing Tommen looks around the room, unsure of what to do.\n\nMARGAERY: You can t do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you!\n\nOlenna glares at Cersei. Cersei smiles back.\n\nINT. WINTERFELL - SANSA S CHAMBER\n\nSansa looks at herself in the mirror. She hears a knock and opens the door. It's Myranda.\n\nSANSA: What do you want?\n\nMYRANDA: Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don t you?\n\nCut to Sansa in the bath. Myranda washes the black dye out of Sansa s hair.\n\nMYRANDA: You re so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others.\n\nSANSA: What others?\n\nMYRANDA: I shouldn t gossip. It s good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.\n\nSANSA: What others?\n\nMYRANDA: Let s see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith s daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and  Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don t they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.\n\nSANSA: Hunt?\n\nMYRANDA: Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it s your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?\n\nSANSA: What was your name again?\n\nMYRANDA: Myranda.\n\nSANSA: And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can t frighten me.\n\nMYRANDA: Are you done with your bath, my lady?\n\nSANSA: Go. I can finish on my own.\n\nEXT. SANSA S ROOM - MORNING\n\nSnow falls outside.

He ll punish me.\n\nSANSA: Do you think I care what he does to you.\n\nSansa leaves the room without Theon.\n\nEXT. THE GODSWOOD\n\nSansa walks to the Godswood with Theon. Ramsay is waiting alongside his father and with the Bolton men forming an aisle. Roose walks forward.\n\nROOSE: Who comes before the Old Gods this night?\n\nTHEON: Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?\n\nRamsay steps forward.\n\nRAMSAY: Ramsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her?\n\nTHEON: Theon of House Greyjoy. Who was  who was her father s ward.\n\nROOSE: Lady Sansa, will you take this man?\n\nLong pause. Cut to Ramsay, Walda, and Myranda. Sansa steps forward.\n\nSANSA: I take this man.\n\nRamsay smiles.\n\nINT. RAMSAY S CHAMBERS\n\nTheon opens the door for Ramsay and Sansa.\n\nRAMSAY: Are you pleased my lady?\n\nSansa nods.\n\nRAMSAY: Good. I want you to be happy. My father said you re still a virgin.\n\nSANSA: Yes.\n\nRAMSAY: Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?\n\nSANSA: Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me.\n\nRAMSAY: You re not lying to me?\n\nSANSA: No, my lord.\n\nRAMSAY: Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don t you think?\n\nSANSA: Yes sir.\n\nRamsay kisses her.\n\nRAMSAY: Good. Now take off your clothes.\n\nTheon starts to leave.\n\nRAMSAY: Oh, no no no. You stay here Reek. You watch. (to Sansa) Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time.\n\nSansa starts to undo her coat. Theon closes the door.\n\nRAMSAY: Reek? I told you to watch.\n\nTheon looks up.\n\nRAMSAY: You ve known Sansa since she was a girl. Now watch her become a woman.\n\nRamsay rips Sansa s coat open and pushes her onto the bed. We hear clothes ripping. A belt being undone. Sansa starts moaning.

Jon walks over to Alliser.\n\nJON: First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black.\n\nALLISER: Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings.\n\nCut to Olly watching their conversation from afar.\n\nJON: As always, thank you for your honesty.\n\nJon walks away to Sam.\n\nSAM: Safe travels, Lord Commander.\n\nJON: Thank you, Sam.\n\nSAM: Oh, and \n\nSam hands him a wrapped package. Jon opens it to find a sword.\n\nSAM: It s Dragonglass. It s what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you don t need them.\n\nJON: Me too.\n\nThey hug.

I can t leave him now.\n\nAEMON (panicked): Egg! Egg.. I dreamed... that I was old\n\nEXT. CASTLE BLACK\n\nClose up on Maester Aemon s funeral pyre.\n\nSAM: His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King s Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night s Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended.\n\nBROTHERS: And now his watch has ended.\n\nSam lights the pyre, then hands the torch to Alliser, who lights it then passes it along.\n\nALLISER: You re losing all your friends, Tarly.\n\nSam looks up to see a Brother glaring at him.\n\nEXT. WINTERFELL\n\nSansa walks up to Ramsay.\n\nRAMSAY: My beautiful wife.\n\nHe kisses her.\n\nRAMSAY: When my father told me we were marrying I half expected a fat, bearded beast. Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you? You ve made me very happy.\n\nThey start walking down stairs. Sansa grabs a cross in the snow before they leave.\n\nRAMSAY: Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell. He s a respected commander. His troops are loyal and battle tested. He s hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army. But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in frost. His army s out there now, suffering in the snow. One day I ll be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. You ll be my Lady and Wardeness.\n\nSANSA: But isn t your step mother pregnant?\n\nRAMSAY: What of it?\n\nSANSA: What happens if she has a boy?\n\nRAMSAY: Then I ll have a baby brother.\n\nSANSA: But he ll be the heir.\n\nRAMSAY: I m Lord Bolton s eldest son.\n\nSANSA: But you re a bastard, a true born will always have the stronger claim.\n\nRamsay stops walking.\n\nRAMSAY: I ve been naturalized by a royal decree of--\n\nSANSA: Tommen Baratheon. Another bastard.\n\nThey start walking again.\n\nRAMSAY: Bastards can rise high in the world. Like your half-brother Jon Snow. Born The Bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Night s Watch.\n\nSansa looks shocked.\n\nRAMSAY: You didn t know? Yes, he s done very well for himself. Ah.

Reek told me you wanted to leave.\n\nCut to Theon looking terrified.\n\nRAMSAY: Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband.\n\nSansa continues to look at the woman, horrified.\n\nRAMSAY: Tough old bird. Everyone talks when I start beating them. But this one. Her heart gave out before I got to her face. We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. It s far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now.\n\nHe kisses her on the cheek then she is carried away.\n\nEXT.

We can t open the supply line until the snow clears.\n\nSTANNIS: What else?\n\nDAVOS: The Stormcrows rode off last night.\n\nSTANNIS: 500 men.\n\nDavos nods. Stannis removes a Baratheon piece from his chess board.\n\nSTANNIS: Sell swords, loyal to nothing but gold.\n\nDAVOS: We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won t be marching anywhere in this weather.\n\nSTANNIS: And?\n\nDAVOS: This isn t our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears.\n\nSTANNIS: I retreated from King s Landing, Ser Davos. If I retreat again, I become  The King Who Ran. \n\nDAVOS: Your Grace..\n\nSTANNIS: Winter is coming. Those arent just the Stark words, it s a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last.\n\nDAVOS: It s better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.\n\nSTANNIS: This is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we ve lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward,\n\nDavos looks to Melisandre, lurking in the back of the tent.\n\nDAVOS: Your Grace. (leaves)\n\nSTANNIS (to Melisandre): I ve trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years.\n\nMELISANDRE: You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow.\n\nSTANNIS: I don t know what I saw.\n\nMELISANDRE: You do know. Trust yourself.\n\nSTANNIS: And you, do you trust yourself?\n\nMELISANDRE: I trust in the Lord.\n\nSTANNIS: Are you sure?\n\nMELISANDRE: I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.\n\nShe flips the Bolton pieces over on Stannis  board.\n\nMELISANDRE: But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.\n\nSTANNIS: We don t have Robert s bastard here.\n\nMELISANDRE: No, we have someone better, and your blood runs through her veins.\n\nSTANNIS: Have you lost your mind?\n\nMELISANDRE: Do you doubt me still? After all that you ve seen?\n\nSTANNIS: There must be another way. Leeches or something.\n\nMELISANDRE: There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.\n\nSTANNIS: She s my daughter.\n\nMelisandre embraces him.\n\nSTANNIS: Get out.\n\nINT.

The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished.\n\nThe High Sparrow heads for the door.\n\nOLENNA: Don t you walk away from me.\n\nSPARROW: You don t give commands here, Lady Olenna.\n\nOLENNA: What is it you want? Gold? I ll make you the richest septon who ever lived.\n\nThe High Sparrow laughs.\n\nOLENNA: What then?\n\nSPARROW: I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I m telling you a simple truth: I serve the gods. The gods demand justice.\n\nOLENNA: How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?\n\nSPARROW: By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don t have one in your library I ll give you my own.\n\nOLENNA (with contempt): I ve read the seven pointed star.\n\nSPARROW: Then you ll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.\n\nOLENNA: Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?\n\nSPARROW: Yes. The Gods  laws must be applied to all equally.\n\nOLENNA: If it s equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I ll make sure the hungry know who to blame,\n\nSPARROW: Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few \n\nHe walks out of the room.\n\nEXT. SEPT OF BAELOR\n\nSQUIRE: Lady Olenna.\n\nHe hands her a letter with Baelish's mockingbird sigil.\n\nINT. KING S LANDING - DINING ROOM\n\nCERSEI: Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love.\n\nTOMMEN: She s in a prison cell and there s nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there s nothing I can do!\n\nTommen walks to the window. Cersei joins him.\n\nCERSEI: No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control.\nEvents you couldn't possibly have anticipated or prevented even if you had. You cannot blame yourself for fate. Your father, your brother, your grandfather-- I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do? Hold them as they left this world. Kissed their heads after they'd gone.\n\nTOMMEN: I ll call in the army. I ll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I ll start a war if I have to.\n\nCERSEI: You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.\n\nTOMMEN: I love her. I love her. I can t help her.\n\nCERSEI: We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.\n\nTOMMEN: I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--\n\nCERSEI: Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.\n\nCERSEI: Your happiness is all I want in this world\n\nTOMMEN: I know.\n\nCERSEI: No you don t. You can t possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy.\n\nCersei embraces him and starts crying.\n\nINT. DORNE\n\nJaime is being kept in a closely monitored room.\n\nAREO: Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess s wellbeing.\n\nAreo brings Myrcella into the room.\n\nMYRCELLA: You looked different when I left. You had more hair.\n\nJAIME: And more hands. How s Trystane?\n\nMYRCELLA: He ll be alright.\n\nJAIME: I m sorry for that. It wasn t supposed to happen that way.\n\nMYRCELLA: Why is it happening at all?\n\nJAIME: Your mother s worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I ve come to take you home.\n\nMYRCELLA: This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn t want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she s forcing me to go back?\n\nJAIME: It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.\n\nMYRCELLA: It s not complicated at all, it s simple. I love Trystane, I m going to marry him, and we re staying right here.\n\nJAIME: I don t understand.\n\nMYRCELLA: Of course you don t! You don t know me!\n\nMyrcella leaves the room.\n\nINT. DORNE - CELL\n\nBRONN (singing): Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman s taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I ve tasted the Dornishman s wife! Yes I ve tasted the Dornishman s wife!\n\nIn the adjacent cell to Bronn, Tyene claps as the other Snakes glare at her.\n\nTYENE: He s got a good voice.\n\nOBARA: We re lucky he s a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.\n\nBRONN: It s against my code to hurt a woman.\n\nOBARA: It s amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.\n\nBRONN: I wouldn t say you beat me.\n\nTYENE: How s your arm?\n\nBRONN: Wonderful. Wouldn t feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.\n\nTYENE: You think you re leaving Dorne?\n\nBRONN: No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.\n\nTYENE: Thank you.\n\nBRONN: I said Dornish women. I didn t say you.\n\nTYENE: I m not the most beautiful woman you ve ever seen?\n\nBRONN: I ve seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nTYENE: Name one more beautiful than I am.\n\nBRONN: Well now, in King s Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous...\n\nTyene takes one of her breasts out of her tunic.\n\nTYENE: There was a what? In King s Landing you were saying.\n\nBRONN: Was I?\n\nTYENE: There was a woman more beautiful than I am.\n\nTyene takes both her breasts out.\n\nBRONN: Was there? My memory s not what it was earlier.\n\nTYENE: How s your arm now?\n\nBRONN: You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.\n\nTyene undoes the rest of her tunic.\n\nTYENE: And how about your head?\n\nBRONN: My head  You don t even wanna know what s going on in \n\nAs Bronn scans her naked body, his vision starts to blur and he collapses to the ground.\n\nTYENE: Your nose is bleeding.\n\nBRONN: It s nothing. It s the dry air.\n\nTYENE: My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death.\n\nShe holds a tiny blue cap up to Bronn from her cell.\n\nTYENE: The only antidote. Who s the most beautiful woman in the world?\n\nBronn gasps for breath.\n\nTYENE: Sorry? Who?\n\nBRONN (finally): You.\n\nTYENE: Don t drop it.\n\nTyene tosses it into his cell and Bronn downs it.\n\nTYENE: I think you re very handsome as well.\n\nINT. KING S LANDING - BAELISH S BROTHEL\n\nLittlefinger peers at the Great Sept of Baelor through the window. The brothel is destroyed, with many seven-pointed stars scribbled on the floor, walls, and artwork.\n\nBAELISH: I m sorry about the locale.\n\nOLENNA: No you re not.\n\nBAELISH: It felt like the safest place.\n\nOLENNA: Not for your clientele, clearly.\n\nBAELISH: It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn t exist until we invented them.\n\nOLENNA: You ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven t you?\n\nBAELISH: The past is the past. The future is all that s worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.\n\nOLENNA: Don t pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you d return to the capital once things started going wrong.\n\nBAELISH: I promise you..\n\nOLENNA: I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they ll never even find what s left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?\n\nBAELISH: Cersei summoned me to King s Landing. I dared not refuse her.\n\nOLENNA: And what did she want?\n\nBAELISH: A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you.\n\nOLENNA: What kind of gift?\n\nBAELISH: The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.\n\nINT. MEREEN - FIGHTING PITS - WAITING AREA\n\nGladiators prepare their swords and armor.\n\nSLAVE OWNER: Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something.\n\nClose-up on Jorah.\n\nOWNER (O.S.): You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you.\n\nJorah is not one of the gladiators selected.\n\nOWNER: Valar morghulis.\n\nMEN: Valar dohaeris.\n\nOWNER: Prepare yourselves.\n\nEXT. FIGHTING PIT\n\nDAENERYS: Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.\n\nHIZDAHR: For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence.\n\nThe fighters enter the pit.\n\nOWNER: Move yourselves!\n\nThe slave owner sees Daenerys and runs in front of her and Hizdahr.\n\nOWNER: Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.\n\nThe owner gets all his gladiators to face Dany, whispering instructions to them.\n\nOWNER:  We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen. \n\nMEN:  We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen. \n\nThe fight begins\n\nINT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA\n\nJorah hears  O glorious queen  and runs to the edge of the pit. He sees Daenerys through the grated entrance to the ring.\n\nEXT. FIGHTING PIT\n\nOne bald gladiator dominates the pit. He slits one fighter s throat, and slices another fighter s leg as he runs away.\n\nDAENERYS: I think I ve seen enough.\n\nHIZDAHR: Your Grace, it s a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged.\n\nDAENERYS: I ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.\n\nINT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA\n\nJorah straps a helmet on.\n\nTYRION: What are you doing?\n\nEXT. FIGHTING PIT\n\nJorah rushes the pit. His owner tries to stop him but he knocks him out with the butt of his sword. Jorah takes out the bald man as he was smashing a man s head in with a rock. Daenerys takes notice of the fighter but can t see his face.\n\nINT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA\n\nThe other gladiators that weren t chosen to fight follow Jorah s lead and enter the ring. Tyrion tries but is chained up. He starts sawing at his chain.\n\nEXT. FIGHTING PIT\n\nJorah melees a fighter with a shield, then knocks another out with his own helmet.\n\nINT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA\n\nA giant man sees Tyrion sawing at his chains. He raises a giant sword above Tyrion s head, but comes down on the chain, freeing Tyrion. Tyrion nods in thanks.\n\nEXT. FIGHTING PIT\n\nDaenerys is watching intently now. Jorah is the last man standing. He walks up to Daenerys and Hizdahr and removes his helmet. She stares at him for a moment.\n\nDAENERYS: Get him out of my sight.\n\nHer men grab Jorah.\n\nJORAH: Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift.\n\nTYRION (O.S.): It s true. He has.\n\nTyrion enters the pit.\n\nDAENERYS: Who are you?\n\nTYRION: I am the gift. It s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister.\n\nCut to Dany in shock and deep thought after hearing his name.\n\nINT. KING S LANDING - BLACK CELL\n\nCersei enters Margaery s cell.\n\nCERSEI: This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It s quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind.\n\nMARGAERY: I know you did this.\n\nCERSEI: We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.\n\nMARGAERY: Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You re not very good at those, I m afraid. Perhaps that s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me.\n\nCERSEI: You re upset. You re not thinking clearly. I ll visit again when you ve had a chance to calm down.\n\nMARGAERY: I don t want to see you again.\n\nCERSEI: I do hope you change your mind about that. I ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins.\n\nMARGAERY: Leave.\n\nCERSEI: Yes, I m afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever.\n\nMargaery throws the medicine at Cersei.\n\nMARGAERY: Get out you hateful bitch!\n\nCERSEI: Sleep well, sister.\n\nCersei walks out smiling. She is taken to High Septon s room by a Sparrow.\n\nINT. GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL\n\nHIGH SPARROW (to Sparrow): Thank you. (to Cersei) You saw her?\n\nCERSEI: Yes.\n\nSPARROW: And?\n\nCERSEI: Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?\n\nSPARROW: Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.\n\nCERSEI: Who will stand judge?\n\nSPARROW: Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.\n\nCERSEI: Will you be one of them?\n\nSPARROW: I will.\n\nCERSEI: If one or both of them were to confess before the trial \n\nSPARROW: Then they will be at The Mother s mercy.\n\nCERSEI: What does The Mother s mercy entail?\n\nSPARROW: It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.\n\nCERSEI: Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.\n\nSPARROW: Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King s Landing?\n\nCERSEI: I think I may have heard at one point.\n\nSPARROW: Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.\n\nThe High Septon gestures to a stone altar with seven-pointed stars engraved into it.\n\nSPARROW: Who carved this altar do you know?\n\nCERSEI: I m afraid i don t.\n\nSPARROW: No one does. There s no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.\n\nStrip away the gold and the ornaments, knock down the statues and the pillars, and this is what remains. Something simple, solid, and true. The Tyrell s finery will be stripped away. Their lives knocked down, their true hearts laid bare for all to see. And so it will be for all of us, high and low alike. What will we find when we strip away your finery?\n\nThe High Septon stares intently at Cersei.\n\nSPARROW: A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird.\n\nCersei gives a faint laugh.\n\nSPARROW: And he has much to say about you.\n\nLancell enters the room and stands next to the High Septon. Cersei goes for the door and is blocked.\n\nCERSEI: Move. Let me go immediately.\n\nCersei is grabbed and carried away from the room.\n\nCERSEI (O.S.): You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy  I am the queen! Let me go!\n\nINT. BLACK CELL\n\nCersei is thrown into the cell. She looks up at the people who put her there.\n\nCERSEI: Look at me. Look at my face. It s the last thing you ll see before you die.\n\nThe door slams closed and is bolted shut.\n\nEND EPISODE\n\n"}
