Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.)\nIt\u2019s hard not to watch these first two episodes of Game Of Thrones\u2019 third season and just get exhausted. There are so many characters to check in with and so many new ones being thrown at us. Everyone\u2019s trudging around from place to place, only a vague destination in mind, barely a horse between them to cover any distance. \u201cDark Wings, Dark Words\u201d spent a lot of time with characters on the run and in hiding, staying off the beaten path to avoid detection, and as a result, it\u2019s a very tense hour that on the surface lacks forward momentum, although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s tipping many a larger plot into motion.\nWe\u2019re mostly seeing characters there wasn\u2019t time for last week, and there\u2019s a lot more time spent up north, with no time spent across the sea. (I guess we\u2019ll hear more from Barristan Selmy next time.) There\u2019s only a brief glimpse of Jon after last week, but it\u2019s an important one since it solidifies the concept of a \u201cwarg,\u201d which his brother Bran certainly is\u2014someone who can see through the eyes of animals. This particular fellow is played by Mackenzie Crook (Gareth from the UK Office) and his appearance gives Ygritte another chance to make fun of Jon for not knowing about something. That\u2019s getting a little old, lady.\nBut we spend plenty of time with our favorite warg, little Bran, who is not so little anymore. Isaac Hempstead-Wright had to start growing up sometime, so he doesn\u2019t have quite his beautiful boyish face anymore, but no matter, I can suspend my disbelief. Bran is still on the run with Hodor, brother Rickon, and the immensely useful Osha, although I don\u2019t even really remember what they\u2019re supposed to be heading toward. Just away from the burning wreck of Winterfell, I suppose. Anyway, Osha\u2019s very useful with a blade, but we\u2019re two seasons deep, and it\u2019s time to start figuring out just what is up with Bran. He\u2019s been having these crazy crow dreams pretty much since the start of the show, and I\u2019d like a little progress on that front.\nSo in comes Jojen (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and his sister Meera (Ellie Kendrick), two northern kids who are a bit grimier than Bran, although their father was apparently an old ally of Ned\u2019s. Jojen is presented as very savvy and possessing the same possibly psychic powers of Bran, but there\u2019s another thing he has in common with his new friend\u2014he\u2019s a bit of a weakling, letting his more-capable sister Meera handle the weapons. Osha tries to dig at him about this, but Meera is very chipper about their arrangement, one that somewhat mirrors Bran and Osha\u2019s (or, in a happier world, Bran and Arya\u2019s), although Bran is in much worse shape than Jojen.\nThere\u2019s not much else going on yet, but Jojen does identify the three-eyed crow as Bran himself, saying he\u2019s seeing things going on in the past, the present, and possibly the future (we even hear a snippet of Ned\u2019s voice in one of the dreams). Typical seer stuff\u2014too vague to box the writers into a corner, and expansive enough to leave all kinds of creepy dreams and visions open to us in the future. Bran is the character whose ultimate agenda is the most shrouded in mystery, but at least I\u2019m glad he has a friend his age now.\nWhile Bran is a fugitive on the run, Arya remains in worse shape, barely out of the frying pan before she\u2019s right back in the fire. Gendry and Hot Pie are (quite reasonably) complaining that she should have had Jaqen kill someone like Joffrey with his magic assassin powers, even though they owe their lives to her quick thinking, and quickly they run into a whole host of misfits\u2014the Brotherhood Without Banners, whom we heard plenty about last season. They\u2019re some sort of band of rebellious rascals who were making trouble for Tywin and the Mountain up north and are led by Thoros, played by Paul Kaye (an English comedian of fair renown, especially when I was growing up there in the mid-90s). He\u2019s nice and shifty, though\u2014seemingly friendly, not entirely trustworthy, and probably the nicest sort Arya has met on her journey so far, but not above shaming her swordsmanship skills when she challenges him.\nA lot of this season is obviously going to be about whom to trust. Every character has been so badly burned by whatever alliances they\u2019ve tried to make and seen honorable souls like Ned put on the chopping block for playing by the old rules. No sooner does Arya go along with the Brotherhood than they bring in another captive, the Hound (I\u2019ve missed him!), who immediately recognizes her, and then her goose is cooked. Or is it? Put it this way, I don\u2019t see her getting to Riverrun anytime soon.\nSansa is in an even more delicate, frightening position, even though her cage is gilded. She\u2019s free of Joffrey\u2019s immediate, horrible attention but still far too frightened to do much of anything, and her scene with the Tyrell women (Margaery and her grandmother Olenna, played by British icon Diana Rigg) is probably the most fascinating to watch this week, because we really don\u2019t know whom to trust there. Olenna keeps it plenty real, dissing her dumb son (Margaery\u2019s dad) for his political gamesmanship and Renly for his peacocking, then imperiously demanding cheese from terrified-looking waiters. Margaery keeps up the sweet innocent act, but we know there\u2019s more to her than this. She\u2019s not just being forced into this marriage as part of a political alliance. As she told Petyr, she wants to be the Queen, and she\u2019s not above dealing with Joffrey to win her prize.\nBut that doesn\u2019t make Margaery evil, either\u2014just smart. It\u2019s why she\u2019s the most fascinating character to watch so far this season. She\u2019s not dementedly evil like Joffrey, she doesn\u2019t have Cersei\u2019s cold, jealous streak, and she is not a gleeful operator like Petyr or Varys (where is he, by the way?). Her motives are somewhat craven, but you also get the sense that she won\u2019t just toss Sansa under the bus for saying Joffrey\u2019s a monster (which they really have to drag out of her). Now, she might do that if she had to, but in a world of game-players Margaery is another, specific breed. Combined with Olenna, it\u2019s clear the Tyrells will be quite formidable. Still, it's stomach-churning to watch her play up to Joffrey\u2019s lame crossbow display, although there is some satisfaction in seeing her mind games work on a whole other level compared to Cersei (who ham-fistedly tries to plant seeds of doubt against Margaery earlier on).\nWhile Margaery\u2019s scheming is the most intriguing to watch, the continuing adventures of Jaime and Brienne are probably the most fun because they are just the oddest couple and the show knows it. It\u2019s impossible to imagine now, but you just know these two are going to be buddies (at the very least) by the time this trip is over. The formula simply demands it! She\u2019s a pious, well-meaning, stiff lady. He\u2019s a nasty, privileged, nihilistic dude. They both like to kill things with swords, although for very different reasons. Brienne is all about honor, from start to finish\u2014apart from love of Renly, it\u2019s hard to tell what else motivates her. Jaime is all about vanity, and his swordsmanship is the ultimate example of that. Every time he beats a dude or kills a dude, he\u2019s verifying that he\u2019s better than anyone else, which is just grand.\nAt the same time, Jaime is kind of like the Comedian in Watchmen. (Have I made that comparison before? Apologies if I have.) He cares little for honor, for the Lannister name, for anything except for kicking ass and having sex with his sister (which he hasn\u2019t been able to do for quite a while at this point). In a society very bound by codes and protocol, he\u2019s kind of a breath of fresh air in how utterly disinterested he is about it. I especially loved him in season one where you could tell all he wanted to do was throw down with Ned and everyone else and settle all his disputes that way. He\u2019s not a man made for peacetime.\nJaime is due a rude awakening, and it\u2019s going to be fun watching it happen. Step one comes here, where he manages to free himself and grab a sword from Brienne but is handily beaten by her in a duel on a bridge. Now, of course, he\u2019s fighting in a fairly diminished state, and Brienne has already proven herself quite the warrior, but it\u2019s obviously a crushing moment for him, followed up by the unfortunate appearance of Noah Taylor, who I\u2019m sure only brings trouble with him. Noah Taylor always signifies trouble.\nI can\u2019t leave before mentioning the character in the biggest trouble of all, though\u2014poor old Theon. He\u2019s being tortured by\u2026 someone, in horrible, crucifying detail, while being asked for information he obviously doesn\u2019t have. His tormentors want to know why he captured Winterfell and left it in ruin, and Theon will happily tell them whatever he thinks they want to hear, but we know the truth\u2014daddy issues, plain and simple. Poor guy. I hope next week Alfie Allen spends at least a little time off the rack.\n", "episode_28": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.\u201cProtection\u201d can be a dirty word in our modern world. To protect another is a kind sentiment and a noble desire, but it can also the worst sort of condescension. Protection is something that should be asked for, not given. It implies a certain type of powerlessness: Anointing yourself someone else\u2019s protector suggests they couldn\u2019t accomplish the job themselves. This isn\u2019t to discount any and all instances of proactive, precautionary protection. Some people, some creatures, some ideals require such actions in the face of a threat. But when that threat is presumed\u2014or worse, wholly imagined\u2014such defensive impulses can be downright ugly.This week, the Game Of Thrones\u00a0is a game of defense.\u00a0\u201cProtect\u201d or \u201cprotection\u201d or any number of other synonyms is uttered by several characters populating David Benioff and D.B. Weiss\u2019 script, and it\u2019s a sign of the wide world fostered by the showrunners that \u201cBreaker Of Chains\u201d gives the word so many facets. It grants a Darwinian angle to The Hound\u2019s decision to rob the farmer: \u201cHe\u2019s weak. He can\u2019t protect himself. They\u2019ll both be dead come winter. Dead men don\u2019t need silver.\u201d For Sam, it\u2019s the patronizing, paternal notion that Gilly is in danger if she stays at Castle Black. To Sam\u2019s fellow members of the Night\u2019s Watch, protecting the people and the land behind The Wall is a duty and a calling. Notice that the characters most committed to protection are the big, burly men with swords at their sides.Elsewhere in Westeros, alternate means of protection are employed by characters who fancy themselves smarter than the average warrior. Tywin insulates his daughter\u2019s fragile emotional state by talking around Joffrey\u2019s failures as a king, a great monologue and a spectacular performance by Charles Dance that Alex Graves frames as a one-sided conversation with Cersei by focusing the camera on Lena Headey\u2014even though Tywin is technically lecturing king-to-be Tommen. In a \u201clike father, like son\u201d display that Tywin would likely deny, Tyrion takes similarly indirect steps toward assuring Podrick\u2019s survival. And then there\u2019s Dany The Great Liberator, sounding ever more the politician as she denies Grey Worm, Barristan, and Jorah their requests to fight as her\u00a0\u201cchampion\u201d (itself a protector\u2019s role) then lays a stirring bit of speechifying on the enslaved people of Meereen. There\u2019s a real presentational edge to these addresses and Tywin\u2019s \u201cWhat makes a good king?\u201d talk. In a time of chaos, when the power vacuum that Joffrey seemingly sealed has been violently re-opened, those who believe they\u2019re fittest to lead are getting their stump speeches in order.In a time of chaos, when kings and pretenders to the throne die at random, when wedding feasts become executions, the natural inclination is to seek security. After \u201cprotection,\u201d \u201cBreaker Of Chains\u201d\u2019 other refrain is \u201csafe,\u201d as in Littlefinger telling Sansa\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re safe with me, sailing home\u201d or the farmer\u2019s nostalgia for the Riverlands of House Tully\u2019s reign:\u00a0\u201cWe were safe.\u201dAnd the violation of such safety is the most horrific part of the sin Jaime Lannister commits beside his son\u2019s corpse.Of course, Jaime\u2019s rape of Cersei is 100 percent horrific, a bizarre turn of events that I understand is presented as a consensual encounter in the books. I\u2019ll leave the larger, show-wide implications of the act to the Sonia Saraiya-penned For Our Consideration essay that it inspired (and which is posting at midnight); at the micro level, it\u2019s an odd pockmark on an otherwise spotless episode. The attraction between the Lannister twins is a complicated issue, one the show could conveniently set aside when Jaime was away from the capital. But now that he\u2019s returned, it gives\u00a0Game Of Thrones another source of tension to play with, even if it\u2019s one that always feels designed to shock, rather than to illuminate some inner truth about Cersei or Jaime or the world in which they live.And that\u2019s my main beef with the rape scene in \u201cBreaker Of Chains.\u201d It\u2019s a gasp-inducing moment, but the gasp is largely empty. If it\u2019s meant to be a \u201cwhen it rains, it pours\u201d situation for Cersei, surely there was a less repugnant way of achieving that goal. If it\u2019s meant to restore some of the villainous shading Jaime lost during his walkabout with Brienne, it comes on much too quickly. If it\u2019s meant to be an expression of grief\u2014God, I really hope it\u2019s not meant to be an expression of grief.How I\u2019m choosing to view it, the perspective from which it does the least harm to the best hour of season four to date, is as a wrongheaded expression of power. \u201cWrongheaded\u201d here is relative: Everything about the way Jaime feels about Cersei (and vice versa) is wrong. They\u2019re brother and sister, and their incestuous bond created the monster who now lies dead in the sept. And there was nothing that Jaime Lannister, maimed Kingslayer, could\u2019ve done to prevent that death. So now he seizes the opportunity to harness the one emotion he\u2019s never been able to control, doing so by cruel, barbaric, hateful methods.\u00a0It\u2019s important that \u201cBreaker Of Chains\u201d in no way condones the act, Graves\u2019 blocking and cinematography purposefully avoiding any sort of erotic charge. Compare it to Oberyn and Ellaria\u2019s visit to the brothel in this episode\u2014or any previous Game Of Thrones\u00a0sex scene, really\u2014and notice the care that\u2019s been taken to portray the pure evil of Jaime\u2019s attempt to feel like the \u201cJaime Lannister\u201d of myth yet again. But the matter-of-fact presentation works against the sequence, in a way, its plainness mutating and gnarling into a different form of gratuitousness. And then to move on, so swiftly, leaving any consideration of the fallout for next week\u2014it\u2019s an odd, off-putting choice, but I have a feeling it could\u2019ve been much worse.That scene is\u00a0\u201cBreaker Of Chains\u201d\u2019 only serious bungling of its primary themes. After the progress reports that formed most of the last\u00a0two episodes, this is the first hour of season four to feel like it\u2019s feeding and telling a larger story, one that monitors the ripples of major events in Westeros while using the show\u2019s vast setting to illustrate the way a cast of dozens can put many spins on a universal notion. Human beings want protection, they want to feel secure and able to go about their lives. When that protection is forced upon us, it\u2019s terribly uncomfortable\u2014particularly when it\u2019s separated from any sort of perceivable threat. Heartbreaking as the episode\u2019s\u00a0Gilly-Sam scenes are, Hannah Murray does excellent work expressing the quiet anguish of being shunted away\u00a0\u201cfor her own good,\u201d Sam blind to the fact that her new home isn\u2019t exactly a suite at the Ritz. The people who love us shouldn\u2019t hurt us this way; the people who love us should respect our wishes, should know what the words\u00a0\u201cno\u201d and\u00a0\u201cstop\u201d mean.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0But there are threats in Westeros\u2014on many fronts, taking many forms.\u00a0\u201cBreaker Of Chains\u201d excels at reinforcing the current state of imbalance in this world, an entropy that Tywin now openly catalogues while offering Oberyn spots on Tyrion\u2019s jury and within the small council:\u00a0\u201cThe king is dead, the Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the wall\u2014and in the east, a Targaryen girl has three dragons.\u201d Arrows abruptly fly into view several times during tonight\u2019s episode, heightening the sense that danger waits just out of view. Chickens also wander into frame on separate occasions\u2014first when Arya is awoken by a robbery, second when Styr captures the young boy he sends to Castle Black\u2014neither one letting off any sort of warning that foxes have arrived in the barnyard. Not that they need to: The growing legions of the dead should be enough to indicate that any sense of safety projected at the beginning of the season was just an illusion. Forget protecting anyone else: With the Free Folk on the move, everyone on Game Of Thrones\u00a0ought to be more concerned with self-preservation. At the very least, they might want to take some archery lessons.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "episode_29": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.His grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, first of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, is dead. The exact cause of death is unknown, but early evidence indicates poisoning. He was 19. He will be mourned by no one.That\u2019s not strictly true: Considering the anguish on Lena Headey\u2019s face and the way Jamie rushes through the confused masses of wedding guests, the boy\u2019s family will grieve. They had the Seven Kingdoms on a platter, but an act of betrayal on a day that was all about them took that away. Judging by Cersei\u2019s behavior in her final moments as queen regent, she weeps for the loss of power almost as much as cries for the death of her son.It\u2019s in the real world where Joffrey\u2019s death will inspire no requiems. One of the most hated figures in recent television history has kicked the bucket, at the end of an episode that\u2019s a greatest-hits compilation of his cruelest deeds.\u00a0\u201cThe Lion And The Rose\u201d is one of those Game Of Thrones episodes that had me thinking\u00a0\u201cGod, when is this kid going to do us all a favor and\u00a0die\u00a0already?\u201d 15 minutes in\u2014to the point that I thought he was faking it when he grasped his throat in the international sign for \u201cAn entire television audience\u2019s wish has been granted.\u201d Surely, there can\u2019t be justice in the final five minutes of an hour in which Jack Gleeson\u2019s character takes a sword to Tyrion\u2019s wedding gift, forces his uncle to play cup bearer, and\u00a0stages the most inappropriate garden-party entertainment since Roger Sterling\u2019s 1963 Kentucky Derby shindig. The choking bit has to be his latest act of barbaric bullshit.But then Gleeson spits a glob of goo onto the ground (top-notch work this week, props department!), and the truth of the matter sinks in. In that moment, I remembered why Game Of Thrones weddings are to be feared, not celebrated. And that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m worried about with regard to \u201cThe Lion And The Rose\u201d: That a tremendous cheer will rise up from within the viewership of this show, prompted by the death of a loathsome product of George R.R. Martin\u2019s imagination. (This episode is the fourth in the series whose script was written by Martin. Notably, he also wrote season two\u2019s \u201cBlackwater.\u201d\u00a0So there\u2019s a second portent to watch out for in future episodes: a ceremony celebrating love and fidelity and \u201cwritten for television by George R.R. Martin.\u201d) That\u2019s what makes the shots of Cersei\u2019s distress so important, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so crucial that the camera holds on Gleeson\u2019s face until the life goes out of Joffrey\u2019s eyes. In a world where life is increasingly cheap, the viewers must be wary of schadenfreude. King Joffrey is dead, long rot in shit and die a million deaths for eternity King Joffrey\u2014but to actively revel in this plot point is to be no better than the horrific boy king himself.I know this is unavoidable. I know that I\u2019ll wake up tomorrow to social networks choked with headlines like\u00a0\u201cTwitter\u2019s best reactions to Joffrey\u2019s death\u201d and \u201cJoffrey\u2019s death in 7 GIFs\u201d and \u201cWhich viscous substance pouring out of Joffrey\u2019s face are you? (POLL).\u201d But I deeply, sincerely wish that I wouldn\u2019t, because that\u2019s giving in to the basest, least human elements of a very good piece of television.\u00a0\u201cThe Lion And The Rose\u201d isn\u2019t good TV because it\u2019s\u00a0\u201cThe One Where Joffrey Finally Gets What\u2019s Coming To Him, That Little Prick.\u201d It\u2019s good TV because the episode builds to that moment, with tiny choices made by Tyrion and Joffrey finally hitting the fan when the boy king hits the floor. It\u2019s good TV because it sustains tension in the King\u2019s Landing storyline even as the show does the season-premiere catch-up dance with characters we didn\u2019t see last week. Season four is still revving up its engine for most of the hour, and I have to believe it hasn\u2019t shown us the best stuff yet. Because, c\u2019mon: If this is the season in which Joffrey dies two episodes in, what else might be in store?Besides: It\u2019s not like Game Of Thrones\u00a0to vanquish one monster without another being around to take his place. Rising up from the muck and the mire of last season\u2019s most grueling story thread, Ramsay Snow bursts onto the scene with an archer in tow and an unarmed waif in his sights. Young Ramsay hasn\u2019t had much in the way of a change of heart since last we saw him, and his surroundings at Dreadfort remain the show\u2019s dankest this side of Harrenhal. Someone who has changed is Theon Greyjoy, now answering to Reek and requiring a great deal more trembling from Alfie Allen. It\u2019s tough to see him like this\u2014a lot of \u201cThe Lion And Rose\u201d is tough to watch, but it beats all of those torture scenes from season three.\u00a0The tortures being executed by the two tyrants on either side of the episode are psychological this time around, as Joffrey toys with his uncle and Ramsay dangles his control of Reek in front of his skeptical father. These two portrayals of madness are similar, but they\u2019re distinguished through presentation. In the airy, well-appointed settings of King\u2019s Landing, surrounded by monuments and bathed in sunlight, Joffrey\u2019s unreasonable commands are granted an air of petulance, his severity a result of supreme spoiling. Drop that kind of behavior into Dreadfort, however, and it\u2019s a whole new kind of crazy. It\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019re more accustomed to as viewers, and I think that has to be part of the reason Joffrey is so widely detested while Ramsay could be lumped in with the show\u2019s second-tier villains. Both are wicked and inhumane, but the former is wicked and inhumane from a place of extreme privilege, and that puts a larger target on his back. Yet it\u2019s important to note that the shaving scene at Dreadfort lacks for no tension when compared to the\u00a0\u201ckneel\u201d exchange between Joffrey and Tyrion. Ramsay hasn\u2019t earned the vitriol that Joffrey did, but he\u2019s still capable of creating white-knuckle scenes like this one. (Credit due to director Alex Graves for framing\u00a0Iwan Rheon in such a vulnerable position, with what little light there is in that set glinting off of the razor blade in Reek\u2019s hand.)\u00a0Because if there\u2019s one thing I can comfortably say I enjoyed about tonight\u2019s big finish, it was the final face-off between Joffrey and Tyrion. It doesn\u2019t matter who did what to whatever ended Joffrey\u2019s life (there\u2019s still a lot of ambiguity there)\u2014that he dies thinking his uncle is responsible is the best kind of revenge. The wedding feast turns into a torture chamber for Tyrion and Sansa, the pantomime war aimed nastily, specifically in their direction. The thing is, Joffrey needn\u2019t have bothered: Tyrion\u2019s been laid so low by the most recent events regarding Shae that the festivities of the feast merely adds insult to injury. The most damning evidence in the case against Tyrion might be that he just had to send his true love across the narrow sea; motive can be read into that move, as well as a desire to protect Shae from the consequences of a plot to kill the king. But I don\u2019t want to delve too deeply into\u00a0\u201cWho killed Joffrey?\u201d detective work. I\u2019m sure much of the non-Song Of Fire And Ice-reading world will devote the coming days to puzzling that mystery out\u2014besides, the scenes leading up to the death give Game Of Thrones\u00a0its own\u00a0\u201cWho Shot Mr. Burns?\u201d\u00a0in the way suspects and motivation flit in and out of view before the deed is done.And yet I keep coming back to the\u00a0\u201ckneel\u201d exchange, the last moment like that we\u2019ll ever get between Gleeson and Peter Dinklage. It\u2019s shot for maximum humiliation on Tyrion\u2019s part, the camera placed at Dinklage\u2019s shoulder level, glaring up at Joffrey\u2019s awful face in reluctant deference. It\u2019s an evident breaking point, and even if Tyrion isn\u2019t Joffrey\u2019s killer, the boy died because he spent his life treating other people like this. It comes together marvelously, and if there\u2019s anything to celebrate about \u201cThe Lion And The Rose,\u201d it\u2019s filmmaking like this. (It\u2019s also a spotlight moment for Ramin Djawadi\u2019s \u201cLion And The Rose\u201d score, an ominous drone billowing into the spaces between the dialogue.) When the camera later sweeps upward to Tyrion on the elevated platform, it instantly changes the tone of the proceedings. What was a celebration for one person (and an annoyance for the other guests) has turned into a trial for another. It is a line in the sand, the true beginning of Game Of Thrones\u2019 fourth season. The revelry in the \u201cpeace\u201d brought about by Tywin\u2019s war is at an end. The wedding is over; let the funeral begin.", "episode_38": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of  view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.)\n\u201cYou\u2019re nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain\u2019t here.\u201d\nThere\u2019s too much going on in any one Game Of Thrones episode for there to always be a grand, unifying theme\u2014too much serialized story to get through, too much background info to unpack. But the closing lines of the episode, delivered by Locke (Noah Taylor) to poor, poor Jaime (whoever thought I\u2019d be typing that?) definitely have a profound ring to them.\nIf the first two episodes felt like a lot of setup (and they did) we are now just starting to bite into the meat of season three. The map has been updated to include Riverrun, ancestral home to Catelyn Stark, where she goes to attend her father\u2019s funeral, and that whole experience just screams \u201cYou\u2019re nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain\u2019t here\u201d to her and Robb.\nCatelyn\u2019s brother, who\u2019s now in charge of everything, is called Edmure and is played by Tobias Menzies (who I remember best as Brutus in Rome) and is a bit of a preening idiot. He\u2019s been leading his men on worthless military missions against Robb\u2019s orders, but as we learn from an incredibly symbolic first scene, he can\u2019t even shoot the ceremonial flaming arrow in his father\u2019s Viking funeral and will obviously remain an ineffective headache for Catelyn and her son.\nHe does have a terrific uncle called Brynden the Blackfish (British character actor Clive Russell) who is every bit and grizzled and bullshit-free as Edmure is not (he\u2019s the one who eventually lands the flaming arrow). He has another in what\u2019s becoming a scene of very nice, well-acted, melancholy Catelyn scenes where she reminisces on waiting for her father to return to the castle as a child, and fears that Bran and Rickon did the same to no avail with her. It doesn\u2019t quite have the fearsome power of her monologue the week before about wanting baby Jon Snow dead, but the show is doing a great job keeping her relevant even though she\u2019s not really part of the action right now.\nThe Stark children certainly miss their daddy but it\u2019s too much to say they\u2019re nothing without them; it is amazing how Ned\u2019s strength of character continues to echo through the show more than a season after his death, especially in Arya\u2019s defiant leadership of her little band of misfits, and Bran\u2019s ethereal connection to the ghosts of the past (no appearance by him this week though).\nArya only gets one big scene this week but it\u2019s a very sweet one, as she and Gendry bid goodbye to Hot Pie who is taken on as a baker\u2019s apprentice at the inn the Brotherhood Without Banners has led them to. It\u2019s an amazing full-circle moment since this is the same inn where the Hound casually slew the baker\u2019s boy for being an innocent bystander to the wolf attack on Joffrey; that was her major loss of innocence moment, but now she has a chance to reverse it (in a weird way) with the Hound a captive of the Brotherhood\u2019s and Hot Pie replacing poor Mycah. He bakes Arya a little bread wolf to bid goodbye and the whole thing is so darn adolescent and cute I just can\u2019t stand it.\nTyrion and Cersei do have their dad still around, lucky them, and the extent of their power-playing is summed up in that wonderful opening scene where the two of them craftily arrange their chairs around the new Small Council table, a beautiful mix of silent comedy and bristling tension. Tyrion is now master of coin (Littlefinger\u2019s old position), which leads him to quickly realize that Petyr\u2019s main approach to raising money has been borrowing extreme quantities of it. This is all interesting enough, but then we get bogged down in a weird, irrelevant-feeling storyline about Pod the squire\u2019s insane properties in the bedroom, which\u2026what? This had better have a bearing on some future episode because here it felt like a waste of my valuable time.\nDaenerys doesn\u2019t do a ton this episode but it feels like she\u2019s setting up some gigantic power play, promising the slaver one of her dragons in exchange for all 8,000 Unsullied soldiers, all the trainees and Missandei the translator slave, who she quizzes about the extent of the soldiers\u2019 training. So far Barristan\u2019s role appears to be as a counter-balance to Jorah; he gives similarly weighty advice, but tinged with more respect for honor and the past. Unsurprising, since he was a golden knight and Jorah is a disgraced former slaver himself. All their scenes together had a feeling of \u201cwatch this space,\u201d however.\nThe most engaging and gripping material of the night comes in Jaime and Brienne\u2019s storyline, which has sadly switched from fun odd couple buddy movie to creepy torture experience (yet another one, considering we\u2019re also suffering through Theon\u2019s confusing captive state). Locke and his buddies supposedly work for Roose Bolton, an ally of Robb\u2019s, but I get the impression they\u2019re playing by their own rules. Jaime, obviously, has to be delivered alive, but Brienne is in real trouble, being both a woman and a prisoner of no importance.\nThe two have a disturbing exchange near the start of the episode about Brienne\u2019s likely fate: if not death, certainly sexual assault and brutalization, especially if she resists. Jaime advises her to lie back and take it, essentially, but he\u2019s giving this horrible advice in his typical, cold-blooded Jaime way\u2014he\u2019s considered all the eventualities coldly and decided that\u2019s the least torturous. Of course, Brienne will fight back, given that she\u2019s a woman of honor and considerable strength, and Jaime intimates that he understands. \u201cIf I was a woman, I\u2019d make them kill me. I\u2019m not, thank the gods.\u201d\nBut it all shakes down rather surprisingly, with two final-act twists: one that was a little cheesy, utterly necessary and vital for Jaime\u2019s development, and one that was truly shocking in that holy shit Game Of Thrones way where it smash-cuts to black and credits and you vainly scream for more, more, more.\nJaime tells Locke that Brienne is also a valuable prisoner, from the rich \u201cSapphire Isles\u201d ruled by Lord Tarth, and is worth a fortune if delivered with her honor unbesmirched. He has no real reason to spare her except compassion, a quality Jaime has certainly lacked until now. It\u2019s an obvious development but, as I said, a necessary one with intriguing implications for the future.\nWhat else has intriguing implications for the future? What about Jaime\u2019s hand getting CUT THE FUCK OFF in the closing seconds of the episode, as he tries to finagle his way out of his chains in his typical sneaky way and quickly realizes he\u2019s dealing with a different kettle of psycho-fish. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain\u2019t here,\u201d Locke says. Which has a ring of truth to it, but more importantly, Jaime is nothing without his sword hand. To repeat: holy shit.\n", "episode_22": "\nThe worst part of \u201cThe Watchers On The Wall\u201d is that it doesn\u2019t really end. I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going, so I can\u2019t rely on the Snow-Rayder Peace Accords to make this episode feel like it actually comes to a conclusion when all that really happens is day breaks. Contra the producers, just killing a bunch of people doesn\u2019t necessarily give an episode a sense of resolution. Is Alliser alive? Do the men know about Slynt? How many crows are left? This isn\u2019t Yara\u2019s assault on the Dreadfort, but it\u2019d be nice to see the show live up to its own hype in this season\u2014where Joffrey finally gets taken down but in a hands-free murder, and Prince Oberyn finally gets his confession and then gets popped. These are all very different grades of let-down\u2014Oberyn\u2019s death is a case of \u201cfool me four times or so,\u201d and Joffrey\u2019s murder is satisfying even without the direct vengeance. The battle at the wall isn\u2019t a disappointment at all, but it\u2019s cracked up to be 100,000 wildlings vs. 102 crows and a direwolf and the best little archer from some hamlet on the south side. And it is for the most part, but eventually it just hits low tide. This show is in a perpetual state of \u201cto be continued.\u201dBut like I said, this ain\u2019t the Dreadfort. This is the most sustained battle episode in the series to date. Like \u201cBlackwater\u201d (or episode director Neil Marshall\u2019s historical war movies like Centurion), \u201cThe Watchers On The Wall\u201d has an exciting rhythm, alternating furious action with slower moments, conducting the different sections of the fight like an orchestra\u2014only here that means a break to see mammoths and giants methodically prepare to tow the outer gate, instead of a drop-in with Cersei and the girls. In one shot Marshall and/or the visual effects team smoothly map out the geography: Beginning with Ygritte\u2019s camp south of the wall, the camera moves up over the ledge to Castle Black, then up the Wall to the crows on top, and finally over it to reveal the biggest fire the North has ever seen and its implied army in the six digits.Marshall\u2019s camerawork is so much more pointed than the dizzying dancing of \u201cThe Mountain And The Viper.\u201d The way the camera finds Ygritte in the action and recoils trying to train on her vividly mirrors Ygritte drawing an arrow and trying to find a target. It\u2019s almost certainly written into the script, but it\u2019s so like Marshall\u2014so violently, blackly comic\u2014to see the front line of wildlings roaring all, \u201cYou missed me!\u201d and then dropping one by one. In the aftermath of the giant scythe swiping all the climbers off the Wall in one fell swoop, there\u2019s a similarly toned shot of a hand hanging from the wall with no body attached. This isn\u2019t fight coverage. This is sharp, splashy action.\u201cBlackwater\u201d draws on more history, but \u201cThe Watchers On The Wall\u201d has so much more warfare. It begins with the warging and the fire and those blaring horns, the sound quavering like that harmonica siren in Once Upon A Time In The West. The mammoths and giants go for the gates, and the southern wildlings loose their arrows on the gates of Castle Black. The men in the castle drop rocks on the attackers below, and the men atop the wall drop exploding barrels on theirs. There are pulleys to turn the archers parallel to the ground so they can get better shots at the climbers. In the castle there\u2019s Sam loading Pyp\u2019s crossbow and Olly manning the elevator. The geography is so clear that at one point Tormund barrels down the hall and Pyp and Sam pop out of some stairs on the other side. Gilly\u2019s locked away in some room behind the forge where Jon and Ygritte face off. Gilly\u2019s soon joined by Janos Slynt, who bears out Tyrion\u2019s final words before he sent Janos to the wall: \u201cI\u2019m not questioning your honor, Lord Slynt. I\u2019m denying its very existence.\u201dIt\u2019s also a lot like \u201cBlackwater\u201d in its battle-movie tropes: The quiet hopelessness beforehand, the long-standing castles now finally on the brink of defeat, the surprising personal victories. Janos retreats like Joffrey and holes up with Gilly like The Hound and Sansa. One big difference between the episodes is how complicated the relationships at King\u2019s Landing are. Here we just have star-crossed Jon and Ygritte, chivalrous Sam and Gilly, the Alliser-Jon feud, and a bunch of soldiers who respect Jon. Even where there\u2019s tension (Jon/Ygritte, Jon/Alliser), there\u2019s really only one way things can go. In the case of Alliser, duty trounces personal animosity, and in the case of Ygritte, narrative convention trounces the fact that Rose Leslie is approximately 1,000 times more interesting than Kit Harington. So there isn\u2019t a lot of specific dramatic meat, but like Sam says, when the stakes are life and death, you\u2019re nobody or anybody. Pyp\u2019s backstory doesn\u2019t matter when he\u2019s never wielded a weapon and he\u2019s charged with manning the gates at Castle Black. Doesn\u2019t take much to feel for whomever gets put in that position.That said, this is Ser Alliser Thorne\u2019s best episode. Who knew he had other expressions than smirk and glare? I could hardly believe that he admitted Jon\u2019s plan was better before the battle. And then he has this human bit about what leadership is, getting second-guessed by every clever, little twat in your command. I\u2019m still stunned to see Alliser open up like this, but it makes sense. In the face of certain doom, a grudge just seems silly. So does his \u201crationale\u201d for laughing off Jon\u2019s plan, mind you, and just because it\u2019s humanizing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s actual leadership. He didn\u2019t shut Jon down out of faith in his own battle preparations. He shut Jon down because he can\u2019t stand him. Still, after four seasons of Alliser being a pain in everyone\u2019s neck, it\u2019s comforting to see him rally his brothers and hold his own. He\u2019s got nothing on Tyrion (\u201cThose are brave men knocking at our door. Let\u2019s go kill them.\u201d), but \u201cDo you plan to die tonight? That\u2019s very good to hear,\u201d certainly swept me up in the action. Most everyone else with a name gets a good scene or two, too. Sam equivocates on his chastity vows and curses for the first time, while Jon gets to show weariness, which is a different flavor of boring from usual. It\u2019s been a long time since Sam and Jon have felt this alive, if ever. Forgive me\u2014the scenes at the Wall are such a slow-drip it\u2019s hard to keep up sometimes. Did we know Maester Aemon was a Targaryen? The identity of his one true love is set up like a tantalizing mystery, but really he offers some wit and counsel (\u201cImagine the stories they tell about us\u201d). Pyp gets to play rookie and Grenn gets to play obedient soldier and both get to play dead at the end. It hurts to see them go as two of Jon\u2019s most loyal allies, as two characters who have been around for four years, as two soldiers who bravely fulfilled their duties. On the other hand, it feels a little easy, like these characters were created so that they could die here tonight. Jon and Sam are safe, or feel safe anyway. If either of them had died, that would have been Game Of Thrones subverting conventions. This is another \u201cBlackwater,\u201d where the underlings die and the characters that actually matter are untouchable. Witness Sam loading a crossbow and firing it just in time as he scrambles across a battlefield otherwise unnoticed.Ygritte was destined for this in a subtler way. She was determined to find Jon, but it\u2019s clear she wouldn\u2019t be able to kill him. And he can\u2019t die, because he\u2019s the boring, old hero. Maybe defecting was an option, but it feels like her fate is sealed from the get-go. The longer she waits, the bigger the target on her back. The fact that her arrow came from Olly (the Kenard of Westeros), and indirectly from Sam, is the big whammy. And then Jon rushes to hold her in the middle of a battle. The longer that happens, the bigger his target becomes, but, again, he\u2019s untouchable.So what did it all mean? The episode isn\u2019t really about taking sides, and as a viewer I\u2019m just rooting for the most interesting drama. So the first act does a decent job explaining the wildlings\u2019 motives and the crows\u2019 commitment. As Ygritte says, the free folk were first displaced and then hunted down by the king\u2019s men, and on their northern side is an army of white walkers and wights. She doesn\u2019t explain why they pillage all the southern towns, but I\u2019m not sure they have a specific agenda beyond fighting back, anyway. Meanwhile the crows valiantly defend the Wall for another night, which is the kind of qualified victory Sam recognizes as great. They fulfill their duties, live up to their vows, live up to themselves. Even though Sam could have hid with his love, he stayed with his brothers and helped. There\u2019s a lot of talk about What Men Do\u2014and a lot of examples, too\u2014but the main thing is that old Stark ideal, honor.But look at what happens. Bravery gets some men killed, some captured, some rewarded with another day of battle. The Thenns are just as brave and dutiful\u2014just as much Men\u2014but they\u2019re treated so much more despicably than the crows. Granted, they eat people, which is not what men do, but the other wildlings are just as neglected by the episode\u2019s \u201ceyes on the ground\u201d approach. What does all that honor talk amount to? And in a physical sense, the fact remains the wildlings still vastly outnumber the crows, who suffer quite a few losses themselves. The battle feels close to meaningless on the macro level.That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to let that non-ending suffice. Last week ends with the first name in the credits getting sentenced to death, and this week spends the entire hour at the Wall\u2014and all so a few names can be dropped from the credits? This season has trended toward longer periods in the same region and fewer characters overall. It\u2019s not making the show tighter, though. It\u2019s making it clunkier. As an episode, \u201cThe Watchers On The Wall\u201d is the kind of thing that needed to happen years ago. The episode has done more to make that place and those characters come alive than anything yet. And it\u2019s nice to see an on-screen battle for a change on this show that\u2019s been in a state of war for three years. But in the Episode Nine slot, it\u2019s here just to deliver spectacle, and that spectacle doesn\u2019t seem to matter nearly as much as things we put on hold. \u201cThe Watchers On The Wall\u201d makes a strong episode in itself until the ending. It\u2019s the show that doesn\u2019t really support it.", "episode_23": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.Episodes like\u00a0\u201cThe Laws Of Gods And Men\u201d make me realize that there are increasingly two Game Of Thrones\u00a0airing every Sunday night. There\u2019s the first 30 minutes of the show, which collects short vignettes from throughout Westeros and parts beyond, followed by a half-hour of meatier, more concentrated storytelling from King\u2019s Landing. By crafting episodes along this divide, the show runs the risk of bisecting itself, of doing more to isolate its teeming droves of character than geography ever could. But Game Of Thrones is smarter than that, and as\u00a0\u201cThe Laws Of Gods And Men\u201d demonstrates, David Benioff, D.B. Weiss, and crew are working hard to find the threads that connect the many disparate elements of their show.It\u2019s a very savvy, very modern way of structuring a television show. It plays to the binge-viewers as well as the week-by-week audience: The threads that play out across the season, but are only a small fraction of any given hour of Game Of Thrones, flow together more coherently in a binge. For us residents of the Stone Age who still enjoy gathering around the TV set at a predetermined date and time, we get the compelling, self-contained drama of storylines like The Purple Wedding or the trial of Tyrion Lannister. Nether\u2019s the better\u00a0\u201cshow,\u201d per se\u2014they combine to make a satisfying whole. Speaking personally, I might prefer the show-within-the-show that\u2019s taking place in King\u2019s Landing, but only because it sends larger, more palpable shockwaves to be felt across the Seven Kingdoms.Even so,\u00a0\u201cThe Laws Of Gods And Men\u201d is a neat reminder that neither half of the episode has to be one show or the other. The lengthy trial sequences demonstrate the advantages of both approaches, drawing upon details that occurred weeks, sometimes years ago in the production timeline of Game Of Thrones. The episode puts the viewer in the unique position of being the ultimate, all-seeing witness in Tyrion\u2019s trial. We may have recently accepted Littlefinger\u2019s confession to the crime of killing Joffrey, but we can corroborate nearly all of the evidence leveled against the man formally accused of the crime. All that testimony reiterates events that occurred in previous episodes, but that reiteration grants them new meaning, giving idle threats against Ser Meryn the same amount of weight as the confiscation of Grand Maester Pycelle\u2019s stores in season two. To have all of this information at our disposal puts a new spin on the show\u2019s sense of justice; to know the know difference between a truth and a lie makes the unreliable narrator act of Shae\u2019s testimony all the more heartbreaking.\u00a0To me, two questions lie at the heart of\u00a0\u201cThe Laws Of Gods And Men\u201d:\u00a0Who truly deserves justice?, andWhat\u2019s in a name?Let\u2019s return to the first question in a bit, since it\u2019s the heavier one and the one that feels likelier to linger over the final four episodes of season four. Names and titles, however, are stitched tightly to Bryan Cogman\u2019s \u201cLaws Of Gods And Men\u201d script, with Stannis, Daenerys, and Tommen each identified by the honorific they claim as their own\u2014with Dany\u2019s growing to a garish length befitting her chambers in the pyramid. Tywin and Jaime, meanwhile, do some negotiating around their shared surname, circling the importance of ensuring the continuation of their line\u2014before Tywin tips his hand to reveal that he already has the whole thing mapped out. The name you were given at birth holds tremendous sway in Westeros, but it\u2019s just as mutable as any aspect of your personality: Just ask poor Reek, who\u2019ll soon be performing the task/new form of psychological torture of\u00a0\u201cpretending\u201d to be Theon Greyjoy. Such minor distinctions feel like they\u2019re everything this week: The difference between Theon and Reek is enough to declare the former dead; what Tyrion would call Shae in their shared chambers and how she\u2019s described in the Great Hall is a betrayal greater than the one Tyrion stands accused of.Accordingly, whatever execution Tyrion faces if found guilty pales in comparison to the humiliation he faces during Shae\u2019s testimony. It goes so much deeper than any in attendance (save for Varys, who\u2019s back in a big way this week\u2014as well he should be in an episode ) could possibly guess, and when Tyrion finally lashes out in the bit of scenery chewing that\u2019s surely leading Peter Dinklage\u2019s Emmy reel this year, it\u2019s about so much more than having his lion-patterned dirty laundry aired in public. (That rant is a change of pace from the rest of \u201cThe Laws Of Gods And Men\u201d as well as a shift from the alternately sulking/sarcastic Dinklage we\u2019ve seen since the wedding feast. At the end of that thread, it\u2019s all the more surprising.) Let\u2019s not forget that Tyrion turned his back on Shae first\u2014it may have been under the guise of trying to protect the woman he loves, but he\u2019s getting his just deserts in the trial\u2019s most tragic moments. The sequence is the ultimate demonstration that Tyrion has been set up, and so he seizes the moment and rewrites that setup. In the words that Dinklage so expertly gnaws into dust, this isn\u2019t something Tywin hastily threw together following the death of his grandson\u2014this is a plot that\u2019s been unfolding for Tyrion\u2019s entire life. Injustice is all he\u2019s ever known, and his only recourse is to demand the most brutal form of justice available to him: trial by combat. The greatest revenge Tyrion Lannister could ever orchestrate is to finally and decisively upend one of his father\u2019s master plots.It might not be the justice that Tyrion deserves, but it\u2019ll be the justice he earns. And that brings us back to the big question of\u00a0\u201cThe Laws Of Gods And Men,\u201d the one raised in the title of the episode and the one that\u2019s repeated in the scenery during three of the episode\u2019s major stories. The stills HBO released for\u00a0\u201cThe Laws Of Gods And Men\u201d tell it as good as any image that\u2019s in motion: This episode is one tableau of tribunal after another, beginning in the headquarters of the Iron Bank, moving next to Dany\u2019s new digs in Meereen, and finally ending in the Great Hall. It\u2019s character upon character upon character sitting in judgment of another, granted by the authority of gods, men, numerals, and dragons to determine the fair from the unfair. Like the show\u2019s serialized storylines, the motif comes together in shaper relief when you can view these shots in short succession.\u00a0So many characters, often grouped in threes, staring across tables or down stairs at other characters seeking wrongs to be righted.\n\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=\"\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=\"\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=\"\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\n\n\nAs often happens in the real world, multiple factors and biases cloud these judge\u2019s rulings. Facts and the truth are taken into account, but as Daenerys learns tonight, making mass declarations of right and wrong can come back to bite you\u2014or lead to a line of 212 supplicants waiting for an audience with their queen. (And in a single, weary exchange with Missandei, Dany shows she is one with Selina Meyer.) It\u2019s a lesson in politicking she won\u2019t soon to forget, particularly if it begins to erode her mission statement for seizing the seat that Tywin Lannister keeps warm this week.But Dany\u2019s methods are as effective as any other presented in either half of \u201cThe Laws Of Gods And Men.\u201d This is an episode where bureaucracy is no mightier than the sword. Tyrion rests his fate with the latter, but such action gets Yara nowhere. The advantage of the sword is that it offers a most decisive verdict\u2014one that couldn\u2019t have fit satisfyingly into\u00a0\u201cThe Laws Of Gods And Men\u201d no matter how the episode was sequenced. For that, the court will need to adjourned for another week.", "episode_20": "\nThis Game Of Thrones post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.Representing the aftershocks of an eventful fourth season, \u201cThe Wars To Come\u201d is a dispatch from a show in \u201crecharge and anticipate\u201d mode. It\u2019s there in the title, taken from an exchange between Varys and Tyrion: \u201cI believe men of talent have a part to play in the war to come.\u201d The dialogue this week is freighted with portent and import, words spoken in prelude to the exploits and adventures of a reduced-capacity cast. (Hell, the whole thing kicks off with a flashback that\u2019s all about the future!) Some reductions have been made by the narrative, others by the choices of the producers: Hodor does not Hodor in the season premiere, and he will he will not Hodor at all in season five. The show\u2019s biggest villains\u2014Joffrey, Tywin\u2014have fallen, and now we wait to see if the power vacuum they\u2019ve created will be filled by previously unseen monsters or by conquering heroes.We know of one person who won\u2019t be filling it. Thanks to \u201cThe Wars To Come,\u201d there\u2019s one more menace among Game Of Thrones\u2019 dead: Mance Rayder, the king beyond the wall, is no more. This is a season premiere bookended by mortality, beginning with a wake for Tywin Lannister and ending with Mance taking an arrow to his chest. It can\u2019t be coincidence that each was killed by the same type of weapon, their superficial differences wiped away by the experience that unites all men. Tywin and Mance wielded immense power and commanded vast armies, and now both must be referred to in the past tense. As is so often the case on Game Of Thrones, their deaths are symbolic of a Westeros that is beginning to disappear\u2014not that Mance deigned to recognize its existence in the first place.And so the season premiere sets about to ask a quintessential Game Of Thrones question: When a new leader rises, what type of leader will that person be? Varys gives season five a thesis statement in the second of his scenes with Tyrion. Following a wide shot that makes the pair look very small amid the sumptuous paradise of their new home across the Narrow Sea, Varys wishes for \u201cpeace, prosperity,\u201d and \u201ca land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.\u201d His flowery words make a nice match for the idyllic surroundings.\u201cThe Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lords and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.\u201dThe back-and-forth that follows demands more time spent with the comedy duo of Conleth Hill and Peter Dinklage. It also lands on one worthy candidate who fits all of Varys\u2019 prerequisites: Daenerys Targaryen. But Emilia Clarke\u2019s character isn\u2019t the only one who fits that description. Jon Snow is hitting all of those intimidate/inspire notes at Castle Black, and his actions at the conclusion of \u201cThe Wars To Come\u201d demonstrate his deep reserves of mercy. He still has two sisters out there, and the one who appears this week just removed her last major obstacle to controlling The Eyrie, leaving Robin to fend for himself at some sort of finishing school for young megalomaniacs. And then there\u2019s Margaery Tyrell, who smirks and slinks her way around the premiere, torturing her mother-in-law from afar and interrupting a brother who\u2019s being rather brazen about his sexual exploits. In the latter scene, breakin\u2019-all-the-rules Loras argues that his sister\u2019s scheming will lead only to an eternity with Cersei Lannister, but Margaery has other ideas. When Natalie Dormer responds with a most ominous \u201cperhaps,\u201d she makes Rhaegal and Viserion look like geckos. The dialogue of \u201cThe Wars To Come\u201d weighs a ton, even when the sentences are one-word long. The episode plays a lot of tricks of scale like that. Tyrion sees the world, but only through a hole in a crate. Daenerys\u2019 followers yank the winged idol from the top of the pyramid, yet their queen is a speck on the screen next to pets she used to hold in her hand. Her fellow self-proclaimed monarch, Mance Rayder, is reduced in size by composition and wardrobe, appearing so small and so defeated when Jon visits him in his cell. Brienne, a knight with no lord to serve, nonetheless threatens to buckle the upper reaches of the frame when filmed from below. In an atmosphere of uncertainty, when a boy sits on the Iron Throne, the established hierarchies of Game Of Thrones are thrown into confusion, and \u201cThe Wars To Come\u201d represents this confusion visually.If the words of David Benioff and D.B. Weiss\u2019 script resound with rhetoric, it\u2019s because \u201cThe Wars To Come\u201d is a series of stump speeches. In terms of real-world events, the season five premiere has excellent timing. With a presidential election on the horizon, the voting public is meeting (or re-meeting in many cases) the candidates who deem themselves worthy of sitting in America\u2019s own Red Keep. It\u2019s campaign season in Westeros, too, where the incumbents are throwing lavish parties and their longtime opponents are pulling out the pyrotechnics. Over in Meereen, Daario presses Dany on the importance of compromise. The people with money and influence are deciding which contender they\u2019d like to throw their weight behind. Mavericks fire long shots. Insiders plot sabotage. \u201cThe Wars To Come\u201d\u2019s resolution depends on the decisions of a warrior, but its climax is initiated by the machinations of an advisor: Jon holds the bow, and Stannis gives the address, but Melisandre starts the fire.There are compelling stories to be told within that context, but they\u2019re not \u201cThe Wars To Come\u201d\u2019s to tell. The season premiere must serve as prologue, and it serves honorably\u2014and given its occasional lack of stimulation, \u201cserves\u201d is an apt verb here. With lots of talk and little action, the episode will likely catch some flak for stalling. (Did you sense a disturbance when Sansa and Baelish\u2019s carriage passed by Brienne and Pod right after they were talking about finding Sansa? As if millions of voices suddenly cried out, \u201cShe\u2019s right there!\u201d) The night ahead of Game Of Thrones is dark and full of empty pages, so Benioff and Weiss need to be sparing with what source material they have left, right? But that\u2019s another important aspect of that final scene. If stalling were truly at play, wouldn\u2019t Mance\u2019s execution be delayed for a few more episodes? His death is more than a signpost of change or a show of Jon\u2019s leadership style\u2014it\u2019s also an indication that Game Of Thrones isn\u2019t afraid to move forward with what it\u2019s been given. As Benioff and Weiss prepare to take their show over the Wall and beyond the bounds of A Song Of Ice And Fire, it\u2019s not as if they\u2019ve run out of tragic shocks and epic heroism. Sometimes you just have to wait for them to get there.And if you refuse to be that flexible? Sticking by your convictions can earn you a beautiful throne room in the type of massive stronghold Dany now occupies. But it can also get your foot soldiers killed, or yourself burned at the stake. While it contemplates the kind of leadership it will next put onscreen, the leadership behind the scenes at Game Of Thrones looks refreshingly willing to roll with the punches.", "episode_21": "\nThis Thursday through Monday: The Long Weekend Of\u00a0Thrones.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.As we begin to look back at Game Of Thrones\u2019 fourth season, it becomes plain that the money quote was there from the first trailer on: \u201cThey have a choice: They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.\u201d Season four hinged on the tectonic shifts Daenerys Targaryen alludes to in that line of dialogue: The deaths of rulers and their closest allies, the ascendance of Westeros\u2019 new heirs. In the season finale, both of the Clegane brothers lay prone and dying, the show\u2019s most physically imposing forces cut down in battle. But what they represented hardly matters anymore: In this new world, which bears a striking resemblance to the oldest of worlds, there be giants, mammoths, giants riding mammoths, and Ray Harryhausen skeletons. What a difference nine episodes makes.On one hand, that\u2019s a thrilling promise for a season finale to make. \u201cIf it looked like we\u2019d blown up everything you thought you know about Westeros before, wait until you meet this ancient pyrokinetic elf,\u201d D.B. Weiss and David Benioff seem to say with \u201cThe Children.\u201d So many characters have died, so many allegiances and consolidations of power have been torn asunder that this might as well be a universe in which one prominent quest\u2014the one with the heaviest doses of mysticism and fantasy magic\u2014concludes in a Carcosan tangle of roots and a promise that Bran Stark will \u201cfind\u201d what he has \u201clost.\u201d You\u2019ll have to wait until next spring to find out what the Warg behind the three-eyed raven is getting at; the stubborn refusal to provide many of the finale\u2019s most basic conclusions is the most frustrating part of\u00a0\u201cThe Children.\u201d If you\u2019re in this for concrete answers, then you\u2019re basically in the same position as The Hound, stuck begging for deliverance while Arya plucks a bag of silver from your belt. It\u2019s cruel, but hey: The show needs to be frugal with every last shred of source material at this point in its run.I have to wonder if the unmoored feeling some Game Of Thrones\u00a0viewers had this year\u00a0has anything to do with the season\u2019s ever-fluid status quo.\u00a0I wouldn\u2019t describe this as a misstep\u2014I\u2019ve been taken with the way Game Of Thrones brashly\u00a0dismantled itself across the past 10 episodes\u2014but a TV show that never gives you anything to grasp on to for more than two or three episodes at a time can be an alienating viewing experience. The game of thrones\u00a0could often be a game of withholding in season four, so it\u2019s a bit jarring when characters suddenly start taking or receiving exactly what they want in \u201cThe Children.\u201d Cersei strolls into her brother\u2019s chambers and embraces him without fear, making the sept sequence in\u00a0\u201cBreaker Of Chains\u201d look all the more mishandled. Arya sets sail for Braavos, looking for all the world that she\u2019s going to pull a\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the king of the world\u201d\u2014not that that portending positive things for Leonardo DiCaprio. Tyrion not only escapes King\u2019s Landing with his life, but also takes his father down in the process. Not that we have confirmation that Tywin is dead or\u00a0that Tyrion is truly secure in that crate next to Varys, but such is the partially dissatisfying nature of a cliffhanger, a storytelling device that gets off on being withholding.\u201cThe Children\u201d is more an ellipsis than a period (or an exclamation mark, even with all of its swashbuckling excitement), but in that it closely mirrors the final chapters of a single volume in a multi-part book series. The doors need to be left cracked open for season five, which is also how the pileup of storylines makes its way into the finale\u2014even at 66 minutes, it\u2019s crazy to reconstruct this episode in your head and realize\u00a0\u201cOh yeah: This whole thing starts with Jon Snow\u2026\u201d Todd VanDerWerff has a For Our Consideration essay on deck that tackles Game Of Thrones\u00a0shifting sense of storytelling, so I won\u2019t horn in on that territory, but the latter episodes of this season\u2014and\u00a0\u201cThe Children\u201d especially\u2014give themselves a tremendous amount of content to balance in the space of an hour. Considering this, it\u2019s curious that HBO hasn\u2019t given Weiss and Benioff the timeslot freedom FX seemingly affords all of its originals now, binge-watching-friendly running lengths ballooning and contracting as the story dictates. It\u2019s a carryover of momentum from\u00a0\u201cThe Watchers On The Wall,\u201d but\u00a0\u201cThe Children\u201d gives its action sequences more breathing room than its dialogue-driven ones\u2014though with all the negotiating that happens this week, maybe that\u2019s a good thing. In this instance, director Alex Graves handles negotiations between swords and fists with greater panache, continuing the trend of dashing adventure filmmaking embedded within season four. The confrontation between Brienne and The Hound is as breathtaking as it is devastating.But from my\u00a0ludicrous, digging-too-deep vantage point, the most rewarding aspects of\u00a0\u201cThe Children\u201d are thematic. In the grand television scheme, Game Of Thrones\u00a0is a highly entertaining second-tier prestige series, of the type that readily populates this current era of Orphan Blacks and Justifieds. It\u2019s a blockbuster, not a game changer, but all through season four the series still did fantastic work between the lines. Season four is a season of preparation, preservation, and protection, and the finale honors that as heralds of a new world shove aside the old guard and swords rattle over the privilege to make that new world a reality. The First Men referred to Bran\u2019s savior and its kind as The Children, but you could also apply that label to any of the characters left standing and poised to headline season five. It\u2019s too bad one of those will be Jon Snow, since season four felt like it forgot what to do with Kit Harington and his character; the loss of Ygritte cuts deepest as the loss of Jon\u2019s most compelling relationship.But Daenerys and Arya and Brienne and Cersei survive\u00a0\u201cThe Children\u201d and season four, an intriguing statement on feminine power within Game Of Thrones\u00a0that\u2019s only slightly undercut by Tyrion strangling Shae to death. (The more I think about it, the more Tyrion\u2019s mini revenge flick becomes the part of\u00a0\u201cThe Children\u201d that sits least comfortably with me. It\u2019s payoff, but it\u2019s tawdry payoff that\u2019s lit and shot like a much cheaper show than Game Of Thrones.) At the end of a season when certain events in certain septs contributed to the Seven Kingdoms\u2019\u00a0He-Man Woman Haters\u2019 Club vibe, it\u2019s heartening to see that much of Dany\u2019s new world is made in her image. She must make compromises that wind up making her look like a leader in the old world, but the scenes in Meereen tonight show just how far the character has come and how she\u2019s grown into her responsibilities and duties. The Dany of seasons two or three would not be so flexible, would be too blinded by her vision and her desires to even consider putting the dragons in chains. There\u2019s an acceptance there\u2014and a strength, mirrored by the way Brienne beats the snot out of The Hound\u2014lacking in other pretenders to the Iron Throne. (The difficulty of the situation is written all over Emilia Clarke\u2019s face, an impressive emotional display toward creatures that are just 1s and 0s in some faraway computer.) The decision to not do the thing that would bring her the most satisfaction is in Arya\u2019s refusal to grant Sandor Clegane\u2019s final wish, too\u2014because there are other people to consider. Westeros is a world without mercy, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a place without compassion.But it is, for the time being, a place without conclusion. There\u2019s a sense of optimistic possibility that permeates the end of\u00a0\u201cThe Children,\u201d one that doesn\u2019t square with the ravages of season four but still manages to send the show into hiatus on an appropriate note. So much of these episodes revolved around clearing the show\u2019s slate, an act referenced, intentionally or not, by the waterfall that transitions out of Tyrion\u2019s escape and into Arya\u2019s passage to Braavos. Escape and imprisonment factor heavily into\u00a0\u201cThe Children\u201d as well, particularly in terms of how the survivors are increasingly unbound by custom, belief, and tradition. It\u2019s here that the upbeat ending is the most earned, because there are literal and figurative freedoms to be enjoyed by these characters. In their meeting on the rocky cliffs outside the Bloody Gate, Brienne of Tarth and Arya Stark recognize one another as kindred spirits. In an attempt to win Arya\u2019s trust and to help fulfill her vow to the girl\u2019s mother, Brienne compares her own bucking of conventions with those of Arya. But ultimately Arya forges her own path into the future, because the path into the new world of Game Of Thrones\u00a0is one you have to blaze independently. In the old world, they like to amass power and influence over large groups of people\u2014but that kind of practice leaves you vulnerable to being plugged with a crossbow while you\u2019re sitting on the toilet. \u201cThe Children\u201d also reminds us that there is no safety in Westeros, and thus no safety in numbers. That could be true of the new world as well as the old one, but we\u2019ll have to wait 10 months or so to know for sure. \u00a0", "episode_26": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.\u201cWe don\u2019t hurt little girls in Dorne.\u201d\u2014Oberyn Martell\u201cEverywhere in the world they hurt little girls.\u201d\u2014Cersei LannisterIt\u2019s intriguing that\u00a0\u201cFirst Of His Name\u201d should arrive at the halfway point of Game Of Thrones\u2019\u00a0fourth season, the year in which the show has received the loudest criticisms of its depictions of sexual violence. The episode is by no means a corrective for what occurred between Cersei and Jaime during\u00a0\u201cBreaker Of Chains.\u201d It is, however, indication that showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (credited once more for the script) recognize their show\u2019s degree of cruelty and how it\u2019s disproportionately directed at its female characters. When Cersei and Oberyn engage in the exchange above, it\u2019s not only an acknowledgement of what her brother has done to her, but also an acknowledgement that such trauma is a frighteningly common occurrence in this world. People like Oberyn are attempting to turn that tide, but change\u2014as it is in our world\u2014is a slow and frustrating process.Game Of Thrones\u00a0works with a particular set of challenges, primary of which is reconciling the realities and worldviews of Westeros with those of the real world. This is a show set in a medieval time period, one that tells stories of a civilization that\u2019s still trying to give feudalism a go. It\u2019s a nasty system, and for every jewel-encrusted scene of courtly escapism, there are\u00a0three or four illustrations of the human costs. As seen in\u00a0\u201cBreaker Of Chains,\u201d the show can sell out the emotional heft of that cost for plot-based concerns, but it\u2019s still smart enough to stage a scene like tonight\u2019s dialogue about the Lannisters\u2019 financial status. Nothing is secure in this world, not even the mining reserves that have given the lion his golden hide for generations. To witness the failure of the system that keeps such houses in power is satisfying to our modern sensibilities\u2014almost as much as the cathartic destruction of Caster\u2019s Keep.The fiery frames that conclude\u00a0\u201cFirst Of His Name\u201d are of vital contrast with the emerging themes of season four. Now, more than ever, it\u2019s become important for these characters to fortify themselves. If any criticisms linger about the lack of momentum in these episodes (including those that were registered in this space last week), it is because the majority of their movement is in retreat. The most powerful person in all of Westeros wasn\u2019t safe at his own wedding feast, and so everyone seems to be throwing up defenses. So much is tied up in the establishment of these garrisons surrounding the primary players: Littlefinger and Sansa pass by dozens of guards even before they can make their way through the Bloody Gate; Daenerys, a character defined by liberation and characterized by the unhindered travel of her dragons, issues her decision to rule from incredibly cramped chambers. As things currently stand, the greatest offense is a good defense, summed up pithily by Petyr Baelish himself:\u00a0\u201cKnow your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000.\u201dIt\u2019s a good match for an episode as laden with symbolism as this one is\u2014in the words of the characters as well as their actions. When Jon Snow at last plunges his sword through Karl, it\u2019s a callback to the deed Pod describes to Brienne by their campfire\u2014a bit of heroism necessitated and\u00a0accomplished because parties involved let their guard down. The Lannisters seek to insulate themselves from ruin and insurrection through marriage and fealty, shields that could be as effective as Meryn Trant\u2019s armor, yet still fall victim to the grand plots and long cons of a patient schemer like Littlefinger. And as if last week\u2019s visit from the White Walkers wasn\u2019t enough to reinforce the fact that monsters still walk among our heroes, li\u2019l Robin Arryn is back to remind us that no one is invulnerable to being wished out the moon door.Which is why I think it\u2019s so important that\u00a0\u201cFirst Of His Name,\u201d the pronoun in the title aside, puts so much focus on the show\u2019s female protagonists and antagonists.\u00a0\u201cI will do what queens do,\u201d Dany tells Ser Jorah before Emilia Clarke strikes an appropriately regal pose on the balcony.\u00a0\u201cI will rule.\u201d But how she rules marks an important distinction, and a powerful rejoinder to some of the he-man women-hating Game Of Thrones\u00a0has done in season five: It\u2019s from a maternal sense of preservation and shelter. She feels a responsibility to the freed men and women whose cities she\u2019s moved on from (her neglect of these territories containing shades of U.S. foreign policy from 2001 to the present), and it\u2019s from a place of compassion that she seeks to act upon that responsibility. Notice that Dany has traded her riding gear for a more Olympian look this week. She means to offer protection from on high\u2014not that that does anything to mitigate the growing god complex she\u2019s acquired in the past two seasons.It\u2019s a sort of herding impulse that\u2019s taken to the extreme by Lysa Arryn\u2019s child-rearing tactics: Keep those you love close by, and threaten to crush the hands of anyone who might wish to take them from you. Cersei hasn\u2019t had the luxury of exercising such tactics: She\u2019s seen the Iron Throne claim a husband and a son, and her only daughter is in the care of a house that seeks revenge against the Lannisters. (All claims of civilized, humane behavior from the Martells to the contrary.) For all this, however, there\u2019s still a sense within \u201cFirst Of His Name\u201d that Cersei and Margaery control their own fates in King\u2019s Landing. There\u2019s such power in the way their conversation at Tommen\u2019s coronation is presented: Elevated above the masses (like Dany in her Meereen stronghold), eyes locked straight ahead until a potentially wounding jab can be struck. They\u2019re cooler customers than Lysa, who appears to spell her own doom when she gives Sansa that rundown of her life at the Eyrie. \u201cFirst Of His Name\u201d deftly raises the personal stakes for these characters while demonstrating that any blow they may wish to strike at this time might bring about even more problems.It\u2019s an emphasis on parrying over thrusting that\u2019s underlined in the expertly choreographed sequence of Arya\u2019s sword-fighting practice. As Syrio Forel taught her so long ago, the Water Dance is a nuanced and elegant form of combat, so different from the hacking and slashing we see the Night\u2019s Watch engage in at Craster\u2019s Keep. The Hound may outmatch her in size and armor, but she manages to land Needle\u2019s point on his abdomen nonetheless. Game Of Thrones\u00a0would seem to favor the blunt, forceful, barbaric method of getting what you want, but\u00a0\u201cFirst Of His Name\u201d reminds us that that\u2019s not the only way. After all, if Littlefinger is to be believed, the most effective way to orchestrate the fall of a house or a king isn\u2019t a full-scale war\u2014it\u2019s through secrets, lies, and poisons. Anyone who seizes power by more forceful means could very well find themselves alienated: Consider the horror that Bran instills in Hodor after the former takes control of the latter in the struggle with Locke. What needs to be done is done, but a trust is violated that might never be restored. Things are often taken by force in Westeros, but the blood on Hodor\u2019s hands indicates that the show does not endorse or condone such methods. And when it depicts these methods, the show can still get them right from time to time.\u00a0", "episode_27": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.\u201cOathkeeper\u201d isn\u2019t a particularly entertaining hour of television. It\u2019s a bridge to forthcoming passages in Game Of Thrones\u2019 fourth season, composed of storylines that are either well under way (Daenerys\u2019 anti-slavery crusade, Tyrion\u2019s imprisonment) or just getting started (Jon\u2019s assault on Craster\u2019s Keep, Brienne\u2019s renewed quest to find the Stark girls). Well before the White Walkers throw to the credits with the episode\u2019s big gasp of a conclusion, this is an episode of cliffhangers. Its main storytelling aim is the enticement to check back next week, one of the less appealing attributes serialized TV inherited from its literary forebears.Unfortunately, this bridge happens to also be one of the shoddiest looking installments of Game Of Thrones\u00a0to date. Even in its dullest passages, the show can usually be counted upon for visual wow factor\u2014and\u00a0\u201cOathkeeper\u201d delivers on that count for the first 15 minutes or so. Stunning landscapes serve as the backdrop for Dany\u2019s latest victory and Jaime\u2019s latest sword-fighting lesson, but elsewhere, Emmy-nominated director Michelle MacLaren gets a bum assignment. She\u2019s contending with the less dazzling of the show\u2019s CGI subjects, and\u00a0it\u2019s only partially the White Walkers\u2019 fault: Though\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0continues to struggle when it comes to depicting the mythological menace of its most mythologically menacing foes, the triumphant sight of Targaryen colors flying over Meereen is undercut by cheap-looking effects. Considering the ways the episode finds to obscure the White Walkers\u2014including a POV shot that\u2019s at least a clever nod to\u00a0MacLaren\u2019s old gig, Breaking Bad\u2014I have to wonder if budget was being conserved this week with an eye toward later episodes.The episode\u2019s resources are more wisely spent between the lines. Payoff for threads old and new is sure to be found down the road, but within\u00a0\u201cOathkeeper\u201d specifically, there are thematic riches to be found. This is an episode preoccupied with searches for justice, fitting for a season that\u2019s being defined by Joffrey\u2019s murder,\u00a0an event that\u2019s like a prism of what\u2019s seen as just and unjust in Westeros, refracting divergent opinions and new plotlines for all who witnessed it. It hardly matters how and why the conspiracy to kill the king\u2014in which Littlefinger and Olenna have both implicated themselves\u2014was pulled off. What\u2019s of greater importance going forward are developments like Cersei and Tyrion both wanting the same thing\u2014that thing being justice\u2014but from different angles.The mother of madness and the mother of dragons have a lot in common on this count: In preparing her punishment for prisoners captured in the siege of Meereen, Daenerys declares\u00a0\u201cI will answer injustice with justice.\u201d Cersei must be pushing similar thoughts through clouds of grief and red wine, resolute in her stance that someone must pay for the loss of her son\u2014doesn\u2019t matter who, doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s actually the killer. Each is absolutely cutthroat in this wish, and it\u2019s fascinating to see how \u201cOathkeeper\u201d demonstrates that a thirst for vengeance affects those who are ascending to power as well as those who are drunkenly stumbling down the stairs toward the end of their courtly life. From low-born to high-born this week, so many characters want to see a sense of equilibrium restored. Fat chance of that happening any time soon. \u00a0As Lord Commander of the Kings Guard, it\u2019s Jaime\u2019s duty to uphold what\u2019s right and lawful\u2014but there\u2019s that little matter of the impropriety he committed last week. What happened between Jaime and his sister in the sept isn\u2019t directly addressed, but the frosty interactions between the pair indicate the additional pain Cersei now bears. Of course, it could just be the mourning getting in the way, but the one scene of \u201cOathkeeper\u201d that could\u2019ve addressed That One Scene From Last Week plays things close to the vest. Placing Jaime at a crossroads and piling more sorrow on Cersei\u2019s already sorrowful state, it\u2019s looking like the assault in the sept has been cast deep into troublesome \u201crape as plotpoint\u201d territory. That could prove trivializing, but given the slow manner in which \u201cOathkeeper\u201d moves, it could be a while until any consequences are felt.This complicates the aid Jaime gives to Brienne and Tyrion this week, making the misdeed less a mistake made by someone discovering his inner virtue, and more a tossed-off attempt at plotting a counterpoint to his recent string of good deeds. It\u2019s just such a distracting about face, particularly in Jaime\u2019s scenes with the woman who bears a chivalric torch for him. If Cersei and Daenerys are two sides of the same coin in \u201cOathkeeper,\u201d then so are Brienne and Jon Snow. Separated by circumstance from those they care for, each character recommits themselves to a warrior\u2019s cause this week. Game Of Thrones\u00a0is a show that excels at depicting drama on scales personal and\u00a0epic, but we\u2019re only just starting to see characters make these kinds of moves in season four. I wouldn\u2019t count Dany out here, because she\u2019s been so tied up in laying waste and recruiting followers that the writers sacrificed her sense of self long ago; there\u2019s a greater reinvigoration to Brienne and Jon rallying behind things bigger than themselves within\u00a0\u201cOathkeeper.\u201d Jon\u2019s in for quite the surprise once he reaches Caster\u2019s Keep\u2014though Locke volunteering to accompany Jon\u2019s party (and the ominous orchestral sting it prompts from the score) suggests there might be a surprise before\u00a0they reach that destination.That\u2019s appropriate, because\u00a0\u201cOathkeeper\u201d is also a Game Of Thrones\u00a0installment concerned with taking risks, of potentially exposing yourself to harm in order to get what you want. Or, as Olenna puts it after she all but confesses to executing Joffrey\u2019s poisoning, to \u201cYou just do what needs to be done.\u201d This might not be the most visually astute episode of Game Of Thrones, but it does choose its words wisely.\u00a0\u201cOathkeeper\u201d begins with Grey Worm struggling to master the common tongue, but in his speech to the slaves of Meereen, he knows exactly what to say. \u201cNo one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it.\u201d It\u2019s an important step for this particular storyline (downplaying the notion that it\u2019s Dany who\u2019s doing all this work, and not the thousands marching behind her), but it ties in nicely with the rest of\u00a0\u201cOathkeeper\u201d as well. We can\u2019t expect anyone to find justice for us; we can\u2019t expect others to keep promises we made, either. Sometimes you have to remind yourself of that oath, reclaim ownership of it, and ride off into the sunset in pursuit of its fulfillment. Had\u00a0\u201cOathkeeper\u201d invested a little more in the pursuit and a little less in the ride, it just might have maintained some momentum heading into the midway point of season four.", "episode_24": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.Game Of Thrones\u00a0uses any chance it gets to bring the world of Westeros back down to size. In earlier seasons, the show could depend upon its various families and noble houses to do that trick, but season four is a time of great discord, strife, imprisonment, and death for those central groups, fractured or scrambled by public executions (take your pick) or narrative concerns. The Starks are either dead or in hiding; the Lannisters\u00a0(the important ones, at least)\u00a0were all together at King\u2019s Landing until a little poison found its way into King Joffrey\u2019s wine glass. These dependable casts-within-a-cast have been shattered, as much a symbol of an evolving Game Of Thrones\u00a0as the victims in the bloody race toward the Iron Throne.Remaining at the show\u2019s disposal, however, are the many, many character pairings that the show has established over time\u2014smaller, more precise testing grounds for ideas about loyalty, virtue, and trust among the Westerosi. These are duos that have come together by circumstance, choice, or some combination of the two, but I can\u2019t think of another\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0that used so many of them so effectively. They are, in essence, manifestations of the mockingbird Lord Baelish has adopted as his personal emblem: indications that the people in each duo are more faithful to one another than they are any ancient sigil.Fitting to this setup,\u00a0\u201cMockingbird\u201d is obsessed with binaries.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought,\u201d Jorah tells Daenerys, alluding to gray areas that don\u2019t exist this week. You either are or you aren\u2019t\u2014and if you wind up presenting wishy-washy evidence without any serious back up, you\u2019re going to wind up pulling late-night watch duties with Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly. Things could always shift or change, but at the end of this week\u2019s episode, it feels like plenty of character dynamics within this new Westeros are cemented. Dany draws the line in the sand herself:\u00a0\u201cThey can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.\u201d One sneak preview of this new world of hers: Daario Naharis gets boinked in order to make sure Yunkai stays out of the hands of the masters (all the while giving Michel Huisman enough free time to continue his guest stint on Orphan Black).In light of the game-changing turbulence\u2014dead king, wildling advances, the confirmed survival of Hot Pie\u2014in season four, \u201cMockingbird\u201d gives the viewer some important moorings in its Daenerys-Jorah and Arya-Hound scenes. Their surroundings are unfamiliar, but in the case of the first pair, their dynamic is one of the few remaining that dates all the way back to the beginning of the series. Emilia Clarke and Iain Glen show as much in their interactions this week: There\u2019s a snappy, lived-in feel to the way their characters address each other once Jorah enters the Khaleesi\u2019s chambers, like the old married couple he\u2019d so like them to be. They\u2019re written to have that kind of grudging respect for one another, at least, and there\u2019s an honest sweetness in Dany telling Jorah that it was he who changed her mind about her planned treatment of the Yunkai masters\u2014a welcome reminder that there\u2019s still some humanity within the imperious leader she\u2019s become.There\u2019s an equally well-observed, curiously theatrical feel to\u00a0\u201cMockingbird\u201d\u2019s first check-in with Arya and The Hound. They share the scene with the dying man and his burning homestead, but it may as well just be the two of them: The air\u2019s heavy with metaphor, the dying man eventually a symbol of The Hound\u2019s sense of mercy, Arya\u2019s maturation, and the bond between the two characters. The man is a font of philosophical meandering, he may as well be offering omniscient narration of Arya and The Hound\u2019s situation (and Westeros at large) for the way he\u2019s pulled out of the shot prior to receiving a knife between the ribs. There\u2019s a swords-drawn attack planting us firmly in Game Of Thrones territory\u00a0following that death, but before that, the three characters talk about mortality (\u201cNothing is just nothing\u201d)\u00a0and fairness like they\u2019re on a blank stage.In the episode\u2019s immediate wake,\u00a0\u201cMockingbird\u201d feels like a daring step outside of the box for Game Of Thrones\u2014and for that, I fear that I might be overrating the episode. But it\u2019s a valuable respite after the courtroom fireworks of\u00a0\u201cThe Laws Of Gods And Men,\u201d a reinvestment and advancement of a new core of characters. For an episode that only makes fleeting mention of all the show\u2019s fallen\u00a0protagonists and antagonists,\u00a0\u201cMockingbird\u201d makes the full impact of those deaths count. New alliances are forming all over the place because the show now follows remote bands of survivors; defensive\u00a0maneuvers\u00a0weigh on the minds of those survivors so heavily that Jon Snow\u2019s talking about sealing the tunnel into Castle Black while his sister constructs a model of their old, fortified home surrounded by the high courtyard walls of her new residence.Sansa Stark and her husband are separated by distance (and the fact that they were never particularly close in their arranged marriage), but they\u2019re united in their captive states. They each say a difficult farewell tonight, too, though the difficulty of Sansa\u2019s is mitigated by the fact that Lysa came pretty close to tossing her niece out of the Moon Door. There\u2019s a satisfying structure to the way Tyrion cycles through potential champions in\u00a0\u201cMockingbird,\u201d a little three-act play about allegiance with the knife-twisting second act of Bronn\u2019s engagement to Lollys Stokeworth. Tyrion has said farewell so many times this season, Bronn\u2019s departure being the latest example of Cersei\u2019s ongoing campaign to isolate her brother at every turn. That makes it all the more delicious that Oberyn ultimately volunteers to be Tyrion\u2019s champion, not only giving him the chance to avenge his sister by killing The Mountain, but also giving him the chance to disappoint and embarrass the Lannisters on a grand scale. The men don\u2019t say as much, but after the last few weeks that Tyrion has had, he and Oberyn share the desire to see the lion endure a public humiliation.They make a swiftly delightful team, much like that of Lady Brienne and Podrick, who stare down a baldly metaphorical fork in the road and decided to go Pod\u2019s way, for once. If I have any misgivings about\u00a0\u201cMockingbird,\u201d it\u2019s the way in which the subtext of the script sits at the center of scenes like this one one, frantically waving its arms as Brienne accepts that her squire knows more than he lets on. Gwendoline Christie appears to be the series\u2019 character-pairing MVP: Podrick is getting an overhaul similar to the one Jaime received from Brienne last year\u2014though Pod began the journey as a likeable character. Theirs is a representation of Game Of Thrones\u2019 continued ability to draw compelling relationships between its dwindling reserves of character. Three episodes away from its fourth-season finale, Game Of Thrones\u00a0is a lot like the two riders perched at the split in the road: One toward the big, loud excitement of last week\u2019s courtroom scene or one toward\u00a0\u201cMockingbird\u201d\u2019s character-driven, dialogue-centric proceedings. This week, the show took the road less traveled, and that made all the difference\u2014but I wouldn\u2019t want it to make all the difference on a weekly basis. Fortunately, whatever happens next will have a firm foundation to build off of.", "episode_25": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.The Mountain just cracked open Oberyn Martell\u2019s head like a coconut. Or, in more thematically appropriate terms, he smashed it like his hands were rocks and Oberyn\u2019s head was a beetle. It was certainly the most horrific sight you\u2019ll see on TV all week\u2014edging past the newly minted Ramsay Bolton and his\u00a0\u201cThis is my design\u201d work on the Ironborn\u2014made all the more horrific by the fact that it spelled doom for not one, but two beloved Game Of Thrones\u00a0characters.\u00a0But forget all of that for a second, because I think Sansa Stark deserves the lede on this one.Not to sound\u00a0disingenuous, mind you: Sophie Turner descending those Eyrie stairs\u2014with a badass composure that would made Angelina Jolie proclaim\u00a0\u201cKnow what, Maleficent is a passion project of mine, but maybe I\u2019ve been miscast\u201d\u2014is as much a turning point as Oberyn\u2019s grisly defeat. \u201cThe Mountain And The Viper\u201d hinges on the one property that is more unstoppable than Ser Gregor Clegane, the property that touches Ramsay\u2019s new surname, Ser Jorah\u2019s dismissal, and Tyrion Lannister\u2019s death sentence: change. Change is inevitable, change is coming, change is the horde of wildlings charging through Mole\u2019s Town this week and on to The Wall the next. We\u2019re all Arya Stark right now, laughing our asses off because of our inability to stay ahead of the rate of progress in this world.And maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s been in the thick of things while her little sister roamed greater Westeros, but Sansa gets it. After suffering for so long, she\u2019s in a position to get out ahead, and she\u2019s taking it, even if that means allying herself with an opportunistic sleaze who bears a torch for her dead mother. \u201cLord Baelish has told many lies to protect me,\u201d Sansa tells the council accusing her protector (there\u2019s that word again) in aiding Lysa\u2019s trip through the Moon Door. And now Sansa\u2019s returned the favor, savvy enough to preserve the one safe haven she\u2019s had for ages, fully aware that favors are the only currency truly respected by this former master of coin. Her transformation\u2014from the frightened child cornered in her Eyrie quarters to the baddest new puppetmaster at the Westerosi debutante\u2019s ball\u2014happens swiftly, but time is of the essence here. (Also, next week\u2019s episode looks to be to Castle Black what \u201cBlackwater\u201d was to King\u2019s Landing, and this isn\u2019t a transition that would have as much impact in a season finale.)Next week\u2019s episode will stand out because of the break from format; if season four\u2019s flair for endings is any indication, the season finale ought to leave the audience collectively without its breath. And yet I don\u2019t think either hour will end up topping \u201cThe Mountain And The Viper.\u201d Everything\u2019s top-notch Game Of Thrones here: acting (Turner\u2019s my pick for episode MVP, but Peter Dinklage does series-best work in the dungeon), direction (Alex Graves gets ambitious at the top of the episode with that long take through the tavern), and writing (so many layers of interpretation in that beetle monologue) alike. Some will look upon the episode\u2019s grand finale as shock for shock\u2019s sake, but whatever sent Tyrion Lannister to the chopping block needed to prompt a bigger gasp than Joffrey\u2019s death. I\u2019m guessing that the last minute twist will be seen by some as evidence of Game Of Thrones\u00a0increasingly toying with the viewers\u2019 emotions\u2014with Maisie Williams cackling at her character\u2019s misfortune presented as exhibit B. But there\u2019s another way to look at it: the show laying the groundwork for monumental, irreversible change.Think of all the characters who\u2019ve been lost in the last four seasons; consider the forces commanded by Mance Rayder, prepared to knock at the doors of Castle Black. Season four began with a consideration of how much the landscape in Westeros has changed since the death of Jon Arryn, and the episodes that followed have cemented that change. In\u00a0\u201cThe Mountain And The Viper,\u201d there\u2019s a reminder of how many different men have held the Iron Throne in that time, with Jorah\u2019s banishment prompted by a sealed pardon from the late King Robert. Kings and those claiming to be kings are dead, and corpses produced by their war lie putrified outside the garrison claimed for the Boltons in \u201cThe Mountain And The Viper.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting how many of these developments are predicated on ink and parchment: Jorah and Ramsay each receive news via scroll, while Theon delivers scrawled conditions of surrender Lord Bolton never intended to uphold. The catch is in that third example: Just because it\u2019s written doesn\u2019t mean those words are worth a damn. Minds change as easily as fates, and paper can be torn up, carried away, or engulfed in flame. What is dead may never die, but what is changed can always be unchanged.And as Game Of Thrones\u00a0changes into a show on which Grey Worm and Missandei can command a side story with real emotional stakes and a degree of tenderness, so it must be a show that can let go of Tyrion. \u201cThe Mountain And The Viper\u201d is a collection of centerpiece sequences, to the point that it could hold the biggest of those sequences to the final 10 minutes and avoid all accusations of building roadblocks to the fireworks factory. In an episode that doesn\u2019t end with The Mountain performing a manual Scanners\u00a0routine, Tyrion\u2019s tale of rocks, bugs, and the unwitting forces that bring them together would be the biggest moment\u2014not that anything else in \u201cThe Mountain And The Viper\u201d steals its resonance.\u00a0If anything, the trial by combat underlines the monologue\u2019s importance: This is Tyrion speaking of his own existence, as an insect that fate knows only to smash. The metaphorical hand bears the name Lannister for obvious reasons, but this is more than a parable about Tyrion and Tywin. It\u2019s about all of these characters, so many of them seemingly introduced for the sole purpose of suffering. The hand goes by many names (Ramsay Bolton, Joffrey, the maesters), its beetles spread across the Seven Kingdoms and beyond. In the end, Tyrion\u2019s only crime may have been that he was more invested in decoding these cruelties and less invested in putting a stop to them.\u00a0\u201cCertainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron,\u201d he tells Jaime, slyly nodding toward whichever lunkheaded gods make the people of Westeros fear the giant rock.The push forward is important, especially on a show like Game Of Thrones, on which we tend to learn so much more about the characters in reveals of backstory like Tyrion\u00a0and Jaime\u2019s dungeon dialogue. Though Oberyn undoubtedly pushes for progress, he\u2019s undone by dwelling in the past, and his zeal for an Inigo Montoya moment exposes a vulnerability The Mountain is too happy to exploit. He\u2019s ground into dust by the old world; those advancing toward the new world are marked by some curious framing choices on the part of Alex Graves and cinematographer\u00a0Anette Haellmigk. Eschewing standard close-up conventions, Daenerys,\u00a0Grey Worm, and\u00a0Sansa, are at separate times photographed as if they\u2019re preparing to burst out of frame:\n\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=\"\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=\"\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=\"\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\n\n\nThese characters can\u2019t stop the rock from falling, but they can at least move quick enough to get out of its path. And getting out of that path is the first step toward achieving real change in Westeros.", "episode_9": "\nWelcome to another season of Game Of Thrones reviews for those who have not read the books the series is based on. Since critics won\u2019t be receiving screeners this season, each week I\u2019ll publish the episode page once the broadcast ends and add my review to the page when I finish. That way newbies have a spoiler-free place to discuss the episode as soon as possible. As such, spoilers are strictly forbidden. Any spoilers in comments will be deleted on sight. Remember: Discussions of things that were different in the books or confirmations of things that won\u2019t happen count as spoilers, too. Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.In lieu of parsing all those interviews in which everyone swore up and down that Jon Snow was deader than dead\u2014you have to admit he was actually somewhat less dead than dead\u2014I\u2019ll start with the Previously On: Seeing Robb and Cat discuss the Karstarks was a blast from the past. What initially hooked me about Game Of Thrones was the expansion. For a while it kept growing, getting outwardly bigger and inwardly intricate, and then it stopped. The Iron Islands were abandoned, Dorne was put on hold. Once the writers started abandoning active characters left and right, the spell was broken. Season three was the last big push. That\u2019s how long it\u2019s been since the writers followed several lost characters reintroduced or referenced in \u201cHome.\u201d Balon Greyjoy hasn\u2019t been seen since that season\u2019s finale, \u201cMhysa,\u201d when he receives a gift in the mail from Ramsay. Gendry\u2019s been rowing since that same episode, but his magic pubic leeches finally come through with Balon\u2019s murder. Thoros Of Myr and Beric Dondarrion were cut loose even sooner, but they pave the way for Melisandre to bring Jon Snow back to life. And in the North, there are two notable lords from season three who have betrayed the Starks for House Bolton. The first is House Karstark, whose new lord holds an understandable grudge against Robb and a less understandable grudge against what remains of his decimated family. You won, dude. Let it go. The second is House Umber, to whose stronghold Osha is trying to shepherd Rickon \u201cOh, yeah\u201d Stark once they split up with Bran, also in season three. No word on the Blackfish\u2019s singlehanded resistance of the Frey forces, but at least we got to check in with Hot Pie in season four.Given how little Game Of Thrones has cared about the Iron Islands rebellion, the, um, overthrow of Balon is a masterpiece next to the Dornish coup. Now, I\u2019ve been waiting for that man to drop dead since the leech sacrifice, and it\u2019s clearly time once he steps out onto one of the long rope bridges between towers of Pyke, swaying in the wind during a storm in the dark. At first he looks like he might be having a heart attack. Then that he\u2019s just trying to steady himself. Either way, he\u2019s going overboard. So Doran\u2019s death is played for surprise and Balon\u2019s suspense, but there\u2019s a specificity, a strangeness to Balon\u2019s murder that its counterpart lacks. Nature doesn\u2019t take him, nor does accident. His wayward brother appears shadowed in a cloak at the opposite end of the bridge. Since we haven\u2019t kept up with the Greyjoys, we have to get through some exposition about this guy, but it\u2019s weird, spooky exposition befitting the costume and the setting. \u201cI am the storm, brother.\u201d Who is this guy? What\u2019s his deal? Might he actually be a better ruler than Balon? He boasts of his fearsome reputation. Balon counters with his reputation for madness. Before you can say, \u201cWho is he to talk?\u201d Brother Greyjoy has thrown Balon off the bridge. The destinations are the same\u2014a king (lord, prince, whatever) killed by his family in an attempted coup\u2014but the journeys are notably different. In Pyke they\u2019re trying to tell a story with atmosphere and ambiguity. In Dorne they\u2019re just checking boxes. For some reason Yara concludes that somebody killed Balon. Never mind that Balon is the 37th drunken Ironborn to fall off those ridiculous bridges this year. No, she means to investigate. But before Balon\u2019s corpse is even out of earshot, the Drowned God priest usurps her. He demands a kingsmoot, which if The Two Towers is any indication ought to be a rollicking conference. And we were seconds away from a woman essentially ruling the kingdom and two women ruling regions in rebellion.Here\u2019s the thing about this being the season of girl power: That\u2019s been the idea every year. The first season toppled the ruling patriarchs across two continents\u2014Jon Arryn, Viserys, Robert, Ned, and Drogo\u2014leaving wives and mothers to pick up the pieces. The season ends with Dany becoming the Mother Of Dragons. The dominoes fell, and the design spelled out, \u201cSlay kween.\u201d The cast was replenished by a witch who could survive poison, Margaery \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a queen, I want to be the queen\u201d Tyrell, and two warrior women in Brienne and Yara who distinguish themselves from their cartoon Dornish cousins by showing signs of conflict, personality, and general inner life. All four of them have managed to survive every authorial ambush since. We meet powerful men like Renly and Stannis and watch them die so the women they introduce can achieve their own agency. See also: Craster and Gilly from one end of the patriarchy spectrum and Oberyn and Ellaria from the other. Tywin\u2019s dead, Joffrey\u2019s dead, Tommen\u2019s got a prophecy hanging over his head. All the while, the women are learning from the best (Sansa, Arya) and taking matters into their own hands (Cersei). Now every Lysa has her Littlefinger (and every Shireen her Melisandre), but them\u2019s the breaks in such a harsh world depicted by such adolescents. The point is that the story has made severe underdogs of a whole gender from the start. For the entire run of the show, it\u2019s been triumphant to watch the women take over. But at least since Cat took Tyrion hostage, that triumph has been bittersweet. The women either have to lose and struggle and endure to achieve agency, or they wield it with the same selfishness and short-sightedness as the men. However impressive it is for Cersei and Ellaria to attain their respective thrones, they\u2019re not great leaps forward. They\u2019re steps back. Yara might not be.Meera\u2014you remember, hunter girl, dead brother, skeleton grenadiers\u2014is another warrior woman introduced to the story by a man she outlived (Jojen\u2019s the one with the connection to Bran). She\u2019s been despondent about her time at the Three-Eyed Raven\u2019s treehouse. Bran gets to warg and play virtual-reality history and grow into a pop star, but she just gets to sit there with Hodor, n\u00e9 Willas. What I take to be one of the children tells her she won\u2019t be inactive for long. Bran can\u2019t stay at the tree forever, and he\u2019ll need her to protect him. For another subplot Game Of Thrones tabled, this scene is a welcome reintroduction. We skipped over all of Bran\u2019s boring superpower lessons, although I have no doubt Max Von Sydow makes a better teacher than Jaqen and the Waif, and we\u2019ve had to sit through every one of their lessons. In any event, we\u2019re apparently near the end of Bran\u2019s education. It seemed like only yesterday, etc.Other subplots are more obviously racing\u2014Arya\u2019s already back with Jaqen after passing the world\u2019s most obvious test, and Theon\u2019s already leaving Sansa\u2019s side\u2014but this one is racing in another way. On the surface, there\u2019s no plot momentum. Bran just witnesses a scene from his father\u2019s youth. But every other moment feels like a clue to something or other. Not just whatever Bran\u2019s powers are in general, but this vision in specific. Young Ned is training young Benjen, a reminder that Benjen might still be out there. Or is this like the time in season four when they kept mentioning Renly for no other reason than, to them, he existed? What\u2019s really trippy: Ned and Benjen reenact a scene of Jon and Olly word for word, head cradle for head cradle. \u201cKeep your shield up, or I\u2019ll ring your head like a bell.\u201d What the hell is going on here? Suddenly Lyanna races in on a horse. The show keeps reminding us of Ned\u2019s sister, and the story usually entails her being swept up on a wayward horse (by Rhaegar Targaryen). Finally, Bran discovers that Hodor isn\u2019t named Hodor. He\u2019s Willas, and he could speak. What happened to him? Does it matter? It\u2019s like the Greyjoy sequence, in which we learn not only of Balon\u2019s brother but the fate of the Iron Islands rebellion. Even though the plot isn\u2019t moving too fast, there\u2019s so much information it almost feels like it is. It\u2019s like Bran, physically staying put but mentally flying through story.The Bolton coup is more of the usual. The news that Walda gives birth to a boy is Ramsay\u2019s signal to consolidate power. Roose tells Ramsay that he\u2019ll always be the firstborn, and Ramsay replies, \u201cThank you for saying that. It means a great deal to me.\u201d Then right there in front of the new Lord Karstark and the maester messenger, father and son embrace, and one of them stabs the other in the gut. For one beautiful moment it could have been Roose taking care of a problem, but unfortunately, it\u2019s the other way around. Ramsay continues his clean-up by summoning Walda. One thing the producers have learned since crucifying Theon in season three is they don\u2019t have to show us so much to make our skin crawl. Every moment Ramsay spends with Walda and her baby is excruciating. He holds it in his arms, and your worst fears come out. The episode has already shown us two full-grown men smashed against a wall by giants (one biological giant and one\u2026unnatural giant). By the time he\u2019s lured his victims into the kennel and opened the doors of several cages it\u2019s not even scary anymore, but the producers don\u2019t let that stop them. Walda is made to beg for her life, the baby\u2019s screaming, and the dogs are barking. Just another day at Ramsay\u2019s house. The sadism is boring, but the plot is momentous. That\u2019s three great lords overthrown in two episodes, and Littlefinger is nowhere to be seen. What are the odds Mace Tyrell makes it back from Braavos?Strange as it is to see superconfident Melisandre so lost, it\u2019s even stranger to see Davos as her biggest ally. That hasn\u2019t happened since season three either, back when they both agreed the true war lies to the north. \u201cI assume you know why I\u2019m here,\u201d he says. She doesn\u2019t even look at him. \u201cI will after you tell me.\u201d She\u2019s so shaken that she sits out the battle. Just as Alliser is about to bust down the door on Davos\u2019 room, Edd arrives with a wildling army and a fucking giant who busts down the door to the courtyard. All the giant has to do is smash one pipsqueak archer (alas, not Olly) and the men lay down their weapons. Edd has Alliser\u2019s mutineers thrown in the dungeons, leaving only Team Jon to man Castle Black. For the entire series characters have been discovering that getting command is a lot easier than maintaining the loyalty of their people. That\u2019s why the Boltons are having trouble with the North, and the former Slaver\u2019s Bay is in the midst of a grand reopening. For the first time, a conquering leader might actually have the full loyalty of his people. I\u2019m getting ahead of myself, but everyone knew where this was going. Melisandre insists, \u201cThe Lord never spoke to me.\u201d Leave it to Davos to come up with a pithy response: \u201cFuck him then\u2026I\u2019m not asking the Lord of Light for help. I\u2019m asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.\u201d He\u2019s talking about how she survived poison and birthed a shadow demon. What he doesn\u2019t know is her visions of Winterfell could yet come to pass, and that the final leech has worked its magic. It\u2019s strange. Melisandre\u2019s zealotry knows no limits, but she genuinely believes she\u2019s serving the will of her god. All this time it could have been a purely selfish endeavor to manipulate and isolate a king. And clearly she was arrogant. Somehow I don\u2019t foresee a lot of humility after she finds out what happens at the end of \u201cHome.\u201d Which is, just when everyone thinks Melisandre failed to resurrect Jon, the room deserted, Jon gasps for air. It\u2019s like he was drowning. Which brings me back to Bran: \u201cI wasn\u2019t drowning. I was home.\u201d ", "episode_8": "\nWelcome to another season of Game Of Thrones reviews for those who have not read the books the series is based on. Since critics won\u2019t be receiving screeners this season, each week I\u2019ll publish the episode page once the broadcast ends and add my review to the page when I finish. That way newbies have a spoiler-free place to discuss the episode as soon as possible. As such, spoilers are strictly forbidden. Any spoilers in comments will be deleted on sight. Remember: Discussions of things that were different in the books or confirmations of things that won\u2019t happen count as spoilers, too. Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.Jon Snow was never very light-hearted, so I don\u2019t know if his time in nothingness changed him, but Castle Black has an awfully emo week. Sure, Jon died, experienced nothingness, and was forced to come back to hell, so he gets some license to mope. But it\u2019s not just him. The first sight of \u201cOathbreaker\u201d is Davos\u2019 teary face. He\u2019s awed to witness resurrection, but there\u2019s no joy in him. It\u2019s a purely solemn awe, like he\u2019s at a war memorial, which I guess he kind of is. The final sight of \u201cOathbreaker\u201d is Jon Snow suddenly quitting the Night\u2019s Watch. You\u2019d think he might have made preparations or consulted with his allies or maybe chatted up Davos and Melisandre (and Tormund, for that matter) to see what their plans were. Otherwise they might all be going the same way. Won\u2019t that be awkward? But, no. As soon as he\u2019s done overseeing the execution of the (first wave of?) traitors, he removes his crow cape and walks off trying to look cool.And look at the attempts at comedy. Except for a Pycelle toot, it\u2019s all long, slow, dragged-out unfunny scenes of miscommunication. I\u2019m thinking of the small council taking their ball and going home. One by one. Having to walk past the Mountain. Forever. Or Tyrion trying to get Missandei and Grey Worm to lighten the fuck up for once in their goddamn lives. I was hooting and hollering like a monkey all through \u201cHome.\u201d But that TV writer thing when a character is plainly making an attempt to be jovial and is met with stone faces is never funny, except sometimes on Gilmore Girls.Now, technically Jon\u2019s abandonment doesn\u2019t qualify as a broken oath. You take the black until you die. The real oathbreakers at Castle Black are Alliser, Olly, and the extras. Actually, they did get a couple names, which is more than I can say for either Greyjoy uncle or the crone queen of Vaes Dothrak, who will actually be sticking around. Apparently the Greyjoys are Aeron (priest) and Euron (pirate). Not to be absolutist, but I really think a good story ought to name its characters within the text instead of treating one\u2019s basic identifier as insider knowledge. The Wire is more forthcoming than this. The basic lack of diligence speaks to the rush. Game Of Thrones is far more interested in meeting its deadlines than telling its story. I can see why some fans are willing to wait forever to get the story told more carefully from George R.R. Martin.Don\u2019t get me wrong. Things slow down all across the board in \u201cOathbreaker.\u201d No word on the Greyjoy succession, no visit to Ellaria\u2019s reign in Dorne, no check-in with Sansa\u2019s flight to Castle Black. Those frenzies are now calm enough to be off the table. Instead we get another history lesson with Bran, more governance and politics in King\u2019s Landing and Meereen, a boat ride with Sam and Gilly, and a prelude in Vaes Dothrak. Dany broke her oath to return to Vaes Dothrak to live out her widowhood with the dosh khaleen, and now her fate will be decided on by the khalasar convention (or KhalaCon). Sam broke his oath to stay with Gilly always, and now their fates will be decided by\u2026each other I guess? See, the slower pace doesn\u2019t alone solve the storytelling. It doesn\u2019t force the scenes to tell a story instead of hitting exposition or trying for filler jokes. Several subplots end with suggestions so ambiguous they might not even have ended. As we leave Sam and Gilly, it certainly doesn\u2019t play like Gilly\u2019s going to go stay with Sam\u2019s folks for a while. It plays like they\u2019re having a fight, and that fight is not over. That kind of ending happens a lot, raising the question, what\u2019s the point? What are the producers saying with this? For instance, Tyrion and Missandei talk about responding to the masters in the only language they understand, and everyone in the room knows exactly what they\u2019re talking about and everyone in the audience (okay, me) wonders what it is. Or Team Cersei (Qyburn and his new assembly of little birds, Ser Gregor the Frankenmountain, and Jaime) coming into conflict with the King\u2019s Council (Kevan Lannister, Maester Pycelle, Mace, and Olenna) to no apparent purpose. Like Bran yanked out of history, these sequences are just truncated enough to frustrate. All appetizer and no entree.Well, there are some entrees, but let\u2019s stop with the eating metaphors before we get to Ramsay. The producers take their time shaping some of the bigger scenes and still manage to reach momentous stopping points, as in the Arya subplot. The thing is, we\u2019ve seen this one already. Arya gets beaten every time she lies. Last time she actually manages to lie convincingly. This time she manages to tell the truth without lying? In any event, we get a montage of people beating a blinded Arya with sticks, which is a lot more painful than the producers seem to get. Eventually she manages to defend herself even though she\u2019s blind, and Jaqen offers her the lead-based fountain water. It comes with an ultimatum: If she\u2019s truly no one, she has nothing to fear. But he has to be pretty sure she\u2019ll pass this test, or it\u2019s even crueler than the blinding. And as a viewer, I\u2019m not confident she\u2019d pass yet. Not three episodes ago she was very much Arya Stark. But she passes nonetheless, and her vision is restored. Does that mean she\u2019s truly no one? Who\u2019s administering this test?Another biggie is the great Lord Umber scene. The new Lord Umber, like the new Lord Karstark an heir to a man we met in seasons past, refuses to adhere to tradition, becoming the second person to say, \u201cFuck oaths,\u201d this season. This new generation, I swear. He also refuses to maintain the pretense that Roose Bolton was poisoned by \u201cenemies,\u201d and given his level of detail, word is clearly getting around. But he does want to unite with Bolton and Karstark. To prove it, he offers a gift: Osha, Rickon, and the head of Shaggydog. Those first two are still alive, at least long enough for Ramsay to say, \u201cWelcome home, Lord Stark.\u201d It\u2019s a nice twist and it\u2019s well built to. But can we go two weeks without someone we care about in Ramsay\u2019s grasp? Okay, three? Speaking of fucking oaths, is tradition the latest governing structure to disintegrate in the face of all that\u2019s happened? In Westeros you can\u2019t count on the climate, history, science, family, marriage, or the government most days anymore. Miracles are getting more frequent. And look at the narrative entropy: two houses at war, then five, then scattered bands of people, now all kinds of political confusion and rulers who can barely maintain their capitals, the rest of their territory be damned. The violation of guest rites used to be a shock. Now we have multiple examples of people killing their own family, by blood or law: Lysa, Tyrion, Stannis, Ramsay, Ellaria, Euron, and the new Lord Umber in his fantasies. As Rowan Kaiser writes in this great piece (tread lightly, spoilerphobes), Game Of Thrones is partly designed as a subversion of historical fantasy values like chivalry. At this point we\u2019re all the way back around to being surprised when honor and loyalty succeed.The greater question is whether it might not be better for the people at large to overthrow the governing structure of tradition. For Dany to reject widowhood in a nation she was sold to, to reform Dothraki pillaging practices in whatever small part she could manage, to liberate the slave coast. Hard to argue with her rejection of tradition in concept. Only the execution has been frustrating. Should a new lord then be free to overturn an eon of Northerner loyalty to the Starks and throw in with the new power? It sounds awfully Lannister of him, but theoretically self-determination expands freedom. Everyone talks about the Northerners like they\u2019re a particular species of hard-headed warriors loyal to their own, but that\u2019s not genetics. It\u2019s tradition. If there\u2019s a problem with the new Lords Karstark and Umber choosing a different path for their people, and suspect there is, it isn\u2019t the choice. It\u2019s the short-sightedness.Castle Black is a place run on tradition, some enshrined in law (no sex), others frattishly passed on from one generation to the next (no wildlings). Nowadays everything about it feels vestigial, including the wall, which has been climbed over on-screen\u2026twice. Crows were already running low before the battle, and between the casualties and the mutineers, they\u2019re down to Edd and some extras. To add insult to injury, those casualties were made by the crows\u2019 new allies. Speaking of the wildlings, a hell of a lot of them died in the battle as well, Mance Rayder was later executed, and a great deal more were massacred during the immigration expedition to Hardhome. The castle has no lord commander, no ruling council, no first ranger, no maester, and a woman. It\u2019s nothing like it once was. But what it once was is a culture that led to Sam\u2019s bullying and Gilly\u2019s attempted rape and Alliser\u2019s mutiny. Now Edd has a chance to remake it better than it was, in structure if not in manpower.King\u2019s Landing isn\u2019t even run by the small council anymore. Or maybe it is. Like I said, we don\u2019t actually get a sense of the governing here. But the cumulative sense over the past season is the sparrows could put up a decent resistance, and they have hostages. Excuse me, penitents, or impenitents as the case may be. The queen mother can\u2019t even leave her own castle, and I realize that sounds like first-world problems, but it still goes to show how precarious the situation is outside. And while the High Sparrow is an infuriating demagogue, it is somewhat enjoyable to see this religious check on the power of the throne. They\u2019re the twin pillars of the world, Cersei tells Tommen via the High Sparrow. Except they\u2019re not twins. The crown has no check on faith. Or does it? The crown has the money and the weapons and the soldiers. This reminds me of Varys\u2019 riddle to Tyrion about the king, the priest, the rich man, and the sellsword.But once again King Tommen squares off with the sparrows, and once again Tommen is easily defused. In fact, such a good-natured boy might actually be buying what the High Sparrow\u2019s selling. Not to the extent that he\u2019ll cut a wheel in his head any time soon, but he\u2019s been brought up to appreciate the words of the gods. And here\u2019s this holy man telling him, \u201cThere\u2019s so much good in all of us. The best we can do is help each other bring it out.\u201d What would Joffrey do? He\u2019d have the Hound kill the High Sparrow well before he got to that line, come what may. But Tommen tries talking and listening, and he finds wisdom in the High Sparrow\u2019s words. He doesn\u2019t seem to realize he\u2019s playing the game. Overthrowing the monarchy of King\u2019s Landing, or at least resisting it, might be better in the long run for the citizens of the city. But religion is another governing structure, and one that appears to be just as arbitrarily despotic. They haven\u2019t broken with tradition. They\u2019ve just traded one for another.Stray obsevations\u201cOathbreaker\u201d is written by David Benioff and DB Weiss and directed by Daniel Sackheim.Melisandre: \u201cStannis is not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be.\u201d Listen, I\u2019m all about standing up for those prophecies of hers that are still possible. But at some point, someone needs to tell her about confirmation bias. She burned a child because she was sure Stannis would win Winterfell\u2026because she saw herself walking the castle. Christ, lady.Jon: \u201cI\u2019m not a god.\u201d Tormund: \u201cI know that. I saw your pecker.\u201dBran\u2019s visions are as fun as they are total semantic loopholes to Benioff and Weiss\u2019 \u201cflashbacks are lazy\u201d rule. They try to claim there\u2019s a fundamental narrative difference because Bran is watching them. No. Anyway, this week Bran sees his and Meera\u2019s fathers face off with Ser Arthur Dayne, the knight Rhaegar left to guard Lyanna in a tower somewhere. It\u2019s a thrilling fight, but just seeing Ned (even non-Sean-Bean Ned) is a thrill. And Bran learns one of the central lessons of this show: Official history isn\u2019t the same as objective truth. See also: Who poisoned Jon Arryn, and who the crown and the gods say poisoned Joffrey.At one point Bran calls out, \u201cFather!\u201d Shortly afterward, Ned stops and looks around. Did he hear him?Bran: \u201cWhat\u2019s in the tower?\u201d The Three-Eyed Raven: \u201cThat\u2019s enough for one day.\u201d Tease.Tyrion tells Missandei and Grey Worm, \u201cA wise man once said a true history of the world is a history of great conversations in elegant rooms.\u201d \u201cWho said this?\u201d \u201cMe, just now.\u201dVarys: \u201cMen can be fickle, but birds I always trust.\u201d The little birds are the poor children of whatever town he\u2019s in. He\u2019s cultivating new ones\u2014not in a creepy way\u2014in Meereen, and Qyburn has taken over\u2014again, nothing creepy about it\u2014in King\u2019s Landing. In one case Qyburn offed a boy\u2019s abusive father. It\u2019s always so unsettling when something relatively good happens.Lady Olenna is here to raise some hell. She tells Cersei, \u201cYou are not the queen, because you are not married to the king. I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.\u201d God, yes.R.I.P.: Ser Alliser, Shaggydog, some extras, and Olly, ranked in the order I\u2019ll miss them. \u009c\n", "episode_32": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of       view  of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.\nI\u2019m writing this review, guys, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really processed what I just watched, not yet. I mean, I get it\u2014they\u2019re dead. Robb, Catelyn, Talisa, the rest of the Tullys, Robb\u2019s wolf, his unborn child. There wasn\u2019t any uncertainty about what we just saw\u2014the show doesn\u2019t want us to have any false hopes, and neither did it want to be cartoonish about it. I don\u2019t know what the toughest part to watch was. Talisa\u2019s stabbing in the stomach (a work of overt symbolism by the Freys) was maybe the most graphic, but where Catelyn was emotionally, after all the horrors she\u2019s already suffered, and that final scream she let out, well, it\u2019s hard to think about.\nI have long felt doom and portent surrounding Robb, ever since he married Talisa. In a world this obsessed with procedure and honor and the breaking of trusts, there was no way he could get out of his broken promise to Walder Frey easily, and the show kept reminding us of that, but subtly\u2014we never really saw or heard much of the Freys again, and everything was probably kept quiet to keep us away from this brewing twist. Also, everyone who hasn\u2019t read the books and watches the show has friends who have read the books, and has probably suffered annoying hints or winks about some huge event on the horizon in season three.\nThat is to say, I was prepared for rough shit to go down. I figured that Robb was in trouble, one way or another. The beheading of Lord Karstark signaled the end of his military chances, and while Robb had his plan to invade Casterly Rock and turn the tide again, tonally things had gotten very moody and grim in the Stark camp. Obviously the invasion plan was a red herring, but a necessary one not just to keep viewers distracted but also to get Robb back in the Frey household. He\u2019d have no reason to poke that hornet\u2019s nest otherwise.\nBut I didn\u2019t expect the sheer brutality of the final scene, nor did I expect such a high body count, nor nasty little twists like Roose Bolton delivering the final blow with \u201cthe Lannisters give their regards\u201d (an echo of his kiss-off line to Jaime a few weeks ago) or Arya being there, once again, to see the Starks decimated and her hopes lost.\nOof. I can only imagine what the unspoiled are thinking. My Twitter feed has certainly been blowing up, but not with much consternation or rage, more like melancholy and exhaustion and a feeling of shellshock. There\u2019s no way the show can\u2019t cut to black after Catelyn\u2019s throat is slit. But that\u2019s also an upsetting, tragic note that\u2019s impossible to forget. It\u2019s haunting stuff, and it\u2019s to Game Of Thrones\u2019 credit that the scene hits as hard as it does. Catelyn has only had a handful of scenes this season, although many of them have been powerful. But we\u2019re still so rooted to these characters, especially the Stark family, that losing them feels colossal. Obviously, any time a show kills off a well-liked character, it\u2019s a big deal. But there\u2019s often some reason\u2014maybe a storyline wasn\u2019t working out, maybe an actor wanted to leave to become a movie star, maybe the show was in desperate need of a twist for ratings. But this comes right from the novels, so the sense of epic tragedy is totally earned. We\u2019ve been building to this nightmare for more than two seasons; we just didn\u2019t totally know it.\nAs a work of gripping serial television, how was this episode? It\u2019s almost impossible to grade, much like all of Game Of Thrones\u2019 big event episodes. But I think it worked pretty darn well. The Frey castle was foreboding as ever, even though it was nicely dressed up for the wedding. David Bradley has such a great time with that miserable old fuck, and even though it\u2019s going to be tough to see any material concerning the Freys after this, I do hope we get a little more of him, because he\u2019s a memorably evil dude in a very specific way.\nFor example, you can believe that Frey is not going to do anything about Robb\u2019s broken promise in this episode, outside of publicly shaming/lusting after Talisa and taunting Edmure with his bevy of plain-looking daughters and granddaughters. Once Edmure\u2019s bride was revealed to be very comely, I knew something was up. It didn\u2019t fit with Frey\u2019s agenda so far, and it suddenly seemed like everything was just going to be a little too easy. Then the song kicked in (the titular song \u201cThe Rains Of Castermere,\u201d a Lannister victory song Cersei explained last week) and the doors closed, and, well.\nThe reveal of Roose Bolton as an ultimate traitor was wonderful, even though it had been so heavily foreshadowed in his dealings with Jaime back at his castle. But I just mean the actual reveal\u2014Catelyn tugging at his sleeve to reveal chain mail, such a clever little touch that speaks to Roose\u2019s practicality (earlier, he revealed he married the fattest Frey he could find, because he was promised his bride\u2019s weight in silver) and his utter ruthlessness. He doesn\u2019t even care that he\u2019s been revealed at this point\u2014whatever he\u2019s been planning, certainly with Tywin, is too far along to be halted now.\nBut, oh God. The wolf dying\u2014it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 that an animal\u2019s death can be even tougher to watch, but there it is, especially after all the wolf heroics in the rest of the episode. Arya\u2019s presence turned her season-long journey into something of a cruel joke, with only the Hound (whom she tried so desperately to flee) there to protect her at the end, an even less comforting (although possibly more helpful) friend than the Night\u2019s Watch man was in season one at Ned\u2019s execution. The dying Starks were given notes of heroism, of course\u2014Robb crawling over to Talisa, Catelyn making one last bloody, vengeful grab to protect her family (which fell deaf on Walder Frey\u2019s ears, one of the cruelest moments of the episode) but that\u2019s it, right? That\u2019s kind of it!\nWe still have Stannis, of course, but he\u2019s very much licking his wounds (by the way: one out of three pretenders to the throne is dead now. Good job, Melisandre). Daenerys is across the sea, but she has a way to go liberating slaves before she makes it to Westeros. The surviving Starks are children, scattered to the wind. The concept of northern rebellion is basically done. The Lannisters have won, at least for now, and in the worst way imaginable, but we\u2019ll be leaving season three on somewhat of a down note, it\u2019s impossible to deny.\nOther things happened in this episode, even though it was really 50 minutes of preamble to utter insanity. Jon\u2019s storyline, which had been dragging for weeks, kicked into high gear again when his inherent honor got the better of him\u2014he kills Orell in the subsequent battle, but I loved that moment of him jumping into the eagle in death, a creepy but clever concept for a warg (my question: can he jump back into another body, now that his is gone?). More surprisingly, he leaves Ygritte behind, even knocking her to the ground as she tries to protect him. Why? That I need to unpack (but I\u2019ll wait and see what episode 10 provides).\nIn another cruel twist, the whole battle happens in front of Bran and company, holed up in a far-northern fort, which serves to tell Bran that Jojen\u2019s visions are correct (Jon is with the wildlings) and activates a power apparently no one has as he enters the mind of Hodor to calm him down. Bran, then, is special, more so than any other we\u2019ve met, giving us a little more reason to be invested in his journey to meet the three-eyed crow. We also bid farewell to Osha. Somewhat ridiculously, the focus of the goodbye is on Rickon, whom we barely know as a character\u2014it makes sense that Bran would be broken-hearted to leave him, of course, but really it\u2019s Osha I\u2019ll miss (I can\u2019t imagine we\u2019ll see as much of her now).\nOver in Yunkai, Daenerys quickly leaps into action, which I appreciate. If Daario being around means things get done quicker, then I\u2019ll sleep with the guy, jeez. Jorah is (predictably) very prickly and suspicious of the dude, for both rational and irrational reasons. Barristan is more neutral, and Grey Worm digs him for some reason. The resulting battle as the three slip into the slave city is a blast to watch, and I wish we could have had more of it, just as a fun, gripping, gritty bit of action violence before the very real, graphic, upsetting violence that followed. I didn\u2019t completely follow why this three-on-40 victory meant the fall of Yunkai, but it sounds like Daenerys\u2019 status as liberator has followed her, so the slaves quickly rose up to greet her. All good. Again, we can unpack that more on an episode that doesn\u2019t feature the death of so many major characters.\nWhat does it mean? How is the next episode not everyone just sobbing or rubbing their eyes with disbelief? Apart from Tywin, who will of course do his version of cackling with glee\u2014he\u2019ll smile very slightly, get a squint in his eye, something like that. But everyone else should be as shellshocked as I feel. It\u2019s the only rational reaction.\n", "episode_3": "\nWelcome to another season of Game Of Thrones reviews for those who have not read the books the series is based on. Since critics won\u2019t be receiving screeners this season, each week I\u2019ll publish the episode page once the broadcast ends and add my review to the page when I finish. That way newbies have a spoiler-free place to discuss the episode as soon as possible. As such, spoilers are strictly forbidden. Any spoilers in comments will be deleted on sight. Remember: Discussions of things that were different in the books or confirmations of things that won\u2019t happen count as spoilers, too. Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for. Now that Arya\u2019s time in Braavos has turned out to be such a chore, the question people keep asking is: What was the point? If she goes back to Westeros without getting her diploma from Murder Monk U, why did we spend two seasons watching her endure its frustrating curriculum in the first place? Was it just an act of juggling\u2014keeping Arya in the air for whenever she really matters to the larger story?  (Photo: HBO)\u201cNo One\u201d isn\u2019t immediately forthcoming on that point. True to form, the Braavos scenes are poker-faced red herrings through and through. The episode opens on Lady Crane, a character the plot might have dispensed with already, leading us all to wonder why in god\u2019s name we\u2019re back at the stage. Then it teases the possibility of Arya becoming an actor\u2014maybe the only outcome worse than her finally getting to level whatever in Jaqen\u2019s cult. When the Waif shows up to spoil the mood, not only does she kill Arya\u2019s latest caretaker, but turns the sequence into yet another torture-thon. We\u2019ve seen this one before. It would make perfect sense for the Waif to feel like an unstoppable horror villain in this episode, if only the series hadn\u2019t already squandered those feelings on earlier sparring sessions. Instead the tension plays as tedium. And when the Terminator finally corners Arya, the episode cuts away right before the clash. The Many-Faced God is hell-bent on denying us resolution, dragging out Arya\u2019s apparent bleeding to death across two episodes and going on three. (Photo: Macall B. Polay/HBO)But the episode isn\u2019t over. We wind up in the House Of Black And White, and the most likely reason for that is correct: Arya won. She takes two important actions in the scene to come. She aims Needle at Jaqen, and he steps up to the point. \u201cFinally a girl is no one,\u201d he says. She tells him to shove it up his ass. \u201cA girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell, and I\u2019m going home.\u201d It\u2019s Daenerys-level contrived to get us fist-pumping, not that that keeps me from doing so. After all this, Braavos gives us what seems like definitive resolution.  (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)Frustrating as it is, I wonder how much more interesting the show would be if Arya had to worry that every new face she saw were a Faceless Man come to get her. Is Game Of Thrones getting soft in its old age? (Yes. The outsize sadism of season five paved the way for the equally exaggerated comforts of season six: resurrections, reunions, characters previously powerless gaining power.) But that resolution comes from Arya leveling up. She embraces who she is\u2014a Stark\u2014and she rejects who she\u2019s not\u2014\u201cno one.\u201d I\u2019m not sure she could have killed Jaqen, but she at least symbolically spares him, even though he admits to taking a hit out on her. This is a far cry from the girl who brutally executed Meryn Trant. That\u2019s why Arya defeats the Waif off-screen. It would have been impossible not to revel in that violence if we could watch it, and that would undermine the whole thing.Arya didn\u2019t necessarily need the House Of Black And White to dissuade her from her bloodthirsty path. She was already softening toward one target\u2014The Hound\u2014when she got there. (Now that she\u2019s gotten in Cersei\u2019s head a bit with Lady Crane, I wonder how coldly she could handle that execution.) She doesn\u2019t want to be the ruthless assassin as much as she thinks she does. She just wants to feel power again after helplessly losing her father to injustice. She\u2019s gravitated to a succession of surrogate fathers since. Tywin gave her espionage tips, The Hound gave her killing tips, and Jaqen strung her along. Now, for the first time, she\u2019s truly independent. And her time on the streets of Braavos shows she might actually be able to stay that way.In short, Arya\u2019s getting a second chance, an opportunity to break the pattern, just like her old buddy. While the late name characters are all murdered off-screen in \u201cNo One,\u201d the episode has no problem dispensing with extras. The Hound juggernauts onto a scene of four Bannerless Brothers, decapitating the first with a swing of an ax, slicing up a couple others, and lodging the blade between the fourth guy\u2019s legs. He\u2019s blazing a trail of corpses to the men who killed his friend. (\u201cYou\u2019ve got friends?\u201d \u201cNot anymore.\u201d) He finds them resting in nooses, awaiting execution by The Hound\u2019s old pals, Beric Dondarrion and Thoros Of Myr. Season six is so good with loose threads that I expect Gendry any day now. After negotiating with The Hound over who gets to execute which prisoners, Beric and Thoros convince him to join the Brotherhood. It\u2019s easy now that the somewhat kinder, gentler Hound has been primed for good works by the Septon. He\u2019s still an enforcer, but now he\u2019s working for a ragtag resistance group instead of royals. (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)Old enemies Beric and The Hound feel like old friends here. There\u2019s a sense of situational loyalty at Riverrun, too. Jaime and Brienne are on opposite sides, but they each share the other\u2019s confidence. Similarly, Bronn helps his potential combatant, Pod, learn to fight without honor. None of this is the way things are \u201csupposed\u201d to be, exactly. Soldiers aren\u2019t supposed to help their enemies. The Hound isn\u2019t supposed to have such an easy rapport with his former captors, nor Beric with his former, um, killer. But with the endless war chipping away at governing systems, personal history with someone feels a lot more reliable than military procedure. That\u2019s the heart of the drama at Riverrun, when a poor confused Tully soldier doesn\u2019t know whether the Blackfish or Edmure is the salient Lord Tully. He settles on Edmure, the self-professed \u201crightful lord of Riverrun.\u201d In that decision, the soldier essentially forfeits the castle and the Blackfish. He followed the rules. The rules were a trap. He might have done better (for himself and his lord) by sticking with the Tully he\u2019s been with throughout the siege. Then again, the way things were going, if he had obeyed the Blackfish, they might both have been killed by Tullys loyal to Edmure. Instead, the Blackfish gets a second chance to stop his pattern, too. \u201cI\u2019m not running again,\u201d he tells Brienne. He dies fighting off-screen, and another battle is over and done with. (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)The battle at Meereen is only beginning. In fact, the Meereen scenes are almost narratively pointless until the Masters\u2019 armada arrives. Varys is off to shore up support in Westeros, and he shares a surprisingly flat moment with Tyrion. It\u2019s meant to be a significant farewell from one comrade to another, but it\u2019s hurried and half-hearted. Still, the attempt is part of the episode\u2019s concerted effort to bring more life into all this narrative momentum. Hence the Brothers having a bawdy conversation, Arya and Tyrion both fantasizing about their futures (she wants to see what\u2019s west of Westeros, he wants to own a vineyard where he makes wine for his friends), and that long sequence where Tyrion, Missandei, and Grey Worm trade \u201cjokes.\u201d Those aren\u2019t condescending quotes. The whole point is that they\u2019re only questionably jokes. Unfortunately, the Masters crash the party with a fleet full of trebuchets. The view is magnificent, but far too short. The siege has barely begun when there\u2019s a thump on the roof of the great pyramid, and in walks Dany, Drogon flying off in the background. (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)The far more successful overthrow of a queen occurs in King\u2019s Landing, where the High Sparrow has now persuaded Tommen to forbid trials by combat after The Mountain rips off a sparrow\u2019s head. The new world order is inescapable. Sparrows invade the Red Keep. Tommen\u2019s busy praying. Kevan, whom we really ought to know more about, relishes putting Cersei in her place. Watching Lena Headey process the events of the throne room is the draw of the episode. She acquiesces to the indignities of not having been informed Tommen was making an announcement and having to watch it from the gallery. She gets visibly unnerved when she processes the news that The Mountain won\u2019t be able to defend her\u2014not legally, anyway. And she\u2019s finally lost when she chases after her son only for him to dodge her. The question is how much of this is credible. Tommen may be suggestible, but how is he so resolute in turning his back on his mother? Especially given their scenes together this season. Just because you start praying doesn\u2019t mean you immediately tithe 90 percent to the church. Indoctrination takes time. And is he really too stupid to know what kind of impact his mother\u2019s trial might have on the legitimacy of his reign? The High Sparrow is winning, and worse, he sounds right, cloaked in a garb of poverty, humility, and compassion. He might have finally, completely cornered Cersei. Unfortunately for him.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.I didn\u2019t expect my biggest cheer in an episode called \u201cBattle Of The Bastards\u201d to come from Meereen, but the episode\u2019s generous that way. We get two battles for the price of one in the ninth episode: Dany\u2019s rescue of Meereen and Jon\u2019s attack on Winterfell. In an odd season we might be watching someone we like brutally die, like Ned in \u201cBaelor,\u201d the Starks in \u201cThe Rains Of Castamere,\u201d and Shireen in \u201cThe Dance Of Dragons.\u201d Instead we get battles that\u2014like Tyrion\u2019s defense of King\u2019s Landing in \u201cBlackwater\u201d and Jon\u2019s defense of Castle Black in \u201cThe Watchers On The Wall\u201d and \u201cThe Children\u201d\u2014turn out well for the relative good guys thanks to the last-minute arrival of foreign armies.\u201cBattle Of The Bastards\u201d misses Neil Marshall\u2019s specificity, but \u201cHardhome\u201d director Miguel Sapochnik realizes the grandeur of every movement of his battles: the dragons torching the Masters\u2019 fleet, the cavalry sweeping in to take care of the stragglers, Rickon\u2019s run, the Bolton phalanx backing Jon\u2019s forces against a wall of corpses, the \u201call is lost\u201d moment as a trampled Jon gasps for air beneath a pile of corpses. For a moment it\u2019s convincing enough to make you wonder if Jon might die after all. It\u2019s the right show for that, after all. Photo: HBOBut it\u2019s the wrong season. I\u2019m not talking about the odd-even split. With a reported plan to wrap up the series somehow in just two shortened seasons, the end is in sight. So it\u2019s time for the good guys to start winning. And they haven\u2019t stopped, give or take a dozen second- or third-tier casualties like Osha and the Blackfish. It\u2019s a season of resurrections, from physical ones like Jon\u2019s and presumably The Hound\u2019s to narrative ones like the Brotherhood and Team Rickon. A couple seasons ago The Mountain\u2019s resurrection would have been a bad thing for the good guys, but now he\u2019s here to avenge Cersei against people the audience likes even less. Arya\u2019s on her way to the Stark family reunion just in time. Old friends like Bronn and Pod are given their own friendly reunion, and so are old enemies like Davos and Melisandre. Dany is finally ready to make good on her six-season promise to get to Westeros. And at last women who have been shafted by tradition and law are asserting power. No, only one outcome makes sense for \u201cBattle Of The Bastards.\u201dI\u2019m speaking in terms of \u201cgood guys\u201d and \u201cbad guys,\u201d because that\u2019s what they are at this point. There\u2019s plenty of moral gray to go around\u2014what\u2019s the right thing for a Tully soldier at Riverrun to do?\u2014and Dany\u2019s impending conquest of Westeros ought to be a fun examination of the audience\u2019s situational loyalties. But for the most part, we have heroes like Jon and Sansa, victimized underdogs who are growing into power, and villains like Euron and Ramsay, unrepentant killers who seize it.  Photo: Helen Sloan/HBOThat framework is bolstered by Dany\u2019s conversation with Yara. When Dany tries to get a dig in about what an awful ruler Yara\u2019s father was, Yara shoots back that they have that in common. Dany can\u2019t resist a smile. It\u2019s like when she was charmed by Daario, another warrior who managed to get past Dany\u2019s mighty authority face. Dany says it plainly: She and Yara had evil fathers who left the world worse than when they found it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave it better.\u201d That\u2019s not a bad way to distinguish between good guys and bad guys. Or at least those with good intentions from those with selfish ones. Dany\u2019s conquest is the murkiest part of Game Of Thrones. What right does she have to conquer Slaver\u2019s Bay, let alone Westeros? The way she sees it, she\u2019s the rightful queen of Westeros because she\u2019s the last surviving child of King Aerys, who was murdered by the Kingslayer. We\u2019re way past that now, thanks to Robert\u2019s Rebellion, but the legitimacy of the Baratheon reign might not matter if either Tommen dies, as the witch predicted, or Tommen\u2019s revealed to be Jaime\u2019s bastard, either of which seems imminently plausible. Like the Boltons, the Baratheons are all dead now. The \u201cmost legitimate\u201d successor might just be Daenerys after all. Then again, the laws that suggest Dany\u2019s the legitimate heir undermine her claim on account of her sex. Putting too much stock in what\u2019s legitimate chains you to some bad law. The Herod-ing of Robert\u2019s bastards was legitimate.What really makes Dany a hero isn\u2019t legal but moral. She wants to make the world a better place than when she found it. Which mostly means liberating slaves and ending pillaging practices. As Tyrion skeptically observes, she opens the door to independence and self-determination, and with no heirs, her reign demands a new, more considered succession plan than simple paternity. In short, Dany thinks we can all play nice without violently dominating each other. The problem is she wants to create such a world through violent domination. And so far, that\u2019s worked out okay for her. Meanwhile, Tyrion\u2019s stab at diplomacy only made the Slaver\u2019s Bay quagmire worse. Is the only way to achieve the greater good to impose it with an iron will?  Photo: Macall B. Polay/HBOTyrion asks if she has a plan, and she says yes, but all she really has are intentions: burn the fleet, crucify the Masters, yada yada yada. \u201cI\u2019d like to suggest an alternate approach,\u201d says Tyrion. Instead of destroying everyone who dares question the mighty Daenerys Stormborn, they focus on cutting off the head of the insurgency. Grey Worm tricks the three masters sent to negotiate with some wisdom of Solomon, killing the two who sell out the third. It\u2019s especially sweet because their case is that the third is lowborn. The victory is solidified in the symbolism of the surviving master kneeling before freedman Grey Worm. A moment later, Tyrion dwarfs him, too. Meanwhile Drogon, bigger than ever and flanked by his newly escaped siblings, focuses on a few lead ships, sparing most of the attacking fleet. When Dany first conquered Meereen she had every single master crucified, against the counsel of Barristan Selmy. Look how much better things work out for her with some restraint. She\u2019s learning how to rule in a way that\u2019s closer to her more liberal values. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a kinder, gentler way to conquer, too, but all in due time.Things come easy in Meereen in \u201cBattle Of The Bastards.\u201d The producers don\u2019t even try to pretend otherwise. The closest they get is stalling, like that brief window of time the masters think Dany\u2019s offering to surrender or that long wait until it\u2019s revealed which visitors have arrived. The best is when Yara reaches out her hand in alliance. Dany milks the moment for all it\u2019s worth. We know what\u2019s coming, but the tension only increases the excitement until at last Dany clasps her new partner. I haven\u2019t smiled that wide since Brienne swore fealty to Sansa. \u201cBattle Of The Bastards\u201d has a way of making the expected unexpected in the moment. It even tells us upfront the two major casualties of the battle for Winterfell. Sansa predicts the two major casualties, Ramsay and Rickon. Ramsay, sure. We\u2019re all hounds at this point, desperate for Ramsay\u2019s corpse. The producers have gone way above and beyond the call of duty on priming us for Ramsay\u2019s death. Whatever else happens during the battle, it\u2019s Ramsay\u2019s time. But Rickon didn\u2019t necessarily have to die. It\u2019s not likely he would have survived, but a boy can dream. Sansa cuts him loose, though, and she does it before the battle\u2019s begun. That tells us to cut him loose, too. Then, when his death actually happens, just after Ramsay\u2019s third arrow misses Rickon, running across the battlefield to his brother, it\u2019s surprising and unsurprising. He\u2019s so close to Jon, and it\u2019s happening so fast, and we don\u2019t see Ramsay nock another arrow, and then one flies through Rickon\u2019s little body just in front of Jon anyway.The title suggests a knock-down drag-out fight to the death, and even though Ramsay rebuffs Jon\u2019s offer for a one-on-one, the battle lives up to that brutality. The \u201call is lost\u201d moment is a long, tough passage in which Jon gets trampled into the mud as what remains of his force is penned in between a Bolton phalanx moving like a Death Star trash compactor and a wall of bodies. Jon\u2019s perspective is a strobe-like flurry of black shapes moving across white sky, none of it very distinct. Amid the sounds of battle we hear him gasping for air. You wouldn\u2019t think Jon would be resurrected simply to die again, but in the moment it\u2019s tense. Melisandre tells him the night before, \u201cMaybe you\u2019re only needed for this small part of [the Lord Of Light\u2019s] plan and nothing else.\u201d When the bodies atop Jon grow higher and higher, you start to wonder if that\u2019s true. Or if there\u2019s a reason that Sansa threatened to kill herself if the battle is lost. Or if maybe the knights of the Vale will arrive to save her but too late for him as part of the season\u2019s commitment to boosting women. I wasn\u2019t thinking about how ridiculous that would be for his story.It\u2019s not his story that needs reconsidering. The knights of the Vale save the day, with Sansa at Littlefinger\u2019s side. Jon, Tormund, and Wun Wun survive the phalanx maneuver, Tormund stabbing Lord Umber to death on his way out. Ramsay retreats to the castle, and for the first time he looks afraid. He\u2019s playing like he\u2019s still got this, but he looks nervous nonetheless. It\u2019s the beginning of the end for the new Joffrey. Wun Wun busts through the Winterfell gates like he did at Castle Black, only this time he\u2019s finally taken down by the enemy. Not that it matters for Ramsay. The Boltons are swiftly vanquished, all except him, and Jon beats his face to a bloody pulp. At long last, the man who spent a season torturing Theon, the man who spent a season torturing Sansa, the man who murdered Osha, Rickon, and his own family, is bested.At last Sansa appears, and Jon climbs off Ramsay. He\u2019s going to let her have this one. In the final scene, Sansa hoists Ramsay on his own petard, feeding him to the hounds he kept in Winterfell\u2019s kennel. I\u2019m not sure how they could possibly have orchestrated it, opening the doors to the kennels, installing Ramsay in the middle, and getting out before they attack, but whatever. The hounds dutifully wait until Sansa\u2019s done talking to come out and feast. He says, \u201cMy hounds will never harm me.\u201d She replies, \u201cYou haven\u2019t fed them in seven days. You said so yourself.\u201d He tries to get in her head, telling her he can\u2019t die because he\u2019s a part of her now. While it\u2019s the sorriest excuse for a mind game Ramsay\u2019s ever attempted, I wonder how much he has rubbed off on her. If this is a formal execution, the episode gives no indication. Okay, maybe the formality is somewhat beside the point. But surely this counts as cruel and unusual. It\u2019s hard to imagine Ned concocting such a scheme. Then again, Ned\u2019s dead. And as surely as this is cruel and unusual, it\u2019s also his just deserts, Ramsay\u2019s karmic reward for his deeds in life. Sansa walks off and can\u2019t resist a smile. Relishing someone\u2019s death seems so base, so Ramsay-like, but it\u2019s understandable for Sansa. She finally won. She won by outsmarting and outnumbering Ramsay. And now she\u2019s truly free. And yet. Joffrey\u2019s death is played for horror. That boy\u2019s bulging purple face is hard to look at. Ramsay\u2019s is more easily enjoyable. Even the cut away from the hound lunging at his face spares us any trouble. What a happy ending.I hate to look a gift-horse in the mouth, but like a lot of the triumphs of this speedy season, it\u2019s just a little easy. Ask anyone at the end of season five what they want to happen to Ramsay and the answer will be to have Sansa feed him to his dogs. Not that it doesn\u2019t cost her to get there, but for once the expected doesn\u2019t feel unexpected at all. It feels mechanical.I\u2019m only concerned because of all the warning signs, like Sansa\u2019s secrecy. Was she afraid Jon would reject Littlefinger\u2019s help? Was she swayed by Littlefinger\u2019s offer to have an army loyal to her rather than her half-brother? Maybe she was hoping she wouldn\u2019t need the knights of the Vale but wanted them there in case. More than likely, this will be the most merciless Sansa will ever be as a queen. More than likely her life through the end of the series will trend upward. It\u2019s just that Game Of Thrones keeps preaching non-violence while practicing violence. If it has any conviction at all, things like Ramsay\u2019s execution wouldn\u2019t be quite so satisfying.Now we\u2019re back to that question that\u2019s been dogging the season\u2019s Essos arcs: What was the point of the last few years? We\u2019re back where we started, in a way. The Starks are back in power in the North. The Bolton rebellion has been so thoroughly quelled that there will never be another Bolton, and history will rightly remember the family for its betrayals. Maybe the Dreadfort will become a museum. Meanwhile Arya\u2019s on her way from Jaqen to Winterfell, and Dany has successfully conquered Slaver\u2019s Bay and looks westward. But things have changed for these characters in the intervening seasons. Battles have tested the survivors, coalitions have expanded, and first instincts have been tested. What happens now couldn\u2019t be more in keeping with the season\u2019s tone: second chances.", "episode_1": "\nWelcome to another season of Game Of Thrones reviews for those who have not read the books the series is based on. Since critics won\u2019t be receiving screeners this season, each week I\u2019ll publish the episode page once the broadcast ends and add my review to the page when I finish. That way newbies have a spoiler-free place to discuss the episode as soon as possible. As such, spoilers are strictly forbidden. Any spoilers in comments will be deleted on sight. Remember: Discussions of things that were different in the books or confirmations of things that won\u2019t happen count as spoilers, too. Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.I once read that George R.R. Martin considers the Red Wedding the end of the first act of his story, with the practical end of the War Of Five Kings and the diaspora of the Starks. With the Red Septing, \u201cThe Winds Of Winter\u201d marks the end of the second. It\u2019s the tidiest episode since the pilot, leaving just enough loose ends to bind the body of the story to the final act\u2019s direwolf head. Dany finally sets out across the Narrow Sea with allies in the South. Lyanna Mormont rallies the North and the Vale to Jon Stark\u2019s side. And Cersei takes out every political power in King\u2019s Landing in a single move, leaving the Iron Throne hers for the taking. It was fun rooting for her while it lasted.Actually, it\u2019s even tidier than that, barreling through any potential complications just so it can get to its ending points. Take the Dorne bookend. The very term, Dorne, embodies the second act\u2019s shortcuts by being a no-fuss catch-all for anywhere in Dorne, most often its capital, Sunspear. In my day you had to learn the sigils and the words for the lesser houses to understand what was going on. Olenna arrives in mourning, and Varys is on his way out because he has to get back to Meereen in time for Dany\u2019s departure. He can\u2019t just wait for her to get there for some reason. Anyway, he\u2019s there in Dorne to help broker an alliance between the Tyrells and the Martells on one side and the Targaryen queen on the other. So what has Ellaria been doing all this time? Ever since she took out her region\u2019s ruling men for their inaction against the Lannisters? Apparently she\u2019s been busy waiting patiently for the narrative to activate her. And the Dornish citizens who abetted or accepted her coup? They\u2019re fine. Real go-with-the-flow types, unlike every single Dornish character with a name. For that matter, what has Olenna been doing? Did they intercept her on the road, or was she raising an army, or is she army-less because the Tyrells are out of power now? Who\u2019s to say? All that matters to the producers, even more than the sight of her learning what happened to her family, is that she join Team Dany. Meanwhile Dany agrees, at Tyrion\u2019s behest, to leave Daario behind to keep the peace in Meereen while she\u2019s gone. Yes, there\u2019s peace in Slaver\u2019s Bay\u2014make that the Bay Of Dragons. Dany decisively ended the insurgency. But what about the ex-slaves who were unhappy with the free life? On the one hand, Daario\u2019s right: \u201cFuck Meereen.\u201d But Game Of Thrones can\u2019t make such a big deal about how hard it is for an occupying ruler to assert her own justice on a city and then just wipe its hands of the nitty-gritty. Or I guess it can. Welcome to season six.\u201cThe Winds Of Winter\u201d is a lavish feast where every course is popcorn. Major players make big moves, years-old questions are finally answered, and the universe is finally, satisfyingly tending toward order again. The payoffs are so magnificent there\u2019s very little time for consequence. Which isn\u2019t as big a problem as it sounds in the short term, at least not compared to all the shortcuts. There\u2019s time to wallow in the consequences later. For now the problem is that season six is hellbent on hitting the high points. By skipping to the ends, it diminishes its victories. That said, the Red Septing is the perfect narrative spectacle. The tantalizing cross-cutting of ceremony and violence reminds me of The Knick\u2019s first season finale. Game Of Thrones never does anything like this. Episodes are so regimented they rarely even cut back and forth between locations on the map. The sequence is so momentous Ramin Djawadi breaks out a new piano score for the occasion. The first shot is a view of the sept where everyone\u2019s gathered to enjoy the trials of Loras and Cersei, and the camera pulls back to reveal Cersei watching from her room, dressed in black with embroidered lions on her shoulders. Loras\u2019 trial is brutal, and the episode starts swinging big at the start: With Loras\u2019 confession, the Tyrell house becomes the latest great power to wind up heirless. But never say never. Roose legitimized Ramsay, after all. Whatever the faults of the season\u2019s pacing, by throwing so much at us, it gives you plenty to distract yourself with while it sets up the next huge moment. I was speculating about the prospects of House Tyrell until I realized what was going on. And then Cersei lit the match. Not personally. Qyburn and the little birds lure Pycelle and Lancel to separate ambushes. Lancel soon discovers he\u2019s bleeding out in the Mad King\u2019s wildfire cellar, well, wildfire cavern. A handful of lit candles are burning down atop some puddles, but there\u2019s no real suspense about whether Lancel can get there in time to blow them out. The real suspense is whether Margaery might get out. At least she goes down swinging, totally dropping her pretenses of piety, humility, and friendship with Cersei. Just in time for the wildfire demolition of the sept.So that\u2019s why we never got to know Kevan Lannister. Despite being hand of the king and one of the few people in Tommen\u2019s ear all season, he was just going to be meat. A name on a list for the producers to cross out when they needed a body count. Season six loves to deliver bodies; it just hates endowing the characters. Which is odd, because when it does, as in the case of Septon Swearengen, it gives us one of the best episodes of the show. Anyway, Mace Tyrell goes, too, although he may as well have never come back from Braavos. Loras is just as expendable lately. If he was so broken way back when he told Margaery, \u201cLet them win,\u201d why couldn\u2019t he confess then? That\u2019s how it worked for Cersei. Alas, Loras is just meat nowadays. The High Sparrow is the most satisfying victim of Cersei\u2019s villainy. His arrogance commits him to staying in the sept even though things are amiss. He\u2019s smart enough to realize Margaery\u2019s right, and even to show some worry as he looks around deciding what to do. But he essentially barricades the sept anyway. In those final moments, they all just wait to die. Which brings us to Margaery. Game Of Thrones didn\u2019t neglect her the way it did her brother and the others. She\u2019s probably had more scenes that aren\u2019t strictly plot propulsion than anyone introduced after the first season\u2014and they\u2019re among the show\u2019s best thanks to Natalie Dormer\u2019s calculated gaze. Think of her open-eyed, very kind offer to her husband King Renly, her suggestive stare with Joffrey and the crossbow, or her pleasant, passive-aggressive throwdown with the alcoholic queen mother at the beginning of the season. Margaery was even there for the pivotal introduction of Ser Pounce. (Okay, all these scenes are plot propulsion\u2014they\u2019re about Margaery advancing her own interests\u2014but they\u2019re less immediately consequential than most.) Meanwhile her sins are among the least tangible. So she only pretended to care about the poor? Her charity still did a lot more good for the commoners than anything Cersei\u2019s ever done. So she\u2019s ambitious? She\u2019d make a far better ruler than most characters. She didn\u2019t even have to compromise her own values too much until the sparrows came along. Given how things played out, the moment she lost is when the High Sparrow let her see her brother. She tells Loras not to play into the High Sparrow\u2019s hand, but her even being there with him is playing into his hand. That\u2019s when she made a deal she thought she could eventually get out of, once she and Loras were safely back in the keep. That\u2019s when one of the most successful power players on the continent is finally outmatched. The lesson: Come at the queen regent, you best not miss.Olenna doesn\u2019t cry, at least not on-screen. Like all survivors this seasons, she hardens. But you don\u2019t feel any change. This is a woman who has lost every living family member, her legacy, and potentially the source of her power over the citizens of the Reach. She might have an ally in Littlefinger if she could get word to him. She was theoretically engaged in rallying the troops (her last words to Margaery being, \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, my dear\u201d). She\u2019s alone and adrift except for her thirst for vengeance. And when we see her again, she\u2019s sitting on a veranda sassing her company, like always. \u201cThe Winds Of Winter\u201d keeps skimping on consequence. This is the opportunity to show us what the Tyrell deaths mean, and apparently all it can come up with is motivation for another character\u2019s revenge. After Tommen\u2019s suicide, Cersei shows Olenna how it\u2019s done. Given the way she took Joffrey and Myrcella\u2019s deaths, you might expect Cersei to show some reaction beyond anger. But she takes after Olenna, only more so. We have to have a big bad, as the screenwriting gods probably say, so she\u2019s back to being a pure villain. Her torture of Septa Unella is appropriately heartless. There\u2019s nothing left in the world that incites her compassion. She doesn\u2019t even show any reaction to Jaime, who looks awfully concerned about her coronation. I was afraid he was walking into his own wedding. Instead the scene harkens back to the Targaryen dynasty in a different way: a monarch who would burn their subjects. Slay, queen.That\u2019s the two-word idea behind the whole season, the bumper sticker plastered across a perforated bumper. Certainly it\u2019s satisfying to watch women like Sansa assert themselves. It would be more satisfying if it didn\u2019t feel so scripted. Her victory at Winterfell wasn\u2019t cunning. It wasn\u2019t even her victory. It was luck that Littlefinger showed up in time to save Jon\u2019s last 12 men, and it was obsession that led Littlefinger to pledge the knights of the Vale in the first place. She didn\u2019t manipulate him, and she didn\u2019t manipulate Jon. She just happened to have interests tangled up in theirs. And it feels like the producers think that\u2019s good enough for us to pump our fists. Sometimes it is. Don\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth.Arya has never looked more like her sister than when she gives Walder Frey an irrepressible smile as she holds his head back so he can bleed out. This is after she feeds his own sons to him. Don\u2019t ask how she managed to get to the Twins, kill Black Walder and Lothar, butcher them, cook them, and serve Walder. This is the Sand Snakes showing up on Trystane\u2019s boat all over again. It\u2019s not even clear how many people Arya needed to kill to make that happen. Maybe nobody noticed. Maybe every Frey man is dead. In any event, it\u2019s some satisfying revenge on a base level. Cersei better watch out. It\u2019s just that Game Of Thrones keeps talking a big talk about how violence begets only violence, and then it gives us scenes like this. Meryn Trant\u2019s execution is painful to witness. Everything from his nasty pederasty to his final muffled moan is disturbing. That seemed like the whole point. By contrast, Walder Frey\u2019s execution is a pep rally. Slay, Arya! Slay, Sansa! It\u2019s totally different when Starks do it.But there\u2019s nothing rah-rah about Cersei\u2019s victory, and that\u2019s what gives me hope the producers know what they\u2019re doing. \u201cThe Winds Of Winter\u201d is a dirge. A spectacular dirge, but a dirge nonetheless. After all, Castle Black is practically empty, several great houses are now heir-less, and the commoners are inevitably slaughtered by some marauding band or another. Look at the big picture and see what Cersei\u2019s viciousness has left her with, nothing but a throne. Dany breaks up with her boyfriend like she\u2019s laying him off, only with even less compassion than that. Now Arya skips going home so she can spend some time with the Freys, and it\u2019s treated like a triumph. Maybe for now. But Cersei is one logical endpoint for these young Stark women, and there\u2019s still time for them to swerve.One of the themes of the season I keep bringing up is hope. Season five was a death march, and season six is rainbows and kittens. The problem is those rainbows and kittens aren\u2019t earned simply because the characters survived this long. Just because Sansa endured Ramsay doesn\u2019t make it awesome that she accidentally won the battle that resulted in his death. Just because Arya\u2019s finally free of the Faceless Men doesn\u2019t mean she gets to suddenly appear wherever she wants on the map. The fewer steps you skip on the journey, the more we can savor the destination. It took almost no negotiating to unite Yara and Dany, and it took even less to bring the Martells and Tyrells into the fold. I\u2019m thrilled for Yara and Olenna, at least, but I\u2019d be a hell of a lot more thrilled if it hadn\u2019t fallen into their laps. Does all this mean anything, or is it just character rearrangements? That\u2019s the big loose thread that takes us into the final act. Sam\u2019s in Oldtown now, Melisandre\u2019s headed south toward the Brotherhood, Bran\u2019s by the Wall, and Euron\u2019s still out there somewhere. But the biggest question mark is one of substance. Can the producers get back to fleshing out the story, or are they just going to race to wrap everything up in reportedly 14 episodes? As \u201cThe Winds Of Winter\u201d shows, Game Of Thrones is capable of astonishing entertainment. But unless there\u2019s more to it\u2014motivation, consequence, the details of real life\u2014it\u2019ll just be a dazzling game of musical chairs.", "episode_7": "\nWelcome to another season of Game Of Thrones reviews for those who have not read the books the series is based on.

Remember: Discussions of things that were different in the books or confirmations of things that won\u2019t happen count as spoilers, too. Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.Now that is how you set the table. \u201cBook Of The Stranger\u201d doesn\u2019t just check off plot points. In fact, there aren\u2019t a lot of plot points to check off. It\u2019s an episode of introductions, reunions, and wall-to-wall scheming. No wonder Littlefinger finally returns to the fold. Sansa\u2019s strategizing with Jon, Cersei\u2019s spearheading a move against the Sparrows, Osha tries her damnedest to take out Ramsay. Finally the globe is a Risk board again, with all kinds of lords and ladies and once and future khaleesis deciding what to do with armies. The recurring idea is strong women, women in command, women refusing to shrink. Missandei weighs in on a momentous piece of legislation. Even imprisoned Margaery refuses to just accept her position, the way so many women have been forced to in the past. The result is another coup that turns out to be the latest effortless spectacle in Dany\u2019s conquest of a continent.That sense of strategy is what\u2019s been missing lately. The Dornish coup was meant to be a shock, but the opportunity cost is what\u2019s going through Ellaria\u2019s head beyond the simple, immediate victory of the throne in front of her. We still don\u2019t know whether she seriously means to go to war with the Lannisters, which has the accidental virtue of releasing us from more screentime in Dorne. Yara\u2019s ability to strategize has been hampered by the total loss of the war against the North and the kingsmoot being taken out of her hands. We don\u2019t really know what that is, but I suspect she could be out there glad-handing ship captains and kissing babies or doing something anyway, but we don\u2019t see that. For most of the past few episodes, Melisandre and Davos have been at the wall as free agents giving us no sense of their goals. What would they have done if Jon didn\u2019t come back? Hell, what are they intending to do now that he is back? All Jon\u2019s come up with since un-taking the black is he wants to get warm, a fine joke but another missed opportunity to reveal goals. Thank god Sansa arrives, so someone at Castle Black is thinking more than one move ahead.Sansa looks so much more mature now, sitting next to Jon and reminiscing about Winterfell. I\u2019m not sure all those near-misses between the Stark kids gives this reunion any more heft than it would have had otherwise, but it\u2019s a huge relief to see them together, not least because it\u2019s a conversation where people just shoot the shit, like people do. Jon even makes fun of himself! Eventually Sansa talks about the road not traveled, wishing she would never have gone with her father and that handsome Prince Joffrey to King\u2019s Landing. But this way, horrible as it\u2019s been, she\u2019s been disabused of her romantic fantasies, and she\u2019s watched the best schemers on the continent in action. The writers closed off pretty much every avenue for her to practice manipulating people at the Eyrie and especially at Winterfell with Ramsay, but at last she\u2019s making her mark on the world. Even before she reads Ramsay\u2019s taunting letter about Rickon, she urges Jon to retake Winterfell. She namechecks Arya, Bran, and Rickon in the process, and looking back it\u2019s almost surprising that there are still five of them (and Theon) still running around. Later she takes Jon\u2019s hand, physically appealing to him. All I could think of is Cersei\u2019s wicked queen moment when she grabs Tommen\u2019s cheek and sweetly says, \u201cI am your mother. You can always trust me.\u201d Sansa\u2019s no Cersei, but the use of a coaxing touch is the same. Best of all, Sansa doesn\u2019t let the scene end without telling us her goals. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take back the North, we\u2019ll never be safe. I want you to help me. But I\u2019ll do it myself if I have to.\u201dThey read the Ramsay letter later. I say \u201cthey,\u201d because Jon stops reading halfway through. Ramsay\u2019s threats are too grotesque, and he doesn\u2019t want to subject Sansa to that. But Sansa grabs the letter and finishes reading it out loud to the rest of their dinner table, the first of two lengthy descriptions of fantasized gang rape this episode. The other, Khal Moro\u2019s attempt to intimidate Dany, just serves to let us off the hook for savoring his demise. It\u2019s also sort of a test of Dany\u2019s fear, but Dany is an old hand at looking imperious and demanding foreigners serve her. Sansa refusing to be cushioned is a much stronger statement. The old Sansa really is gone. She reads the letter because she won\u2019t be intimidated by a man who imprisoned her, played mind-games on her, and repeatedly violently raped her. The implications are major. Refusing to be protected makes her a grown-up. Reading the letter where her brother wouldn\u2019t, and somewhat against his urging, makes her a leader. It\u2019s a Dany move writ small. And it\u2019s thanks to that letter that Tormund volunteers the wildlings to the cause. They won\u2019t be enough to retake Winterfell, but Sansa has a plan for that, too. The Northerners will fight for Jon. Fighting is the exact opposite of what Jon wants to do, yet Sansa gets him to do it. They\u2019re going to march on Winterfell, just as Melisandre\u2019s prophecy foretold. It\u2019s a thrilling, lively, human pair of sequences between Jon and Sansa, and all they\u2019ve done so far is scheme.\u201cBook Of The Stranger\u201d keeps presenting strong women next to weak men, or weaker men, or men who don\u2019t get their way at least. Yara\u2019s as unyielding as Balon, and Theon confesses to being broken. Like Sansa, Yara looks so much older all of a sudden. And like Sansa, she ultimately gets support from her brother. The small council scene is basically Cersei and Olenna taking decisive action, with Jaime and Kevan just there for moral support. It\u2019s telling that Olenna\u2019s the one choosing what to do with Tyrell armies, not Mace. As for the other Tyrells, Margaery gets front-row tickets to another beautiful performance by Jonathan Pryce, the camera slowly pushing in as he describes his rock-bottom moment, an Antonioni party that made him feel so empty he walked out the door and walked out of his life. She cooperates and even seems to find some connection with him, but as soon as the High Sparrow takes her to Loras\u2019 cell, she tells her brother not to play into their hands. \u201cYou need to stay strong.\u201d He replies, \u201cI can\u2019t stay strong. I never was strong.\u201d He\u2019s so out of hope it momentarily shocks her, but she tells him not to give in or they\u2019ll win. \u201cLet them win,\u201d he says. \u201cJust make it stop.\u201dThe result, as the High Sparrow anticipated, is Margaery sets a date for her walk of shame. It reminds me of what Grey Worm tells Tyrion about the masters. \u201cYou will not use them. They will use you. That is what they do.\u201d Manipulation is key to every good Game Of Thrones episode. Naturally it\u2019s prominent here. In addition to the High Sparrow and Margaery trying to play each other and Tyrion cutting a pretty sweet deal to the masters in exchange for cutting off the harpies, not to mention Cersei and Sansa, there\u2019s Osha. Her meeting with Ramsay has just about everything that makes Ramsay stories so bad: He\u2019s an unstoppable supervillain, she\u2019s made to be sexually compliant, he kills her, she\u2019s disposable, and he ends the scene with a stupid look to demonstrate how little notice he takes of death. But it\u2019s a good scene in and of itself\u2014and would be a much better one if Ramsay\u2019s sadism weren\u2019t so dull by this point\u2014because Osha is no shrinking violet. She\u2019s the one apparently in charge of the scene. Even though he\u2019s going to get the upper hand, he\u2019s not torturing her the whole time. Instead it\u2019s more like the producers are torturing us. There\u2019s a blade tantalizingly within her grasp if only she could reach it in time, and for a moment it almost seems like she might. She doesn\u2019t, and I\u2019m kicking myself for ever entertaining the notion, but she tries. It can\u2019t help but feel like they brought her back only to kill her\u2014as opposed to, say, her dying off-screen like Shaggydog, trying to keep Rickon out of Umber hands\u2014but it could have been so much worse.Vaes Dothrak gets off to a weak start. The writers are capable of beautiful monologues for Jonathan Pryce, a thousand improvised stingers for Olenna, a wrenching confession for Loras, and an honest-to-goodness joke for Jon Snow, but all they can imagine that transpires between Daario and Jorah several days into their crosscountry hike is a pissing match over Dany. Their plan to rescue her is just as blunderous, not least for asking us to buy that Jorah and Daario could get to her, in the center of the national convention of Dothraki, without going through more than two men. It\u2019s fitting that they have almost no effect on the episode\u2019s outcome. Dany rejects their help. She rescues herself.The writers had me right where they wanted me. Is Dany going to make some kind of proposal to Khal Moro? Can she sense her dragon nearby? She walks around the yurt shaming the lazy khals with Drogo\u2019s ambition. \u201cYou are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will.\u201d They\u2019re captivated by her story at first, but soon they all laugh. Khal Moro scoffs at the idea of serving her. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to serve,\u201d she tells him, and even then I was still expecting some small-scale solution, some kind of persuasive offer or something. But she continues, \u201cYou\u2019re going to die.\u201d First she places her hand on the giant torches in the center of the tent to demonstrate her superpower, and then she tips them over, setting the place ablaze. Daario and Jorah have killed the guards and barricaded the doors. The ruling khals go up in flame. And Dany alone can survive. It\u2019s a perfect Dany moment, because it requires her to talk a good game, look like a queen, and show off her superpowers, and it\u2019s elegantly simple. All she has to do is tip over the lamps. She\u2019s great at destructive spectacle. She walks slowly through the flames so every Dothraki in the crowd that\u2019s assembled can see she\u2019s fireproof, and just like last time, they all instinctively kneel before their khaleesi. Daario\u2019s awed, too, and it takes a lot to get through that smirk. The reason not knowing characters\u2019 goals has been frustrating at this point in particular is it\u2019s starting to feel like anything can happen. In season one, in a well-ordered and strictly structured kingdom, there weren\u2019t a lot of options for the characters. Everyone pretty much knew what their lives would look like. Now Dany holds the combined khalassar, three dragons, the Unsullied, and one to three cities. Ellaria sits on the throne at Dorne, Yara\u2019s on her way to ruling the Iron Islands, and Sansa, Cersei, and Olenna are commanding armies. It\u2019s hard to know what to expect from people now that they have so much more freedom.", "episode_6": "\nWelcome to another season of Game Of Thrones reviews for those who have not read the books the series is based on. Since critics won\u2019t be receiving screeners this season, each week I\u2019ll publish the episode page once the broadcast ends and add my review to the page when I finish. That way newbies have a spoiler-free place to discuss the episode as soon as possible. As such, spoilers are strictly forbidden. Any spoilers in comments will be deleted on sight. Remember: Discussions of things that were different in the books or confirmations of things that won\u2019t happen count as spoilers, too. Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.Valar morghulis, the high school jock nod of Westeros, soaks up all the attention. All men must die. It has a romance to it. But its decidedly less sexy counterpart is no less important to the bloody feudal politics of Game Of Thrones. Valar dohaeris, all men must serve\u2014that\u2019s the subject of \u201cThe Door,\u201d a two-hankie tribute to the people around all the anointed ones. No wonder the action stays out of King\u2019s Landing. (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)In the Iron Islands, a national convention of ship captains and super delegates elects a leader. They only get two choices, although the producers strive mightily to make us think it might be three. The music of temptation builds as Theon enters the circle and looks around at the men who view him as Balon\u2019s legitimate heir. But he points to Yara and tells them, \u201cShe is your rightful ruler!\u201d There\u2019s not much suspense here, but it\u2019s as meaningful a testament to Theon\u2019s growth as we\u2019ll find. The old Theon, the one who tried to take Winterfell, is gone. Now he might find redemption in service to people like Sansa and Yara. He\u2019s doing a good job rallying support, but he can\u2019t compete with Euron\u2019s insult comedy about Theon\u2019s good grooming as a hostage of the Starks and his torture as a hostage of the Boltons. Truly hilarious stuff. But Euron also makes some grand promises to the people. If they vote for him, he\u2019ll ally with Daenerys Targaryen, who must be in want of a fleet as well as a husband, and together they\u2019ll conquer the world. The Ironborn eat it up. Majority rules, Euron is anointed king, and Yara and Theon flee with the best ships and their loyal followers. Where might they be going? The producers never seem to care. In this case, I have no doubt they\u2019re just withholding that information so we have something to wonder about over the next week or so. Maybe they\u2019re headed to the Wall to pledge their strength to Sansa. Whatever the answer is, we\u2019ll likely find out. But right outside Vaes Dothrak, in the middle of a damn continent, Jorah tries to leave Dany to protect her from greyscale, and he just starts walking away. Where could he possibly have been going? Where did Jon Snow think he was gonna go before Sansa showed up? Did Davos have even a single destination in mind after the mutiny was quelled? We\u2019ll never know, because all three departures were forestalled by other events. But leaving questions like those hanging just makes smart characters look thoughtless. There are ways to serve the queen from afar, but not if you don\u2019t collaborate. (Photo: Macall B. Polay/HBO)Dany\u2019s back to being imperious about Jorah\u2019s betrayal and subsequent refusal to get lost. But as soon as he shows his arm, she cracks. She\u2019s visibly upset, her face continuously twisting into new expressions of that pain. Like Yara and Theon sharing a look across the convention floor, she shows a flood of feeling without bursting into tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she tells him. It\u2019s an impressive performance on its own, and all the more so coming from Emilia Clarke, who has essentially been practicing different ways to be icily authoritative over the past several seasons. It\u2019s a talent she wields for good at the end of the scene, commanding Jorah to remain in her service. He\u2019s been her greatest ally and asset for years now\u2014and I\u2019m including the dragons\u2014and it\u2019s such a relief to see her realize it. You can\u2019t buy service like that. But there is the problem of the greyscale, so she orders him to ride off in search of a cure. Again, I have no idea where that might be, but at least we know his goal. And something saved Shireen after all. (Don\u2019t say the Lord Of Light.) (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)The episode opens with a similar scene, only this time it\u2019s Sansa evaluating Littlefinger\u2019s service. It\u2019s brutal, and maybe more so for all it leaves to the imagination. \u201cDid he cut you?\u201d he asks Sansa at her command. She wants him to guess what horrors Ramsay inflicted on her body, and that\u2019s the only revealing question in the reverse interrogation. We know he beat her. Cutting her is different. And the rest she says ladies aren\u2019t supposed to talk about, even though the brothel they\u2019re in has heard worse. As always, it\u2019s a pleasure to see Sansa making her mark on the world, to borrow a phrase from Yara. But it\u2019s also a thrill to behold a scene all about a pivotal question: How loyal is Littlefinger to Sansa? In the pro column, there\u2019s his love for Cat and Sansa\u2019s resemblance to Cat. In the con column, he did tell Lysa, right before pushing her through the moon door, that Cat is the beginning and end of the list of women he loves. During their time together, Littlefinger seemed like he was giving Sansa decent advice. He certainly didn\u2019t seem to know much about Ramsay. But Sansa has a good point: If he, of all people, didn\u2019t know, then he\u2019s an idiot, and if he did, he\u2019s her enemy. Instead of an answer, we get another question. Littlefinger doesn\u2019t put up much of a fight to stay with Sansa, which is probably all the answer we need. He\u2019s no Jorah or Brienne. But he offers some parting advice: Reconnect with the Tully army at Riverrun, recently retaken by the Blackfish. The question is whether any of that is true. Because Sansa lies about the origin of that intel to her court, I suspect it\u2019s going to turn out to be false. Why would Littlefinger make that particular lie, though? He wants the knights of the Vale to make their mark on the world, but he can\u2019t just wield them to whatever end he wants. Some of them heard Lord Robin direct them to help Sansa. As usual, Littlefinger\u2019s plots feel like supervillain Rube Goldberg machines in action. Someday we\u2019ll finally have the finishing piece and everything will start to make sense as his next target drops dead. As for now, neither Sansa nor Brienne question the truth of his claim in so many words. Brienne does bring other concerns to her lady, and she does ask why Sansa lies to her brother, but that\u2019s as far as she\u2019ll go in her position as devoted knight. They could at least send a raven to Riverrun and wait to see how whoever\u2019s there replies. Alas, Sansa and company roll out, leaving Edd and, like, seven crows left to man the castle.  (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)The Braavos plot also brings up a long-running question to no avail, this one less intriguing but more so than usual. Is Arya ready to serve the Many-Faced God? She says she is. It\u2019s a reflex now. Unfortunately she never seems to give it much thought. Is she ready to give up on ever seeing her family again as Arya Stark? Is she ready to give up on her dreams of killing Cersei and Ilyn Payne and all the rest? These are the fundamental questions of this subplot, mostly subsumed under scenes of the Waif beating Arya up and the bare outlines of what is basically just a supernatural cult of assassins.  (Photo: Macall B. Polay/HBO)\u201cThe Door\u201d at least pokes at the dilemma. Arya\u2019s target is an actress, and the play she\u2019s performing when Arya finds her happens to be the royal struggle of Westeros. Arya witnesses an actor profaning her father\u2014reliving the moment of standing in the audience as Ned is beheaded before a raucous crowd of misinformed peasants, and she hears for I think the first time that her sister is betrothed to a Lannister. What better way to distract her from her purpose as a servant of (a rival actress by way of) the Many-Faced God? Unfortunately that dilemma is still barely there. Instead the most headstrong Stark kid\u2014and that\u2019s saying something\u2014is stuck training for a job she couldn\u2019t even identify when she started and itching to graduate without considering the consequences. \u201cA servant does not ask questions,\u201d Jaqen instructs. Maybe Arya Stark should reconsider whether she has it in her to be a servant. No matter how she comes down, the question is what\u2019s important here, not the call-and-response rituals of the Many-Faced God. (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)Another servant of another god, Kinvara the red priestess of Volantis, brings up some similar questions. She tells a skeptical Varys, \u201cWe serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t serve Dany. She serves the Lord Of Light. The Many-Faced God is pretty exaggerated as gods go. The faces have some magical properties, but the work of the Faceless Men seems entirely earthbound. There\u2019s nothing celestial about contract killing. But we know the Lord Of Light is capable of some mighty deeds, or at least the rituals invoking him are. So there\u2019s room for discussing what happens when the Lord Of Light comes into conflict with Dany. What happens when she agrees with Tyrion that enough non-believers have been purified? And why is Varys so skeptical of Kinvara? He knows how to be obsequious better than anyone, but he\u2019s putting his foot down here? The suggestion, which lingers thanks to the cut away from Meereen, is that he might not serve Dany. Which immediately strikes me as absurd\u2014more smoke and mirrors playing at intrigue, another incomprehensible Littlefinger long run. But I guess time will tell. For all its puffed-up hints and evasions, \u201cThe Door\u201d is surprisingly forthcoming on the macro scale. We find out how the first Faceless Men arose out of the mines of Valyria to found the Free City Of Braavos, the faces they wore in life now lining the hall in the House Of Black And White. We get front-row tickets to the whole Drowned God thing, which we\u2019ve seen, but never in such detail. The ritual entails actually drowning Ironborn. Euron\u2019s lungs take in some salt water right in front of us, and if he\u2019s anointed king, he\u2019ll survive. Nobody even tries to resuscitate him. He has to awaken and spit up on his own, and lucky for him, he does.  (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)And then there\u2019s Bran, who rushes through his final lessons before an army of White Walkers destroys the school. First he discovers that the Children Of The Forest created the White Walkers in a ritual sacrifice involving strapping men to trees (the ones that now have faces that bleed tears in godswoods) and driving a blade into their chests. The White Walkers were meant to be a defense against humans, whose deforestation endangered the Children. Here Bran might have learned\u2014it\u2019s hard to tell what sinks in\u2014a central lesson of the show. There is no such thing as serving good. Whether you\u2019re a fire priestess or a Faceless Man or a loyal knight, you\u2019re serving a person. And people aren\u2019t pure. So queens make bad decisions, hands reinstitute slavery, monks of the Many-Faced God murder for faces, servants of the Lord Of Light burn children, Children Of The Forest sacrifice men. Whatever Bran\u2019s role is as the new Three-Eyed Raven, it won\u2019t be in service of some generic force for good. That doesn\u2019t exist. He can only try to do the right thing as he sees it.The climax of \u201cThe Door\u201d begins with Bran wandering through an army of wights who stand motionless. When Bran gets to the back, the Night\u2019s King turns and looks at him, directs the wights to look at him, too, and then grabs Bran\u2019s arm. Luckily Bran\u2019s allies wake him up, but Bran has a scar on his arm now, the mark of the Night\u2019s King, and apparently it allows the Walkers to enter the tree cave. Just go with it. It means the end of the tree cave and some exciting action. Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven are in the past when the Walkers attack, leaving Meera and the Children to defend them.  (Photo: HBO)Hodor is sitting there scared, as usual, unable to attack without Bran warging into him. It\u2019s one wild moment after another: The Children fire-bombing a defensive perimeter, the Walkers chilling the fire as they walk past (the wights remain trapped on the other side for the moment), Meera joining Sam and Jon on the list of people who have vanquished a White Walker, the Raven dying in the present and transforming into a smoke of ashes in Bran\u2019s vision, and Bran inexplicably fixated on Wylis in the past while his body lies prone in the present. One by one Bran\u2019s allies die defending him: the Raven, Summer, Leaf, and ultimately Hodor. It\u2019s just hectic enough to keep us guessing\u2014for example, is Bran gonna wind up stuck in Hodor\u2019s body?\u2014so that we\u2019re not totally prepared for its drama. (Photo: HBO)Bran never resurfaces. He\u2019s watching Wylis in the past, even though he can hear Meera shouting for him to warg into Hodor. Finally he does, and Hodor gets up and starts kicking wight ass. Suddenly, in the past, Wylis has his first \u201cepileptic fit.\u201d In the present Meera drags Bran on a sled off into the night, and Hodor holds the door to the cave shut from the outside. Meera shouts, \u201cHold the door!\u201d and in the past Wylis starts crying, \u201cHold the door,\u201d which eventually becomes \u201cHodor!\u201d The episode closes on Hodor, the most faithful servant, being torn apart by Romero zombies as Wylis cries, \u201cHodor! Hodor!\u201d for the first time. It\u2019s a heartfelt goodbye to a character who\u2019s been around from the beginning, and it\u2019s an all-bets-are-off demonstration of Bran\u2019s power. It\u2019s not completely clear what\u2019s happening, but Bran is apparently capable of splitting his consciousness. That is, he can \u201cman\u201d Hodor\u2019s body while staying fully aware of himself in his vision of the past. What\u2019s more, he can affect the past while he\u2019s in it! He isn\u2019t just a silent witness. Maybe Ned did hear his son calling outside the Tower Of Joy. What else might Bran be able to go back in time and \u201cfix?\u201d Or maybe he can\u2019t change the past, because all that\u2019s happened has happened despite his interventions from the future, such as Hodor being the man he is. In any event, Bran made an independent man the perfect lifelong servant by hijacking his body while time-traveling. Chosen ones, am I right? ", "episode_5": "\nThe follow-up to \u201cThe Door\u201d was always going to have the built-in challenge of having to be good not only on its own but also next to \u201cThe Door.\u201d And \u201cBlood Of My Blood\u201d doesn\u2019t have the benefit of many exciting surprises or turning points. In fact it puffs up a highly anticipated conflict before farting it away in a purposeful anticlimax. Meanwhile the visit to the Tarly ancestral home ends in Sam asking for a do-over on the dumbest idea he\u2019s ever had, and the visits with Bran and Dany are short, sweet, and light on information. But the problem isn\u2019t that \u201cBlood Of My Blood\u201d is more invested in intrigue than immediacy. It\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t have a very firm grip on its characters.What is Margaery thinking? Last we saw Loras, she\u2019s holding him, urging him to stay strong. Now she\u2019s brainwashed to the point she openly acknowledges the selfishness of her charity and urges her husband to formally join the High Sparrow. You might think, based on, for example, everything Margaery has ever done on this show, that she\u2019s manipulating Tommen. Perhaps this is part of the Tyrell-Lannister plot to rescue her. And why wouldn\u2019t she be informed of it somehow? What better way to bolster her resolve? On the other hand, like I said, there\u2019s no reason for them or us to think her resolve needs bolstering. Well, it turns out she wasn\u2019t in on it after all. When the day of atonement comes, she\u2019s surprised to see her grandmother fanning herself alongside Jaime with the Tyrell troops. So Margaery\u2019s either genuinely pious now, which is awfully sudden characterization no matter how many heartfelt speeches you give Jonathan Pryce. Or she\u2019s sold out her husband to free herself and left her brother to rot, which I don\u2019t buy for a second. And since we don\u2019t see her after the standoff, we don\u2019t get to find out. Either way, for Margaery, \u201cBlood Of My Blood\u201d is a non sequitur. It doesn\u2019t follow. And everything that happens in King\u2019s Landing in \u201cBlood Of My Blood\u201d is resting on her character.There\u2019s a moment where it looks like, at last, the High Sparrow reveals a chink in his armor. Jaime rides up the steps. The troops aim their weapons. And the High Sparrow stands up to Jaime. \u201cTo die in the service of the gods\u2026we yearn for it.\u201d That\u2019s the armor, not the chink. Martyrdom. It\u2019s unwinnable for Jaime, because even if the Sparrow dies, the Sparrow wins. It\u2019s the kind of thing you\u2019d expect the Sparrow to say and to believe. But then: \u201cBut there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.\u201d And for a moment this man has some shading. He doesn\u2019t want to die after all. He can try to save face, but he\u2019s intimidated by the prospect of death. Which doesn\u2019t reflect well on his faith in the common people he preaches to, either. But that\u2019s not why he calls off the walk. He had already called it off, because King Tommen and the High Sparrow have made some kind of alliance. Mace Tyrell speaks for me: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Olenna replies, \u201cHe\u2019s beaten us. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d There will be no dimension to the High Sparrow today. Even with Margaery gone dead-eyed and the Sparrow all supervillain, it\u2019s a powerful plot point, but it doesn\u2019t play nearly as powerfully as it should. The Sparrow didn\u2019t just beat the Tyrell-Lannister alliance at chess. He\u2019s the left hand of the King now. Everything he\u2019s done has been legitimized, and he seems to have carte blanche going forward. And he\u2019s too smart to throw it away. Meanwhile there\u2019s an intimate angle here that should play with our emotions. No, not Loras. Nobody spares a thought for poor Loras. It\u2019s that Tommen has to punish his uncle-father for daring to march on the sept. So he fires Jaime from the kingsguard and sends him away from the city. And before Jaime has a moment to process that, we hear Walder Frey\u2019s whine. There\u2019s a method to the mad editing here. Walder Frey is just a brief interruption of the King\u2019s Landing fallout, and his scene is set-up for Jaime\u2019s plot. But the cut to the Twins and back squanders the power of Tommen ruling against Jaime. (Credit where it\u2019s due: Lena Headey and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau make the most of the emotional climax of the King\u2019s Landing subplot, although they embrace with such force that they\u2019re almost off-screen.)The Tarly family visit is similarly unenlightening, but Sam gets a Valyrian steel sword in the process, so it\u2019s not a complete waste of time. It starts with Sam telling Gilly about his father banishing him to the Night\u2019s Watch and disinheriting him simply because Sam\u2019s not manly enough. \u201cA person just doesn\u2019t feel welcome at that point,\u201d Sam says. Later he adds, \u201cMy father doesn\u2019t like wildlings.\u201d So we\u2019re not the only ones who think this is a dumb, unmotivated idea. Sam himself agrees. But the decision\u2019s been made, and until Lord Tarly shows up, things are pretty good. It\u2019s a surprise to discover that Sam\u2019s mother and sister are so affectionate. When Lady Tarly grabs the girls and walks out of her husband\u2019s diatribe, it\u2019s a massive relief. Even though that castle is bigger than whole cities and Gilly\u2019s all alone in it with her baby, it looks like Gilly might have some degree of protection. She might be okay there after all. Lord Tarly, though, is nothing more than an avatar of daddy issues not seen since Lost. Even Tywin Lannister thinks Tarly needs to take it easy. The plotting is schematic, too, but it hits all its marks. What better time for Hannah Murray to capitalize on years of building audience sympathy? Gilly stands up for her man, she and Sam make peace with their parting, and at the last moment, Sam rushes back in to take his family with him to Oldtown. His new family, that is. On his way out, he steals Heartsbane, the Valyrian steel sword that he ought to have inherited anyway. Gilly asks what he\u2019ll do if Lord Tarly comes after him for it, and Sam gets this great hero moment, the camera looking up at him as he says, \u201cHe can bloody well try.\u201d (But I think it\u2019s a valid question.)Bran\u2019s family reunion goes much better for him and somewhat better for us. It starts with a moving \u201call is lost\u201d moment, when Meera loses her momentum and crumples in tears next to a sled containing Bran\u2019s unresponsive body. She\u2019s all alone. The wights are on her tail. And she just can\u2019t take it. Even when Bran finally returns, he has nothing to offer but bad news: \u201cMeera, they found us.\u201d In swoops Strider, er, a hooded horseman who handily takes care of the wights and spirits Bran and Meera away to somewhere. It turns out to be Benjen Stark. Since last we saw him, he was impaled by the White Walkers, was rescued by the Children, and made friends with the Three-Eyed Raven. Before anyone can ask for details, like why he never returned to the Wall or why he hasn\u2019t been at the tree cave, he tells Bran some more unhelpful mumbo jumbo. He says Bran has to control his power but offers no guidance in that arena. He says the Walkers will find \u201cthe world of men,\u201d and that Bran will be there waiting for them, which, again, unhelpful. Give us some details. In general this guy who\u2019s seen some things is not very forthcoming, which makes him just like all the other men with knowledge in Bran\u2019s life. No wonder Bran\u2019s drowning in magic.The best return of the episode is Needle. Arya finally reaches her point of no return, and she makes the only choice that makes sense. She\u2019s not ready to become a Faceless Man, she knows it, and she rejects that life in a thrilling surprise. It\u2019s a surprise because she does poison Lady Crane\u2019s drink. But Lady Crane, dressed like Cersei, catches her backstage and asks her about the play. The conversation tantalizes by reaching in all kinds of directions. She asks if Arya likes playing different characters. Arya suggests she can change the script, which is a history. And there\u2019s an electric parallel here to the original purple wedding: poison in the drink. Eventually Lady Crane asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Arya answers, \u201cMercy.\u201d Soon afterward Mercy\u2019s out the door. So we stick with the actors in their dressing room, Lady Crane suggesting she could change the writing and Richard E. Grant\u2019s character not taking the suggestion well. All the while she flirts with taking a sip of the poisoned drink. When she finally goes in for the kill, Arya suddenly reappears, knocking the glass from her hands. \u201cCareful of that one,\u201d she tells her, pointing at the younger actress. \u201cShe wants you dead.\u201d Arya hasn\u2019t just rejected the Faceless Men. She\u2019s on the run now. Jaqen promised, in not so many words, but not so few either, that either Lady Crane\u2019s face or Arya\u2019s would get mounted in the hall. When the Waif reports Arya\u2019s betrayal to Jaqen, he gives her permission to kill Arya. Which is what it feels like we\u2019ve been watching the past two seasons anyway, but now the gloves are really off. Meanwhile Arya recovers Needle and holes up in some hideout. A trained assassin is coming to kill her, but this is the biggest relief in the Arya storyline since she left the Hound. She\u2019s free. Talk about changing your script.", "episode_4": "\nWelcome to another season of Game Of Thrones reviews for those who have not read the books the series is based on. Since critics won\u2019t be receiving screeners this season, each week I\u2019ll publish the episode page once the broadcast ends and add my review to the page when I finish. That way newbies have a spoiler-free place to discuss the episode as soon as possible. As such, spoilers are strictly forbidden. Any spoilers in comments will be deleted on sight. Remember: Discussions of things that were different in the books or confirmations of things that won\u2019t happen count as spoilers, too. Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.Game Of Thrones has a crude way of making optimism unsettling. It\u2019d be one thing if Arya simply looked at the titans of Braavos on her last night in town. It\u2019s another when she\u2019s fresh off a triumphant moment, gazing with nostalgia as the happy music plays, and an old woman from It Follows calls her a sweet girl. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not so disturbing to watch Sansa secretly send a raven to someone who is probably Littlefinger asking for military support. It plays like it might turn out to be a very bad decision, but adversity just makes Team Stark underdogs. The most direct cause of the Red Wedding had no warning signs. Robb marrying Talisa was practically a honeymoon at Rivendell. What you really have to worry about are the unguarded happy endings, lest they turn out to actually be endings. Just ask Trystane and Myrcella.  (Photo: HBO)With that in mind, \u201cThe Broken Man\u201d opens on a merry construction site. People working together to build something? Ian McShane slapping backs and cracking jokes? Others cooking to sustain the camp? Uh-uh. Something\u2019s not right. Sure enough, by the end of the episode, Septon Swearengen and his merry men are dead, their tower unfinished. The first sight of the episode is that of a blacksmith forming a nail, one small step toward completing the tower. The last is The Hound grabbing an ax and walking off to kill some people. Naturally, an episode about people trying to build armies bends from creation to destruction. The Hound was reborn to go on fighting.It\u2019s been a season of surprise returns, and they still get me. The Hound is re-introduced in a rare cold open, because Rory McCann is back in the opening credits, right ahead of Maisie Williams. Apparently he looked like he\u2019d been dead for days when the septon found him. He coughed just in time not to be buried, which sounds a lot like Jon Snow to me, only this resurrection took no apparent magic. Just the more New Age magic of The Hound still having a purpose. (That said, with the Brotherhood in the region, I suppose it\u2019s possible some red priest showed up before the septon.) In the grand scheme, it sounds awfully arbitrary. What, Ned did more good by dying? But on a personal level, there\u2019s a lot of power here. The Hound has a second chance. It\u2019s hard to imagine this non-denom frontier town actually mattering to the show in the long run, and it\u2019s harder to imagine the Hound retiring there. But the character ostensibly has a choice.  (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)Septon Swearengen\u2014and seriously, is this production so harried that it consistently can\u2019t bother to name characters?\u2014asks, \u201cWhat kept you going?\u201d The Hound answers, \u201chate.\u201d He always sounds like an unrepentant bastard, but McCann and the writers give him much more dimension. He likes to seem like a formidable warrior, and he is one. But we\u2019ve seen him scared in Sansa\u2019s chambers and avuncular with Arya and now genuinely helpful doing mission work. Great sense of humor, too. The Hound definitely has one of the best dating profiles in Westeros.Septon Swearengen has an origin story somewhat like the High Sparrow. But where the High Sparrow is a rich kid bored by luxury, the septon was a proverbial good soldier who found a conscience, which somewhat resonates with The Hound\u2019s story. Now the High Sparrow\u2019s a fundamentalist seizing power in the capital, and the septon runs a New Age feel-goodery. The High Sparrow practices in the old sept and the septon at the site of a new one. They have similar messages of redemption, but the Sparrow sees atonement through strict personal suffering, while the septon sees atonement through good works.  (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)That divide informs Theon\u2019s crisis. He\u2019s understandably moody. His sister makes light of his castration and chalks his successive hostage experiences as a few bad years. Maybe if someone would drop the bluff and be real with him, acknowledge his terrible life and his terrible actions, he could start to get back to normal. As it is, he has to be the strict one in his life. It\u2019s almost comic when he interrupts Yara\u2019s pep talk with more self-pity: \u201cIf I got justice my burned body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.\u201d She\u2019s just as quick to cut him off. \u201cFuck justice, then. We\u2019ll get revenge.\u201d She needs the old Theon back. And as the septon tells the Hound, \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to come back.\u201d There\u2019s no redemption in killing yourself. But maybe he can start to make up for his crimes by helping others, in this case a would-be queen who\u2019s in it more for herself than for all the people Euron plans to slaughter, but still. And actually that\u2019s two would-be queens, as Yara plans to ally with Dany before Euron, which might just come to pass given the season so far. Apparently Yara\u2019s into women, as well, so I\u2019m definitely not wondering if Dany might be into a more revolutionary marriage than the one with fuckin\u2019 Hizdahr. Definitely not.Yara says, \u201cI\u2019m tired of watching you cower.\u201d As good as Alfie Allen is with the twitches and fidgets, I am, too. Game Of Thrones has a respectable but frustrating commitment to striking while the iron is hot and then sidelining its breakouts. Allen was a star after season two, but he\u2019s spent all his time since playing a brain-washed torture victim. Peter Dinklage gets a season of gracefully running King\u2019s Landing before he\u2019s demoted and then imprisoned. Brienne and Jaime spend just a season together before circumstance divides them. I haven\u2019t even mentioned the seemingly major characters who only get to spend a season alive. I admire the rigor. The writers make the most of Tyrion while he\u2019s in charge, because nothing lasts long in this world. But the casting is the best part of this show. The number one reason to watch isn\u2019t the complicated soap opera story or the lavish production design or the magical spectacles. It\u2019s to see Lena Headey\u2019s drunken tirades and Natalie Dormer smiling through everything and Alfie Allen feeling forced between a rock and a hard place. It\u2019s time to let him off the leash.Speaking of Margaery, she finally has a chance to let on that she\u2019s not so brain-washed. Which makes a lot more sense than the other option, but I\u2019m still skeptical of some of the characterizations involved in the foiled rescue attempt. Nobody on the outside was in communication with Margaery and none of them even knew about Tommen? In the presence of the sparrows, Margaery reiterates that Loras\u2019 only hope is to atone. But, looking away from the monitoring septa, Margaery\u2019s eyes bulge to impress on her grandmother that this is the real Margaery talking now, and she tells Olenna to get the heck out of dodge while slipping her a note. Well, a symbol: A sketch of a Tyrell rose. I\u2019m not sure what to make of it, beyond the immediate excitement of these two making real contact again. Before this scene, Margaery\u2019s playing the good penitent, reading scripture at the old sept of her own free will. Is she just trying to get information? The High Sparrow not so subtly threatens Lady Olenna, hence Margaery\u2019s insistence that her grandmother leave town.  (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)But are they really okay with cutting Loras loose? If so, that means Margaery held her brother at his lowest and decided to abandon him. If he repents, he\u2019ll have to be stripped of his titles, which leaves Highgarden without an heir. Surely Margaery and Olenna plan to prevent that. But how? They had an army at the walls of the sept once before and did nothing. Olenna won\u2019t even admit to Cersei that they ought to work together. Olenna\u2019s in full retreat mode. \u201cOur two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity\u2026 You\u2019ve lost, Cersei. That\u2019s the only joy I can find in this misery.\u201d So if Margaery and Olenna are such skilled players, how is this a win? I\u2019m very curious to look back at this story once the season is over.\u201cThe Broken Man\u201d isn\u2019t structured the usual way, with 10 minutes at King\u2019s Landing, then 10 at the Wall, and so on. Most of the plots are threaded throughout the episode, the ideas from one scene bearing on another. As Olenna refuses to fight Cersei\u2019s war, Lord Glover refuse to fight Jon\u2019s. Olenna, Glover, Cersei, Jon, the wildlings\u2014all of them are grappling with the questions of whether they can fight for their cause and where they belong. Even the property dispute at Riverrun is about that. Jaime\u2019s conversation with the Blackfish would have been quippier in earlier seasons, and it would have ended with a line about power. How can Riverrun be Frey property if the Tullys are living there as they always have? This version\u2019s less distinct, but it gets the job done. The Blackfish tells Jaime, \u201cAs long as I\u2019m standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle, and I\u2019m ready to die in it.\u201d Olenna\u2019s not ready to die in King\u2019s Landing, but Cersei doesn\u2019t belong anywhere but King\u2019s Landing. Hard to imagine we ever saw her in the North. (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)The Winterfell attack is about putting down the Boltons and restoring order, but it sounds to Northern lords\u2014many of whom lost loved ones in Robb\u2019s rebellion\u2014like Jon wants his house back. As they see it, Jon isn\u2019t a Stark, Sansa isn\u2019t a Stark, Davos isn\u2019t a Stark. It reminds me of Xaro interrogating Dany\u2019s entitlement in Qarth. The good guys may not have quite as compelling a claim as they thought. Eons of loyalty and tradition need to be sustained. Oaths eventually but up against imperatives like \u201cwe have no soldiers left to spare\u201d and \u201cthe Boltons saved us from the Ironborn.\u201d The way Jon puts it, even Rickon being held hostage by Ramsay doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal. The Starks held Theon hostage, after all. This is just the way things are done. Leave it to an episode anchored by commoners to finally convey a sense of the new world order. The new lords Bolton, Umber, and Karstark and the new lady Mormont are children. They don\u2019t yet appreciate the long histories of their houses, and they\u2019ve been saddled with the immediate tasks of rebuilding. Jon leans on honor to rally the troops, and Sansa leans on authority, but Davos gets the practicalities that would appeal to the new generation. He also has some experience making friends with girls. He\u2019s the one who impresses on Lady Lyanna Mormont just what a big deal this is. The true war, as he\u2019s fond of saying, is between the living and the dead. That\u2019s how you amass an army. Cersei\u2019s fighting for herself. If Olenna\u2019s fighting, it\u2019s for herself and her family. Yara\u2019s fighting for herself and what she thinks of as the good of her kingdom. Davos and Jon are fighting for survival.", "episode_56": "\n(This Game Of Thrones post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

But \"The Wolf and The Lion,\" the show's fifth episode, really reminded me of The Wire. Because just like with that show, I've been watching this thing for a month and enjoying it just fine, but it's this episode that jolted me into realizing just how invested I am. It's that point where you stop trying to figure out every character's relationship to each other, as you realize you've finally absorbed all that information through gradual osmosis. And, of course, it was a point at which all of the scheming and conversing and table-setting began to lumber forward and gain some real momentum. Swords were drawn! Blood was spilled! Six-year-olds were breastfed!\nThe defining moment of the episode, for me, was not the terrifically-done conversation between King Robert and his wife, nor the exciting action scenes (Tyrion taking out one of Catelyn's attackers and the cliffhanger battle between Jaime and Ned) but simply the fact that Ned quit as the Hand of the King about four episodes into him assuming the role. Now, I'm not saying that this is a permanent break-up (I know as little about what's to come as the rest of you noobs) but I was worried this show was going to end up saving all the action for its closing episodes. But here, already, we have Tyrion as Catelyn's prisoner and Ned facing doom at Jaime's hand; Robert is looking to assassinate Daenerys and his enemies are looking to move their plot in motion, and so on, and so forth. I didn't think the news about Daenerys would reach Robert's ears so soon, nor did I think Ned's principled nature would clash up against Robert's more muddied kinghood so quickly. I'm glad to be proven wrong.\nThe focus here was a little less sprawling, too. While other episodes have always jumped back to the Wall and across the Narrow Sea to keep us updated on Jon Snow and the Targaryen family, this time almost all the action was in King's Landing and the new location of The Eyrie, a big fortress governed by the nutty Queen Lysa Arryn, wife of the murdered former Hand of the King and sister to Catelyn Stark. There were some conversational interludes giving us some more backstory, like Theon and Bran in Winterfell or Robert's brother Renly's relationship with a foppish knight called Loras. But mostly we were following Ned as he kept hunting for clues to Arryn's murder, and Catelyn as she attempted to deal with Tyrion and her sister.\nLet's start with Ned, who had a lot of shit on his plate before he got stabbed in the goddamn leg at the end of the episode (at least, it looked like it was his leg). He now knows that Arryn was poisoned and that before his death that he had been investigating Robert's bastard children, possibly because he wanted to keep the Lannisters off the throne. He also thinks that maybe people are conspiring to kill Robert, but that's mainly based off the testimony of his youngest daughter. And at the same time he's trying to stop the ranting king from killing Daenerys in cold blood because she's pregnant. That big confrontation was well-played, especially in that the audience (or, at least, I) understands that Robert has a point. As dishonorable as such an action might be, it's tougher to be a king when there's real pretenders to the throne running around that someone could plonk a crown on. Ned's idealism is inherent, and his cred is backed up by his rugged homeland, but what's Robert supposed to do with that? It also seems to me that if you want to not have the Dothraki attack you, then you probably shouldn't murder their new queen. But that's just me.\nAt the same time that we understand Robert's position, our sympathies are obviously with Ned and his daughters, especially Arya, who grows more awesome each episode. So I'll admit to being fairly alarmed at his decision to postpone fleeing King's Landing to investigate one last thread of the Arryn mystery, particularly since it was at Petyr's behest. I get that there's something inherently trustworthy about such a scoundrel, but it's not great when your only ally in the city is basically a slimy, sneery pimp who's obviously no use in battle. As demonstrated by Petyr being absolutely nowhere when Ned and his guys (including Jory, who took a knife to the eye and I think is gone for good) get taken down by Jaime's guard. I had a feeling Ned wouldn't get out of King's Landing that easily. But I did not think shit would go down between the Starks and the Lannisters this quickly, either.\nCatelyn is the main cause of all this trouble, of course, and she probably shouldn't have taken Tyrion as a prisoner considering the evidence against him is a pretty obvious frame-up, as he notes. But plot-wise, it's a beautiful thing, because they make quite a bickering pair and Tyrion's brutal little hero moment with the shield was something to see. Apparently that was his first kill (nice to see they're not treating him like Yoda, or any other kind of small-statured kung fu genius) and Dinklage sold the moment well, just the right amount of adrenaline and disquiet at having to bash a dude's head open with the corner of a shield.\nI'm also happy Tyrion is on board to meet our new character, Queen Lysa (played by Kate Dickey, who I remember from crazy UK art movie Red Road). Lysa has pretty much the best introduction you could ever give a character -- she greets our heroes while breastfeeding her six-year-old child. That she'd be doing that at all is a little unusual, but that she'd be doing it while greeting her sister she hasn't seen in five years speaks wonderful volumes. Lysa's appearance was more of a tease for future episodes than anything else, but here's what I gleaned from it: she's crazy, her husband obviously wasn't around much, and that castle she's in is nigh-unbreachable. Game of Thrones has done very well so far in setting out the different kingdoms for us, and The Eyrie is another nicely unique one.\nActing-wise, the apex of the episode was definitely in that long, cards-on-the-table conversation Robert had with his doting wife Cersi (hah). Mark Addy has been a standout as the bored king so far but this was probably his most subtle moment so far, where he got to show a range of emotions rather than the usual pent-up frustration and bullying. Lena Heady, never one of my favorite actresses, had not made much of an impression as Cersi so far, mostly because the character is so ice-cool. But she did a decent job too, investing at least a modicum of empathy in character I should have absolutely no sympathy for. Cersi was part of a deal to unite the kingdom and ensure a Lannister would be on the throne eventually -- apparently, she lost their first child, at which point things went very cold in their marriage.\nSo even though we know what kind of horrible shit Cersi is up to, we understand it can't be fun to have a husband who mourns a lost love when he isn't having sex with whores, and have your entire existence justified essentially as a pregnancy vessel. In that way she's quite a good parallel to Daenerys, who was matched with Khal Drogo for the same reason but is asserting herself way better in that partnership. So I felt for her a little when she asked Robert if there was ever a way to make the marriage work, and he just said no.\nRobert also had quite a stunning monologue where he summarized his fears about a Dothraki invasion -- sure, he could hold them off from taking his castles, but then what right does he have to be king? It's something he probably isn't able to admit in front of his council or his war-buddies like Ned, but it also makes a hell of a lot of sense. At the same time, as he readily admits, the kingdom he's ruling is really more of a confederacy of schemers and backstabbers looking for their way into power -- not too many people really seem to serve at the pleasure of their king; rather, they serve at the pleasure of their lords, or their houses, or what have you. \"Your father wants to run the world, Ned Stark wants to bury his head in the snow...\" he tells Cersi. \"What do you want?\" she asks. He raises his glass of wine. It's something we had essentially gleaned over the course of the last four episodes, but somehow it doesn't feel like a violation of the old \"show, don't tell\" rule to have him give voice to his inner demons.\nSo!

This week reminded me of True Blood, hardly HBO's best, in a very specific way: With a closing scene that good, no matter what came before it, you just can't wait to see what happens next week.\nNot to say \"The Golden Crown\" was a bad episode. Far from it. But it felt like the last episode of plot-building and table-setting: The closing arc of the season is approaching and shit is obviously about to get real. And what, I ask you, is realer than Viserys Targaryen getting a pot of molten gold dumped on his head after he bleats to Khal Drogo that he wants his crown? Nothing, dear audience, is realer than that. He's the first casualty among our starring cast, and he may well not be the only one, but his demise was well-signaled once Daenerys started running shit in Dothraki-land.\nViserys was probably my least favorite character on the show, mostly because I didn't think Harry Lloyd rose to the challenge of playing him as a sneering villain very originally. Lloyd did a much better job once Viserys was down on his luck, however, and made quite an admirably pathetic figure here. In his speech to Jorah Mormont, we get a better idea of what makes him tick. He was basically told he would be king from childhood but has nothing to show for it, which is probably not the best way to raise somebody. \"The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was 5 years old, and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent,\" he says, referring to Daenerys' admittedly impressive feat of devouring a horse heart raw, which was wonderfully gross. The sight of her, covered in blood, proclaiming her son would be called Rhaego, was quite a striking image.\nKhal Drogo, a hulking monster of a man when the show started, had quite a bit of panache in this episode too. He dealt with Viserys' freakout not by just crushing his skull between his hands or what have you but actually through a bit of trickery. And he worked around the apparent rule that the Dothraki can't shed blood in their capital city, quite an onerous one, with the ingenious molten-gold thing. Daenerys is obviously still our focal point here, but she and Drogo appear to have a mutual understanding if nothing else. It's impressive that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (and, of course, George R. R. Martin) have made Daenerys' transformation from sobbing girl to confident queen seem so believable. Obviously, time is passing pretty quickly here, but we get that just from how the characters are moving forward: There's no \"three weeks later\u2026\" text or anything like that to help us along.\nThere was quite a bit of action over in the Eyrie as well, as we got the biggest taste of Tyrion's craftiness yet with his escape via trial by combat. Tyrion's plot is the catalyst for everything (Jaime fighting Ned, Cersei needling Robert, the Stark kids being taken back to Winterfell), and, thus, I like the sense that it's based on rash calls (arresting him was a spur-of-the-moment thing, as was taking him to Lysa Arryn) and is now really slipping away from Catelyn. Over in King's Landing, Ned insists that she was acting on his orders, but that's difficult to believe. At best, the two were only dimly aware of how entangled their dual investigations were. At this point, it appears that Catelyn has fully lost control of the situation, not accounting for Lysa's craziness, Tyrion's craftiness, or the fact that he's likely innocent of the crimes she accused him of.\nShe also appears to have lost her man Bronn, although I guess she just picked him up in a bar, so maybe he was never her man. Bronn steps up to fight for Tyrion in the trial by combat, facing one of Lysa's well-armored knights, and succeeds by doing what I decided was the closest thing to a street fight, dashing about, throwing shit on the floor, and generally scoring hits where he could get them. Lysa accuses him of not fighting with honor, and he retorts, \"No. He did,\" which is pretty pimpin'. Of course, it's not like Lysa's justice system, which seems to place a lot of decision-making in the hands of her wacko son, makes that much more sense.\nCome to think of it, I can hardly complain that this wasn't an action-packed episode: Along with the molten gold and the Eyrie duel, we also had the Game of Thrones version of a Mexican standoff after Bran, testing out his new saddle, is confronted with weirdo villagers or mountain people or something. He's rescued after a nice bit of swordsmanship by Robb and a luckily-fired arrow by Theon, but I liked how Theon kept his drawn bow trained on a woman's head, like it was a gun. The side-story of Winterfell and Bran's recovery has been the least-connected to the main plot so far, but I love the environment (especially those atmospheric woods) and Isaac Hempstead-Wright's performance, and I'm sure Bran is going to have quite a bit of bearing on the future. Those prophetic dreams with the three-eyed crow have to mean something.\nLet's wrap up with King's Landing, where Ned is quickly pardoned by Robert, then sits in for him on the throne and makes what seems like quite a proclamation (gathering an army of 100 to take down Ser Gregor the Mountain) on a couple of villagers' testimony. At the same time, he also figures out that Prince Joffrey must be a child of Lannister blood because he doesn't have black hair. It's not quite CSI, but it just about works since this world is so built on the tribalism of these houses and their shared features. What's slightly more baffling is how rash Ned has become. The way his fight with Jaime is dismissed by Robert makes sense because, as Robert says, his kingdom doesn't work if the Starks and Lannisters are fighting. But Ned quickly decides to withdraw Sansa from her arranged marriage to Joffrey and go up against Tywin Lannister's prized knight, all without consulting Robert, who's off hunting. Essentially he's giving up his biggest bargaining chip (the marriage) and at the same time, playing that chip in going after Gregor. Petyr doesn't seem disturbed enough.\nNed's decision regarding Sansa is obviously motivated by his feelings as a father, which trump his ability to scheme (unlike most people on this show). Sansa, unfortunately, remains bewitched by Joffrey's particular brand of creepy wooing and his promises of her happy Queendom. Arya is disgusted by the whole thing but likes that she's finally being taken seriously as a warrior; nonetheless, it's obvious she has more of a head on her shoulders than Sansa, who gets a solo scene of her being a whiny teenager to her lady-in-waiting. But with all that going on, plus Tyrion trumping Catelyn and Daenerys' rise to power over the sea, it's obvious shit is about to come to a head, which makes Ned's rashness extra worrying.\nAfter this week, there are no more screeners, so I'll be watching live with the rest of you newbie devils. Here's hoping for some seriously shocking shit.\n", "episode_54": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

If you see spoilers, please mark them as best you can and e-mail todd at vanderwerff dot us or contact Todd on Twitter at tvoti, and he'll take care of them as soon as possible.)\nI know I predicted last week that it'd all be kicking off in this episode, but even with that, shit got impressively real on Game of Thrones episode seven, \"You Win or You Die,\" as it became increasingly obvious that Cersei's title line (heavily used in the series' promotion) is going to be very true. I'm amazed at the situation Westeros is in with three episodes to go, i.e., the brink of civil war. I figured maybe we'd be getting to that point by the time the season came to a close. Instead, we get a truly shocking death this episode, both in how abruptly it happens and in how appropriately sad and pathtic it is.\nWell, maybe the latter part was a little less than shocking. Fare thee well, King Robert Baratheon: assuming your off-screen death is not some sort of ploy for you to return triumphant later on (which seems unlikely), you died as you lived in this show. Sure, we heard tell of his former glories but to us, just from the frequent look on Ned's face, it was obvious what a shadow of himself Robert had become, and in that way it made sense that he died rashly charging a boar during a hunt. But the way it was presented was a little jarring; Renly, covered in blood, approaches Ned after the hunt and then we cut to Robert in bed, dictating his will to Ned; after that, we're told he died off-screen. Given how things work on this show, you almost expect foul play, except then Robert would have been a witness to his own murder. I'm not ruling out the fact (there was talk of the wine he was given by Lancel Lannister), but I think we're to assume he's a victim of hubris even so.\nMark Addy did well in his final scene, too -- he's been a great presence for the show, even though Robert really only had two modes, drunk-angry and drunk-melancholy. His contrition before Ned was a well-earned moment, as he looked back on a reign that will surely be best-remembered for how he got the throne, not what he did when he had it. In retrospect, it's obvious that Robert had to die, since he was what was keeping everyone in line, be it through his marriage to Cersi, his friendship with Ned or his connection to the Arryns. Now that he's gone, Cersi is backing Joffrey on the throne as rightful ruler, while Ned seeks to install the unseen Stannis Baratheon, Robert's brother, who apparently has been gone this whole time (I assume he's been mentioned before, but this is the first time we really hear about him).\nIn a great scene near the start of the episodes, Ned confronts Cersei with what he knows, and she keeps that icy poker face on even as she cops to having all her children with Jaime (apparently keeping it in the family is considered preferable) and apparently basically never letting Robert have sex with her to completion, finishing him off in other ways instead, which is kinda nuts -- we're supposed to believe that he never noticed because he's always drunk. It certainly forgives his epic whoring a little bit. And yet, as Cersei admits to everything, we still feel an ounce of sympathy for a woman who was wed at a young age to a powerful conqueror who quickly proved himself a drunken sot in love with a dead woman. If this show has a straight-up villain now that Viserys is gone, it is Ceresi (who exudes constant menace) but she's not without depth.\nPlus, this week we finally meet her father, Tywin Lannister, played by Charles Dance, who meets and surpasses the considerable off-screen reputation the character has built up over the course of the show. Dance is a wonderful actor, but he's often cast as mean old dudes where old is the key word. But Tywin, who dresses down Jaime while gutting and skinning a deer in his one scene, is wiry and tough and coldly terrifying. Jaime, obsessed with his public image, is obviously cowed by the man; Cersi obviously takes after his chilly pragmatism; Tyrion, we assume, deals with this mean bastard with his own mean sense of humor, which I'm sure goes over just splendidly. In this one scene, we see where the whole Lannister mojo comes from and how it's split over his three kids, and it's really one of the best scenes of the show so far.\nI have less praise for Petyr's bit of character-development, which is delivered well by Aidan Gillen...as he watches two prostitutes pleasure each other (they are in whorehouse training, and one of them is Ros, the girl from Winterfell). It's like they're afraid we won't be interested in what makes Petyr tick if he doesn't tell us while simultaneously showing a girl how to finger-bang another girl. I understand the loose connection to what he's talking about (his love for Catelyn, his anger at her treating his love as boyish infatuation) and where it leads us to (him \"fucking people,\" i.e. drawing a knife on Ned in the cliffhanger) but it's still pretty hilarious to see him say that he's been in love for many years, and then slip in, \"Play with her arse.\"\nPetyr's ultimate betrayal of Ned is well-telegraphed. I don't think he would have done it had Ned gone along with his plan to control Joffrey as regent and sort out who's the rightful heir later. Ned is horrified at his lack of honor, which is all we expect of our protagonist, and yet by now, we know Petyr has a point -- when you're dealing with entirely dishonorable people, honor is a hindrance, not an asset. The audience is on Ned's side for the whole episode, and his one bit of deceit (writing \"my rightful heir\" instead of \"Joffrey\" in Robert's will) shows how clever he can be. Plus, our sympathies are hardly with Joffrey, evil little shit that he is, nor Cersei.\nBut it's to the show's credit that Ned's path is hardly one of simple heroism. Catelyn's decision to arrest Tyrion (who is sadly offscreen this week) was a foolish one, and her taking him to the Eryie was even dumber. Not telling Robert what he had discovered was probably an error too, even though it would have been piling on the man while he laid dying. But Robert's last orders, given alive, could probably have made some impact. Once he's dead, they're worth the paper they're printed on, as Cersei demonstrates to the horror of Ned, Barristan (who obviously still has a shred of honor) and absolutely no one else. But Ned's worst decision in my eyes was to keep is kids in King's Landing when he had multiple opportunities to get them away, but kept getting distracted by Petyr's trail of breadcrumbs. Arya and Sansa were not seen this week, but god knows what's in store for them next week.\nOf course, the most intriguing thing about this brewing civil war is that none of the lords know, or could hope to predict, the hell coming for them from Khal Drogo and the Dothraki, who is provoked only by the somewhat ridiculous assassination attempt on Daenerys. Seriously, who would have thought she'd be charmed by that wine salesman in that market? Or did Jorah, who obviously has been working as a double-agent, lead her there? Either way, it seems Jorah has picked a side for good, either because he knows a winner when he sees one or because he's in love with Daenerys as Viserys hinted last week. Before the poisoned wine, Drogo was obviously looking forward to a nice, quiet marriage to Daenerys, but now, in typically over-the-top fashion, he's promising pillaging and rape and plunder and all the rest of it for Westeros. Unlike most of the developments on this show, which have been enjoyably surprising twists, I think we all saw this coming from day one.\nAnd not only is there the danger from across the sea, but there's the danger from across the wall, as hinted by both the wildling prisoner and the severed hand Jon's direwolf picks up while Jon is being sworn in as a member of the black watch. Jon's story was probably the least interesting this week, because it felt like a rehash of weeks prior -- Jon's arrogance gets the better of him, his friends gently remind him to stop being so self-important, and he calms down. But I did like his exchange with Sam: \"I always wanted to be a ranger.\" \"Well, I always wanted to be a wizard!\"\nQuibbles aside, it's nice to see Game of Thrones rise to the challenge it set itself with all the characters, all the plot machinery and all the table-setting of the last six episodes. A lot of shows start out that way and don't know how to close -- but this doesn't seem like one of them. Here's to next week.\n", "episode_53": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

If you see spoilers, please mark them as best you can and e-mail todd at vanderwerff dot us or contact Todd on Twitter at tvoti, and he'll take care of them as soon as possible.)\nGame of Thrones' eighth episode (penned by George R.R. Martin) feels like the most zoomed-out the sprawling show's been so far, in a good way. Joffrey's on the throne, Ned's in the dungeons, Renly has fucked off somewhere, and everyone else is summoning their armies around them and marching to war. Sure, there's some off-screen fighting that we unfortunately only hear about through dialogue, but \"The Pointy End\" quite masterfully kept us abreast of everything going on, while sticking to the point-of-view style the show has held from the start. And even though we're back in table-setting territory a little bit (more than one scene had people pushing figurines around maps like a game of Risk), this episode also had a seriously hefty amount of awesome fight scenes (and a nice helping of Hodor penis, if that's what you're into).\nThe only thing I really noticed with Martin scripting is that this episode seemed to lack some of the very long conversations and monologues of weeks past. Whether that was a personal preference or just down to the fact that this was a very busy episode, I don't know, but it served the show well. The same amount of info was conveyed, but the pace was quicker, which suited. Plus, I think Martin has a taste for the unconventional when it comes to fight scenes. Syrio's face-off with the knights using only a wooden sword was beautiful to watch, and the moment the sword was cut down told us all we needed to know (his fate is left to our imaginations). Contrarily, when Drogo throws down with some dude who doesn't like Daenerys' sympathy for slave women, he kills him gorily, even for this show\u2014goes in through the throat, and rips out his tongue. Ouch.\nFor all the nasty twists like that, there was some affecting stuff in here too, especially concerning the poor Stark family, who really had a pretty bad week. Ned languishes in prison with only Varys to talk to, seemingly resigned to his fate now that Catelyn's lost Tyrion (the look on his face when he heard that news was painful). Catelyn's reunion with her son was very well-played, since now, he's a commander of a huge army, and she has to be careful not to mother him so much. But both actors sold that hug very well. Arya, of course, loses Syrio and escapes into the deep of the castle herself. And Sansa is probably the worst off, a prisoner in a gilded cage, trying to balance what might remain of Joffrey's affection with her attempts to save her father's life. She's such an innocent that I'm almost worried for her the most, even though she's hardly my favorite character. \"I won't hatch anything!\" she promises. She really deserves nothing that's coming to her. Hell, even Bran's little brother (have we seen him before?) seems more wised-up than her about the ways of the world.\nSansa does quite well in throwing herself at the mercy of her former (still current?) love Joffrey, who has become 10,000 times more of a shit now that he's on the throne. God, I will watch this show even if it goes on for a hundred seasons just if they promise me gruesome violence against that little kid. I have to give Jack Gleeson credit. I remember him being an adorable little tyke in Batman Begins. His pampered, evil little face brings me the most rage on this show. Another interesting fact to note: While Petyr and Varys cautiously advise their new lord to treat Sansa with grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has gone from being a kindly old monk to a sour-faced bastard who essentially thinks Sansa has TRAITOR BLOOD in her veins. I think this is supposed to signify that of all Ned's advisers, he was maybe the least trustworthy after all, piping info about Ned's doings to Cersei all along. Or maybe he's just a mean old man. Either way, quite the character shift.\nTyrion, on the other hand, remains himself as ever, but even more so. Last time we saw him, he'd talked one mercenary onto his side with promises of future glories. This week, he raises a whole army. An army of terrifying sub-Viking types called \"Shagga\" and the like, but an army nonetheless. Tyrion's silver-tongue scene where he stops this band of halfwits from killing him on sight is another great mix of comic relief and impressive smarts from Peter Dinklage, who was sorely missed in episode seven. As he reminds us so bluntly, \"I like living!\" His confrontation with his father plays even better. While Jaime obviously lives in fear of scary old Tywin, Tyrion is so used to scorn coming from the man, he's weirdly more at-ease. And Tywin seems\u2026 well, not impressed by the band of beardos his son has gathered, but not quite scornful either. That scene had a lot to take in, as Tywin brings Tyrion up to date on everything we know and a few things we don't (apparently, Jaime's off making war somewhere, and he's doing well, but we don't really get the details). But, like most of the infodump scenes, Martin mostly keeps us in the loop, and we're pretty confident anything we'll miss will get cleaned up for us later.\nUp in the north, I was happy to have some real action for a change, instead of a Jon sulk-a-thon. Things seemed to be heading in that direction with the bad news from King's Landing and Jon almost getting in another fight with his bullying trainer. But then\u2026 ZOMBIES! Zombies are a cure-all to pretty much any narrative stoppage. And Game of Thrones poses an interesting question with its zombies, although I don't know this is the point of it, but it occurred to me. How do you fight zombies\u2026 in a world with no shotguns? Jon tries to stab them, gets one of them through the heart, etc., but all that works is fire (we don't know if decapitation does the job yet). It's another great fight scene, nice and scary (although who didn't see that shit coming!) that broke up the drudgery that the Wall scenes had become. Hopefully, that continues in the weeks ahead, because I don't want to be watching Jon's bits and clamoring for them to back down south for war.\nAfter all, that's what Robb's doing, right? (Niiiiice segue, David). This week probably had the most character stuff for Robb since the show started, and about bloody time, since he's marching all the armies of the north against the Lannisters. Swaddled in a few extra layers of fur, he somehow seems a bit more grizzled (although he's still quite a pretty lad) before he has his wolf rip the fingers off of a lord who dares defy him. As I mentioned earlier, the show has a subtle nod to Robb's enduring boyhood when he was greeted by his mother, but he's a just-about compelling leader figure too, although I hope he has something up his sleeve when he releases the Lannister spy, because on its own that did not seem to be the smartest move.\nAs the armies march, Martin inserts a natural plot obstacle (that I'm sure he used in the books too) in case we thought all the fighting would go down in episode nine. Apparently Robb has to convince some cranky old dude in some tower to let him go through, or else there won't be any war. Game of Thrones has had a surprisingly rapid-moving plot as we come to these final episodes, but it's not above such tactics. I'm looking forward to seeing which English character actor gets swaddled in a beard to play this dude!\nSimilarly, the Dothraki march to war appears slower than I originally predicted, as Daenerys objects to their tribal practices of enslavement and rape (the whole \"savages\" part of this plot has always made me a little uncomfortable) and Drogo has to fight some underling to back her up. Then he gets wounded, and some witch lady offers to help\u2026 I don't know, guys. Suddenly I'm not as convinced we're going to see Dothraki war along with the North vs. South war we're already being treated to. I mean, if they're fighting over shit like this, how are they ever going to get the nerve up to cross the sea? Still, they treated us to that tongue-ripping, and Drogo did some very handy fighting with no weapons at all. I suppose I should be satisfied.\nWith two episodes to go, the show seems to get more skilled week by week at dispensing information, blending it together with action, character wor,k and suspense, and really feeling like a TV show rather than a port of a novel. So, that's good. Let's give this one an A, and hope that they stick the landing.\n", "episode_33": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of      view  of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Remember: Discussions of     things   that were different in the books or confirmations of things     that\u00a0won\u2019t\u00a0happen count as spoilers, too. Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.\nAlright, dudes. It\u2019s time to get things moving. I know I\u2019m going to write this slightly frustrated, toe-tapping review this week and then next week something insane will happen\u2014Tywin will turn into a dragon and eat Joffrey, and Jon Snow will fight a thousand zombies on a mountaintop, and Arya and the Hound will get an awesome spinoff that\u2019s just a remake of Simon & Simon. And it\u2019s not like this episode was lacking in holy-shit moments. That closing scene, with Sam confronting the White Walker successfully this time, was astounding.\nBut still, this episode left me a little frustrated. I know that what we\u2019re seeing is the first half of the third book, and I\u2019m more and more afraid that there isn\u2019t going to be quite as devastating a closing punch as there was in the last two seasons, because we\u2019re going to be closing on the middle of a book. Ugh, I can feel myself eating my words as I type this, so I\u2019m just going to stop, because David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (and George R.R. Martin) know what the fuck they\u2019re doing, and they haven\u2019t let me down yet.\nPlus, hell, this episode had a lot of Stannis in it, and if you want to make David Sims happy, write an episode where Stannis doesn\u2019t just brood and look out onto the sea. Sure, he\u2019s always going to do a bit of that, but his reunion with Davos was played very nicely and gave us another glimpse into what\u2019s going on behind that sour visage.\nMelisandre has procured Gendry (who, by the way, she found and spirited back very easily\u2014further testament to her powers, or lazy storytelling?) and wants to use his blood for her dark rituals, saying it has power because Robert Baratheon is his father. Since Stannis\u2019 machinations are against the other false kings, there\u2019s a weird sense to her magic as ever, but Davos immediately guesses that Stannis is uncomfortable with the arrangement and wants his counselor to provide some contrary advice.\nSo Davos is out of jail, thankfully, and has even learned to read a little bit during his downtime. He\u2019s immediately back to hating on Melisandre and telling Stannis not to kill his own kin (offing Renly was okay because he had betrayed him, apparently). So we get a long, somewhat dull but nonetheless tense scene where Melisandre undresses and seduces Gendry, ties him to the bed, and leeches his blood, some sort of compromise aimed to bring down Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy (whom we haven\u2019t heard much of in quite a while), and Joffrey.\nWho knows whether it\u2019ll work, but as Stannis points out, she did give birth to a shadow assassin before Davos\u2019 eyes, and she has shown him crazy visions in the flames. It\u2019s tough for him not to believe, even though to our contemporary eyes he\u2019s a stereotypical fanatic, shaping facts to fit his desired truth and ignoring anything that contradicts it. I think I\u2019ve said this before, but I get it\u2014especially with the new revelation this year that the Lord of Light can bring people back from the dead, well, heck, I\u2019m a believer.\nWe finally got a wedding this week, the first of many that have been planned all season, and, well, it\u2019s a bit of a bummer from start to finish. Sansa remains terrified of Tyrion, but he\u2019s 10 times more terrified of her, refusing to bed her and getting so heroically drunk that he openly threatens to castrate the king in what is probably Tyrion\u2019s finest moment of this whole season. He\u2019s been a depressing character after running the show last year, and he\u2019s still a bummer to watch, but \u201cyou\u2019ll be fucking your bride with a wooden cock\u201d? I stood and I applauded.\nDo I buy Tyrion not doing his husband\u2019s duty with Sansa? Of course I do, even though this is a world where grown men are married to 14-year-olds without much objection. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s just being soft-pedaled because the viewing audience would be horrified at such a turn of events. Tyrion\u2019s been there for all of Sansa\u2019s mental torture and anguish at the hands of Joffrey; he knows the last thing he wants is to add to that.\nJoffrey keeps giving us new reasons to despise him, as if we needed more, and his behavior at the wedding with Tyrion and Sansa is a masterclass in utter villainy by Jack Gleeson, whom I don\u2019t give enough credit for just nailing that sniveling, preening fucker. He\u2019s so good it\u2019s scary, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll suffer the consequences for the rest of his acting career. I was less taken with Cersei\u2019s interaction with Margery, though. She seemed to be tipping her hand a bit too much\u2014if the story of the Lannisters wiping out a rival family wasn\u2019t enough, she said she\u2019d have her killed for calling her sister. Maybe we\u2019re supposed to think that Cersei doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing? Because that felt like an incredibly stupid move from a court intrigue angle.\nDaenerys\u2019 story took a turn that probably had to happen but will likely slow things down even further\u2014she got a love interest, someone her own age whom she isn\u2019t being sold to as part of a military alliance, and someone who I\u2019m sure will cause trouble in the weeks ahead. His name is Daario and he\u2019s played by Ed Skrein, and he\u2019s very handsome and has the \u201cI take what I want\u201d attitude that Daenerys finds so alluring.\nOn the one hand, that\u2019s fine. Daenerys\u2019 storyline had become very one-note: She goes to a city, she gets notes of caution from her advisers, she is a badass with dragons. A new character will help complicate things in a different way. On the other hand, it\u2019s going to be tough to watch Daenerys entangled in such an\u2026 ordinary mess. If such a mess is on the horizon! Their scene together with the bathtub just suggested sparks flying to me.\nThe most crucial, fascinating, electric moment of the night came from Sam and Gilly\u2019s final scene, something I hardly expected to be typing, but there you go. I didn\u2019t really expect that to be the end of Sam\u2019s story, chased down by a White Walker, but I still love that he got his hero moment after failing in the season opener. Plus, now we have a new weapon against those undead fuckers. We\u2019ve long known about burning them, but the ancient weapon Sam uncovered turns them into ice and SHATTERS them. If anything bodes well for next week (two weeks actually, because of Memorial Day), it\u2019s that.\n", "episode_51": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

This had been a great season, and the promise for season two and all the fighting was tremendous, but we were getting served an awful lot of shots of people going off somewhere. Arya and a bunch of rapscallions are going off to the wall. Tyrion and Shae are going off to King's Landing, Robb's lot are going off to war, and the black watch are going off into the north. It's all very exciting, but very dangly. And just as I was starting to get itchy, well, dragons. Yes, Daenerys ends the season the same way she began -- naked -- but this time she's got a trio of dragons crawling on her. One might say that's just as dangly a plot as the rest of them, but it brought a sense of everything coming full circle that was sorely needed, as well as leaving absolutely everyone salivating for season two. At least, I certainly am.\n\"Fire and Blood\" was a mostly satisfying romp, but if you're looking for loose ends to be tied up, this wasn't the show for you -- it's almost cavalier how much they know they're getting a second-season pickup. We essentially check in with everyone and see what direction they're facing in season two. Robb is looking pretty good as a newly-proclaimed King for the North; Joffrey, on the other hand, doesn't really seem to have a taste for the affairs of state, and King's Landing is crawling with usurper-types. As it was for most of the reason, we're still spared any large-scale battling; but season two, with the kingdom now fully at war, promises an even more epic scale, providing that HBO pony up the cash.\nLet's start with Daenerys, the only character to really have a whole arc this episode, as she woke to the news that her baby was dead and her husband was catatonic, but ended with a new army of followers and the promise of an invading force better than thousands of horsemen -- three sexy dragons. I'll admit that I was not quick to the take on all of her flame-retardant powers, but once Viserys got crowned, I began to get the idea that her talk of being the dragon was supposed to be more than just talk. Still, the eggs were teased at best through the season, making this cliffhanger a major surprise. Not quite as major as Ned's death, perhaps, but still pretty darn major.\nSince we're ending the season with many people claiming a right to the throne (including the unseen Stannis), let's imagine what kind of a Queen she'd be. Daenerys can get pretty scary (the witch Mirri's demise was not too nice) but there's noble intention to a lot of what she does, as her new tribe of freed slaves shows. I'm not sure if we're supposed to see her as a hero, though. As Mirri points out to her, there's not much worth in Daenerys saving her considering Drogo's men had already pillaged and raped her community to nothingness. And dragons, a symbol of scorched earth more than anything else, do not suggest her invasions would be any different. But since Daenerys is from a sort of bondage, being sold into marriage by her horrible brother, she has an empathy that none of the other would-be kings, all lordy types, possess.\nJoffrey, the lordliest of them all, is already proving to be the horrible brat he always was, except now he has the power to command death. His dealing with the singer who composed a nicely flowery fuck-you song about Cersei was wonderfully creepy. This court, as we're reminded, has already dealt with a king who's insane. Joffrey might not be crazy, but his whims seem to be along the lines of a kid who lights ants on fire, and he doesn't have a terrific way with women. His scene with Sansa (featuring the best work yet by Sophie Turner) was horrible stuff, not only for his behavior, but for how it dawns on poor Sansa that as the only Stark remaining in the castle, she's going to have to put on a brave face and submit to this horrible boy, as the Hound advises. Arya, bundled off with one of Robert's bastards and a bunch of idiots to go up north, is hardly in a good position, but it's enviable compared to Sansa, who will have to stand in court and watch the boy who killed her father on the throne.\nThe rest of the Lannisters are appropriately disgusted with the kid, though. Cersei, who has begun an affair with another flaxen-haired kid, the squire Lancel, looks mostly out to lunch. Tywin, with Tyrion advising him, admits that without Ned, they've lost their biggest bargaining chip and now have Robb, Stannis and Renly all breathing down his neck. And Jaime, well, he's got to be wondering if Robb will ever get mad enough to take out his frustration on his neck, rather than a tree.\nTywin's scene with Tyrion was wonderfully touching in a dry, funny sort of way. Tywin is now recognizing his son's usefulness, and he's insightful enough to realize that he's better in court than in the field. Tyrion's victory in battle, of course, was not that he led his men tactically -- it was that he got them on his side at all, when he was at their mercy. Dinklage plays the scene well, mixing in the right amount of sincere surprise at his father's words (\"You're my son\") along with the usual dry wit. Bringing Shae along may not be the best judgment call, but as we now know, Tyrion doesn't have the best judgment around women, particularly women of the night. But the idea of him as Hand of the King is honestly too perfect for words. While Ned the honorable soldier was everything wrong for the role, Tyrion the insightful schemer is perfect. Plus it'll give him a chance to slap Joffrey in the face repeatedly again, and god knows Joffrey needs a good slapping.\nRobb and Catelyn (and, even more briefly, Bran) didn't get much time for grieving before the separatist talk started up. The \"King in the North\" stuff makes perfect sense -- Winterfell has always been positioned as being close to its own country as it is, and Robb is cutting a rather dashing, warrior king figure. But what I liked most about these scenes (apart from Michelle Fairley doing a good job with the emoting) was that brief shot of the serfs and soldiers in the north's tents gazing on as Robb is being proclaimed king by his lords. Sure, as an audience, we're on their side, but that shot reminds us that he's not quite a hero of the people yet, and it's not like Westeros is close to seeing the founding of a republic. Maybe I'm reading too much into one brief shot, but Game of Thrones is very good at nicely undercutting any hero moment that might seem na\u00efve or one-sided, and this was a great example.\nAs for Renly and Stannis, I assume they'll be more in play next season, with Stannis an opportunity for the show to find another name actor to replace the dearly-departed Sean Bean. Hell, just cast Bean in the role -- that guy can be versatile if you let him! What's most exciting to me about season two is that, with civil war, and the Starks scattered around the country, and dragons, it promises to be an entirely different beast from the first season. Game of Thrones delivered on its promise of all its table-setting, its backstories and monologues and attention to detail. You could complain that the whole thing was a set-up for the tale of war, but with the focus on the Starks, and the decline of Robert and Ned and the rise of Daenerys and Robb (and others), the season told a complete story, and a very satisfying one.\n", "episode_50": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of  view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what's coming? That's what our experts reviews are for.)\nAround a year ago I started watching Game Of Thrones with a mix of casual interest and marked skepticism. I was wary that this was a show pre-built for fans of a series of books I\u2019d barely heard of, and that it\u2019d be impenetrable nonsense for the rest of us. Here we are at the start of season two, and although I was wrong (and happily ate my words), there was a glimmer of truth to that thought\u2014this is a show for fans. I don\u2019t think there are many casual watchers of Game Of Thrones. It\u2019s hard to be casual about a show with such an epic sweep to it, with such a deep roster of cast members. Keeping track of all the back-story and everyone\u2019s shifting alliances requires more than a casual level of attention.\nBut what makes Game Of Thrones such a success is how shockingly easy it is to become a fan. Like a lot of TV\u2019s best shows, it throws you into the deep end and expects you to pick out details to get yourself up to speed. But its characters are so instantly accessible\u2014the minute you see Arya, or Tyrion, or Cersei, you know what they\u2019re about\u2014that it\u2019s not hard to concentrate. That\u2019s important, because season two is clearly going to be just as packed with detail as season one, if not more. \u201cThe North Remembers\u201d whisks us from location to location, catching us up with the big ensemble and throwing a few new characters into the mix, and it expects viewers to be paying attention.\nIf the episode has a flaw, it\u2019s borne out of circumstance\u2014there\u2019s a lot of table-setting to be done, and this show is not going to be able to do it in one 50-minute episode. So while we check in at King\u2019s Landing, Winterfell, beyond The Wall, the Stark war camp, and out in the desert. We also meet new character Stannis Baratheon (Stephen Dillane) on the isle of Dragonstone. For the moment, there\u2019s no sign of Renly Baratheon or Tywin Lannister, two of the big players in the brewing war, which remains at the \u201cbrewing\u201d stage for now.\nBut still, it\u2019s remarkable how much gets packed in, and how much the show can get across in the brief time it spends with its many, many characters. As usual, I\u2019ll take things location by location.\nAll we see of Dragonstone is Stannis\u2019 big throne room (his castle is very castle-y) and a big dark beach where he and a crazy fire priestess, Melisandre (Carice Van Houten) set effigies of the gods on fire and pledge themselves to a newer, crazier-looking religion that seems to revolve around a flaming sword. It\u2019s quite an introduction, but even better is the following scene, where Stannis\u2019 maester (beautifully, briefly played by Oliver Ford Davies) dies at Melisandre\u2019s feet after attempting to poison her.\nOnce again, Game Of Thrones has excelled in the economy with which it introduces its new characters. Stannis comes off as prickly and cold, quibbling about the details of his press release proclaiming himself king (he refuses to call Robert his \u201cbeloved\u201d brother) and disinterested in an alliance with his popular brother Renly or the insurgent Starks. Melisandre, though, is clearly no ordinary svengali. That the maester is willing to drink from poisoned wine just to kill her suggests the enormity of her influence. That she somehow can\u2019t be poisoned? That\u2019s something else. We also get a brief impression of one of Stannis\u2019 advisors, Davos (Liam Cunningham), who doesn\u2019t trust Melisandre, but is full of good ideas like allying with Renly and not drinking from poisoned chalices.\nAt the Stark camp, there\u2019s a relatively brief check-in with Robb and the northern lords, the main component of which is a tense conversation with the imprisoned Jaime Lannister, which is really a show of power for Robb and his fucking terrifying pet direwolf. More interesting is Robb balancing his new duties as a leader with the emotions of his mother, who just wants her kids back. (By the way, if you haven\u2019t checked out Arrested Westeros yet, you really should.) Catelyn, as we well know, is probably the least interested in leading the North to triumph and independence\u2014she knew from the minute that Ned was summoned to King\u2019s Landing that her family's relatively peaceful life would be forever disturbed. But she assents to go to Renly to try and win him over for an alliance, telling Robb his father would be proud. Robb doesn\u2019t seem so sure\u2014is he afraid that he can\u2019t live up to that standard, or just disturbed at the idea that Ned really isn\u2019t coming back?\nWith Ned gone, it feels like we\u2019re not seeing the show through the eyes of the Starks anymore. That\u2019s never been totally true, of course, but season one really was about the Starks\u2014season two is obviously going to be about everyone. Still, along with Robb, there\u2019s a check-in with Bran, who\u2019s conducting the court at Winterfell with far more civility than Joffrey, and a very brief glimpse of Arya, heading north with Gendry and the Night\u2019s Watch.\nSpeaking of the Watch, one cliffhanger from season one that I had forgotten about was Jon and the boys going into the shit (that is, Beyond the Wall). Here\u2019s what we can report back so far: It\u2019s very snowy, the Watch is taking refuge with some sort of master of incest who marries his daughters and kills his sons, and Jon\u2019s pretty face is once again doing him a disservice. This is all to figure out just how many death zombies are coming to take over Westeros, right? Man, the Watch really gets handed the shittiest jobs of all.\nWe spend the most time in King\u2019s Landing, which is still reeling from the death of Ned and the crowning of nasty old Joffrey. The first scene offers a disquieting vision of the new normal: When you put a psychotic, spoiled little kid in charge of everything, fucked up shit is going to happen. It\u2019s not just that he\u2019s having men fight for his amusement and nearly drowning a drunken (well-meaning) knight to death in wine. It\u2019s that it\u2019s all going on in front of poor Sansa, who's still unfortunately betrothed to her father\u2019s murderer and having to robotically parrot lines about her father and brother\u2019s great betrayal and her loyalty to her \u201cbeloved Joffrey.\u201d It\u2019s clearly unsettling for everyone (the Hound, who has a strange soft spot for Sansa, speaks up for her at one point) but especially Tyrion, who has returned from battle to clean up his nephew\u2019s mess.\nWhen Ned was running things at King\u2019s Landing, there was a delicate interplay of influence at work\u2014Petyr Baelish in charge of the money, Varys the spymaster, Pycelle the pious master of books and science. Now that Ned and Robert are gone, there\u2019s a real power vacuum, and it\u2019s hard to know how the chips will fall, considering Joffrey\u2019s impetuousness. One would presume that Cersei would wield the most control, given her link to her son. Indeed, Cersei certainly seems to think so until one of the episode\u2019s best scenes, where she slaps her son for talking about Robert\u2019s many bastard children, and Joffrey does not fall in line.\nYou could say the jig is up for Cersei the minute Tyrion shows up, because everyone\u2019s favorite character (now the nominal lead of the show, going by credits order) clearly has his sister\u2019s number and has been dispatched by Tywin to stop Joffrey from doing stupid things like chopping off Ned Stark\u2019s head. But as long as Cersei can control her son, she\u2019ll wield real power\u2014which is what makes that closing scene so effective.\nThe idea of Tyrion in charge at King\u2019s Landing is a very exciting one and probably the best twist of the episode in terms of what it promises for the future. Unchecked by his sneering, icy father or his dazzling brother, Tyrion finally has the ability to really get up to something, although he obviously faces the problem of how to deal with Cersei, who is not thrilled at being called \u201cthe disappointing child\u201d by her hated brother. I think Tyrion says it with a modicum of sympathy, having disappointed his family for so long, and he obviously isn\u2019t at King\u2019s Landing just to wreak chaos. He\u2019s his father\u2019s son in a way\u2014a tactician, trying to convince his sister to trade the captured Stark children for Jaime\u2019s return.\nStill, Cersei does have another ace in the hole: the gold-armored city watch and Janos Slynt (Dominic Carter), who will allow her to wield real influence within the city, if nothing else. Her scene with Petyr where she demonstrates her power by having the watch seize him and almost kill him (and then do the hokey pokey around him) felt like a mirror image of poor Ned\u2019s interactions with Littlefinger last year. Cersei\u2019s clearly not one to dance around the matter at hand, and she\u2019s not afraid to use brute force to get what she wants. \u201cKnowledge is power,\u201d Petyr mocks, before being manhandled by the watch. \u201cPower is power,\u201d Cersei tells him, and at least in the short term, she\u2019s right.\nThe watch also figures in the episode\u2019s big finale, killing all of Robert\u2019s bastard kids (except for Gendry, who\u2019s travelling to the Wall with Arya) in a squirm-inducing montage that includes the off-screen offing of a screaming baby. The scene works as a chilling break-off point to end the episode, but it doesn\u2019t feel like the episode was leading up to that point in particular; it\u2019s just a nice moment to end things on. The show still has that novelistic feel, especially in these early table-setting episodes, so I can\u2019t expect a dazzling twist for each week\u2019s ending. But after watching \u201cThe North Remembers,\u201d I\u2019d be crazy to say I\u2019m not pumped for episode two.\n", "episode_13": "\nThis Game Of Thrones post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.Near the end of an odd, shapeless season, it\u2019s nice to see Game Of Thrones still has the capacity to surprise. And surprise in a way that doesn\u2019t punish the viewer: When the army of the dead converged on Hardhome tonight, it was the kind of hair-raising thrill that season five has often struggled to muster. We know so much about how this show works now, have so many expectations for the patterns it follows, that surprises don\u2019t come as readily as they once did. \u201cHardhome\u201d is a welcome reminder that you know nothing, Game Of Thrones viewer.For example: The series has twice reserved a season\u2019s penultimate episode for the type of full-scale battle that\u2019s condensed into the final 15 minutes of \u201cHardhome.\u201d But even if you weren\u2019t anticipating that Stannis\u2019 march on Winterfell would monopolize next week\u2019s episode, there\u2019s still a rollercoaster-like stomach drop when the Night\u2019s Watch/Free Folk rowing parties look back to see puffs of snow gathering above the mountains. Jon, Tormund, and the others came to Hardhome to warn the clans of what might happen if they don\u2019t ally with the crows. They don\u2019t have to wait long for the White Walkers and the wights to validate their argument.Taking on the work previously handled by Neil Marshall, Miguel Sapochnik overcomes initial frenzy to lay out an attack depicted in beat-by-beat intricacy. He\u2019s helped by the characters that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have sent over the wall: Unlike \u201cBlackwater\u201d and \u201cThe Watchers On The Wall,\u201d we only have to keep track of Jon Snow and Tormund Giantsbane after the dead breech the gates. (The author now recognizes and acknowledges the delegates of the Eddison Tollett Fan Club, so I guess there are technically three entry points into the fracas.) This keeps the sequence\u2019s ambitions in check, but makes sense out of the hack-and-slash chaos. It also drives home the predicament facing our protagonists: The dread sinks deeper because \u201cHardhome\u201d makes its centerpiece feel like a handful of warriors facing an army of thousands. Drilling down even deeper, it\u2019s the story of a solitary figure squaring off against insurmountable odds. Jon Snow sails into enemy territory to persuade his sworn enemies to take up arms against a mythically unbeatable opposition. The progression of the battle reinforces the difficulty of this task and confirms the necessity of a unified front. There\u2019s no common strategy for holding back the wights. The only weapon proven effective against the White Walkers is left behind in a burning hut. In the heat of the fight, Sapochnik zeroes in on Jon, whose entire mission fails if he leaves that messenger bag full of dragonglass behind. To his surprise (and ours), Jon discovers that the weapon he needed was at his side the whole time: Longclaw\u2019s Valyrian steel first parries a blow from a White Walker, then shatters the same Walker into a million icy pieces. Another praise-worthy aspect of \u201cHardhome\u201d: Amid all the pandemonium, the episode conveys new information.It\u2019s all about wind up and release with this one, tension and suspense that are sustained and renewed multiple times within the sequence. It\u2019s a situation born of tension, as the Night Watch aren\u2019t exactly greeted as liberators when they land at Hardhome. Nothing\u2019s at ease about the last 30 minutes of tonight\u2019s episode, a feeling that violence can break out at any second established by Tormund lashing out at (and killing) the Lord of Bones. That\u2019s some brutal expediency, mirrored in the swiftness with which the camp finds itself besieged by the dead. But the episode\u2019s breathlessness is not without its moments of sharp inhalation: There\u2019s a momentary relief when the White Walkers send their troops spilling over the cliffs, a macabre beat of lemming-like physical comedy that\u2019s cut off when the piles of bodies suddenly find their feet. (Underlining the scene\u2019s sharp right turn into terror: What once previously looked like storm clouds and sounded like thunder was actually the initial wave of plummeting wights and the snow they lifted into the air.) The parting shot from the White Walkers\u2019 master has more direct aim, as he strides to the edge of the dock and wakens the recently slaughtered. The point is chillingly succinct: The Walkers kill merely to replenish their infantry.And so the closing argument in Jon\u2019s recruitment effort is made in defeat. The common enemy of all houses, clans, and armies makes no distinctions between who it fights alongside. The lines dividing the Free Folk and the Night\u2019s Watch run deep, long, and twisted, but if the living can\u2019t put aside those differences, the White Walkers will do it for them. A tight focus makes the battle at Hardhome a filmmaking success, but the impact of the sequence reverberates beyond the characters we follow to these shores. Game Of Thrones\u2019 warring factions all face the same foe, one whose advance renders moot the struggle for the Iron Throne. Earlier in the episode, Daenerys imagines that struggle as a perpetually rotating wheel, each noble house taking a turn at the top until the next, unavoidable rotation. But it won\u2019t matter which spoke on the Lannister-Baratheon-Stark-Tyrell-Targaryen wheel winds up on top if that wheel is rolling over a frozen landscape. Dany\u2019s wheel metaphor arises during another tense negotiation, that between the Mother of Dragons and Meereen\u2019s latest visitor. Tyrion spends \u201cHardhome\u201d defending his life to Daenerys, proving his worth as an advisor and an ally in a meeting of minds four-plus seasons in the making. There\u2019s plenty of reiteration going on in these scenes, but Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke play their exchanges with such spark and intrigue, it hardly matters how expositional they get. And as wonky as season five has been, there\u2019s little harm in reminding the audience what\u2019s at stake south of The Wall\u2014or hinting at how these characters were connected long before they met.\u201cHardhome\u201d picks up where \u201cThe Gift\u201d left off, with Tyrion and Jorah granted a formal audience before the queen. In the eerie quiet of The Great Pyramid, Tyrion begins the debate that lasts him the whole episode, recognizing that Dany might as well order his execution then and there. But the bad blood between the Lannisters and the Targaryens hasn\u2019t touched Dany directly, so it\u2019s Jorah\u2019s crimes that are at the front of her mind. Her testing of Tyrion begins with his advice on the Mormont situation, and though neither would be where they\u2019re at without Jorah\u2019s assistance, they mutually agree that his betrayal of Dany\u2019s trust is inexcusable. (Even if it was in the service of their shared ally, Varys.) The strain between the queen and her most devoted follower is a subtle tearjerker, but she stands by her prior decision to cast him out. Between the fighting pits and her betrothal, Dany has ceded so much ground recently, but this is one area where she refuses to compromise. Jorah must go, but Tyrion stays, his sardonic take on the situation (\u201cI thought you were worth meeting at the very least\u201d) providing a grim stretch of episodes with a much needed burst of humor.While Tyrion proves his worth to Dany (and he decides whether she deserves his services), the Westerosi history flies fast and furious. In proving his lineage and his knowledge, Tyrion rattles off the queen\u2019s biography: born during a terrible storm; frequent target of assassination; accumulator of wealth, land, armies, and dragons. Later, \u201cthe right kind of terrible\u201d serves as a jumping off point for a discussion of their intersecting family histories. \u201cHardhome\u201d is firmly rooted in the present, but it keeps an eye on the future and its mind on the past. Those last two factors are closely related: For Tyrion, Dany, and the Wildling chieftain played by Borgen\u2019s Birgitte Hjort S\u00f8rensen, there\u2019s a desire to forget the past, to give up on old rivalries and old ways of thinking, and move forward. Among royalty, that\u2019s articulated in ominous metaphors about breaking the wheel, but the Free Folk don\u2019t fell the need to be so flowery about their ancestors: \u201cFuck \u2019em, they\u2019re dead,\u201d S\u00f8rensen\u2019s character says. While others extricate themselves from ancient history, Arya distances herself from the recent past. In a training session with Jaqen H\u2019ghar, she traces the backstory and daily routine of Lana, the oyster merchant she\u2019s posing as in the streets of Braavos. Staying on the right side of mysterious, Arya\u2019s tutelage has entered its practical, \u201cLuke Skywalker walks into a cave\u201d phase. Rather than encountering a shadow version of herself, however, Lana builds a relationship with a gambler who wagers on the safe passage of ships sailing from Braavos. This is her first target as a Faceless Man; when she accepts the assignment, the smile on Maisie Williams\u2019 face could light up the House of Black and White for days.This is another area where \u201cHardhome\u201d surprises, playfully blurring the lines between Lana and Arya with costuming and voiceover narration. At first, it\u2019s not clear if the images we\u2019re seeing are only in her mind\u2019s eye, as the onscreen action jumps between Lana\u2019s walk to the canals and Arya speaking to Jaqen H\u2019ghar, returning to the House of Black and White when she makes a geographical error. Too many training sequences like this could grow tedious, but the procedural element is something new and novel for Game Of Thrones\u2014and some exciting forward motion for Arya to boot. It\u2019s a week of incremental victories for House Stark. Arya is working her way up the Faceless Men ladder, Jon wins over a handful of Wildlings (and escapes Hardhome with his life and some new combat experience), and Sansa learns that she might not be so alone after all. Sansa\u2019s rage at her imprisonment mixes with her hatred for Theon this week, resulting in an explosion of emotions that gets Reek (there is no Theon, no Dana either\u2014only Reek) to admit he didn\u2019t kill Bran and Rickon. In this brief scene, Sansa is every woman in \u201cHardhome\u201d: Receiving a glimmer of hope (like Arya), railing against her captors (like Cersei), and considering a confession from a man who betrayed her (like Dany). It\u2019s a charged scene for Turner, glaring down at Alfie Allen in profile, the actors backlit so that they look like a variation on the \u201cVase or two faces?\u201d illusion in which the left side of the vase blames the right side for multiple family tragedies. And with the leverage she now has on Reek, she ought to be standing a few extra heads above him in that shot.Whether it prompts the characters to come clean or not, confession is a major motif running through the first half of \u201cHardhome.\u201d Theon does it under duress, Tyrion does it by way of proving his identity (\u201cI am the greatest Lannister killer of our time\u201d), and Cersei refuses to do it though it would mean her freedom. Cersei\u2019s predicament practically lends credence to the Free Folk who refuse Jon\u2019s offer, as she put in her lot with the Faith Militant, only to be double-crossed by its members. Rather than strengthening Cersei\u2019s authority, the faith has stripped it of her entirely. While she\u2019s drinking spilled water from a dungeon floor, Kevan\u2019s been summoned back to King\u2019s Landing, where he serves as hand of the king and runs the small council. Could this all be a conspiracy orchestrated by a spurned Lannister uncle? Is Lancel a sparrow, or is he a double agent doing his dad\u2019s bidding in order to undermine the royal family? There is a difference between the alliance Jon Snow seeks and the one Cersei formed, of course. Cersei partnered with the sparrows and reinstated the Faith Militant out of self-interest, seeking to maintain a status quo that most benefits herself and her family. The enemy she thought they shared was every noble who wasn\u2019t a Lannister\u2014but the fallout from Lancel\u2019s confession and absolution demonstrate that not even the lion is safe from the faith. Say what you will about the High Sparrow, but at least he\u2019s committed to helping his fellow men, women, and children\u2014just as Jon\u2019s trying to do by holding the White Walkers at bay. Jon keeps his target locked on the Walkers, though. The Faith Militant has a wandering eye in that regard, and they\u2019re not afraid to turn that eye on someone they\u2019d previously partnered with. That\u2019s unpleasant, as far as surprises go.", "episode_12": "\nThis Game Of Thrones post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.The cutest little girl who ever graced Game Of Thrones tells us the story of the title, \u201cThe Dance Of Dragons.\u201d It was a war of succession between two Targaryen siblings that sounds basically like the violence and bloodshed we\u2019ve been witnessing ever since Shireen\u2019s uncle, King Robert, got taken out by his wife and her fuck buddy/cousin, with Stannis and Renly taking the place of the Targaryens. Now Stannis asks his daughter which Targaryen she\u2019d have supported. Shireen says she wouldn\u2019t choose between them. As Kenneth Parcell knew, choosing is a sin, and in this case, it\u2019s the sin at the root of all the ensuing bloodshed.In the War of the Five Kings, who would you choose? For a while Game Of Thrones offered strong rooting interests for the audience, charismatic, relatively just leaders like Ned Stark and Tyrion Lannister pulling the levers of power. Nowadays I\u2019m just hoping poor Sansa even survives this damn story. But as for the questions of the throne, we\u2019re trapped between a blizzard and fillicide. Sitting on the throne is a sweet, impotent child, an extraordinarily lifelike puppet operated by his mother, the hilariously myopic Cersei Lannister. The \u201crightful\u201d king, in the sense that King Robert had no trueborn heirs and so the throne should have passed to his eldest brother, is Stannis, a hardass being carried to power by fundamentalists who were introduced by burning Stannis\u2019 relatives at the stake for not converting. He has one of the most skillful players in the whole game at his side in Davos, but he also has Melisandre clouding his vision. And in the final corner, for now, is Dany, who strikes me as a pretender who\u2019s very good at giving off a \u201cdon\u2019t fuck with me\u201d vibe and far less good at actually learning how to rule. But she at least believes in things like \u201cpeople shouldn\u2019t kill each other for entertainment\u201d and \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t rape the women in the village you\u2019ve conquered,\u201d and she\u2019s always had a strong group of advisers around her, from Drogo and Jorah to Daario and Tyrion. I could see rooting for Stannis and Davos, but imagine Selyse in Cersei\u2019s position. Would all the commoners have to convert or die? Similarly I could see rooting for Dany, but she doesn\u2019t inspire a lot of confidence. People have been mocking her lack of game plan for years now. \u201cThe Dance Of Dragons\u201d may not choose among the kings, exactly, but it crosses one name off the list and furiously highlights another.Stannis burning his daughter Shireen at the stake is the hardest Game Of Thrones has hit since the Red Wedding, only this violence is completely drained of excitement. It\u2019s not a shock moment, and there\u2019s no gross-out gore as in Oberyn\u2019s death. Instead it\u2019s a long, cold death march. What\u2019s most impressive is the pacing, which is not the season\u2019s strongest suit. Think about how rarely characters are seen on the way to and from places. In previous seasons, the journey was half the plot. Nowadays we don\u2019t see Lady Olenna until she\u2019s outside King\u2019s Landing, and Jon and Tormund are off the map between Castle Black and Hardhome, both ways. Dany takes forever to figure out what to do about the fighting pits, just long enough for Jorah and Tyrion to cross a continent. It takes Mace Tyrell almost as long to cross the Narrow Sea as it does for Arya to go through all that training, first Arya as a mortician or whatever and second Lana as a seashell seller. But here, at last, taking a page from \u201cHardhome,\u201d Game Of Thrones takes time to give its story weight. What\u2019s going to happen is going to happen, barring a last-minute reprieve\u2014and even then we have to get to that last minute\u2014from the moment Stannis dismisses Davos. Which makes that scene hard to watch on its own. Stannis is sending away the only person in camp apart from the child he\u2019s about to execute who might speak reason, and he knows it. And Davos knows it, too, at least on some level. He tries to rescue Shireen, and that\u2019s the moment I think Stannis finally pulls the trigger. Davos is not going to take his daughter away from him, except once Davos is dismissed, Stannis might as well be completely under Melisandre\u2019s spell, so he\u2019s losing Shireen anyway. Davos brings Shireen a hand-carved wooden stag toy as a goodbye present for Shireen. He thanks her for teaching him to read, and speaks of her as a surrogate child. It brings me back to Arya and Ned, who provides perhaps the show\u2019s only other example of unselfish paternal love (as opposed to Cersei\u2019s perverted version). Game Of Thrones so rarely gives us anything sweet that moments like this are all the more potent. And then Stannis sits with his daughter, really confronts what he\u2019s about to do, and Shireen tells and shows him exactly why it\u2019s a bad idea. She returns the baton he passed a few weeks ago: \u201cI\u2019m Princess Shireen of House Baratheon, and I\u2019m your daughter.\u201d The Dance Of Dragons is quite a parable here if only Dad would listen. What\u2019s more, for a long time Stannis\u2019 love for his daughter was his only redeeming, human quality. Without that he\u2019d just be a law-and-order robot. As it happens, he\u2019s not just a law-and-order robot. He\u2019s a tragic monster who, if I read the fire correctly, literally every single viewer is now gleefully anticipating dying. But first the tragic part. The execution scene is excruciating, not viscerally like Sansa\u2019s rape but more tonally. It\u2019s like embers cooling. Whatever hope we may have had for this plot is dead. The actual execution sequence is constructed like that rape scene. After the merciless setup, that long walk through the armed men, Melisandre peeking out at the front, soldiers physically tying the child to the stake, we see Shireen on the pyre briefly and then the rest is the sounds of her agony\u2014dragonlike cries, if you ask me\u2014over reaction shots from everyone else. The surprising one is Selyse breaking, illustrating how far-gone Stannis is by comparison and how much blood relations mean in this universe where Theon could flip on his adopted family so easily and Cat could hold such a grudge against Jon Snow. Not even Selyse could go through with this.Melisandre stands there happy to be of service. What service, though, I wonder? The mechanics have been conveniently vague from the moment she pulled the headache excuse to get out of making another shadow with Stannis\u2019 face to kill Roose Bolton. \u201cYour fires run low,\u201d she tells Stannis. Well how high are his fires going to run now that he\u2019s killed his own brother and his own daughter? I bet Stannis himself becomes a shadow after this. Speaking of Shireen and Renly, just who is supposed to inherit the throne after Stannis now? Think it through, pal. And what of the blood magic? Is Roose about to just drop dead? Because, you know, that one leech named Balon Greyjoy is sure taking its sweet time. And yet, as the episode opens, we seem to witness Melisandre genuinely staring into fire and reading the future, seeing that the camp is about to burn. She hasn\u2019t been wrong yet, but this \u201csacrifice\u201d doesn\u2019t just mean the death of Roose Bolton or whomever. It means the death of Stannis.And that\u2019s not even the climax, because this is a zero-sum game. As Stannis sinks, Dany soars, and she does so by strengthening her family ties, rather than burning them at the stake. There\u2019s a lot going on at the fighting pit\u2014Daario and Hizdahr\u2019s pissing match, Tyrion bonding with Dany over disgust for the fighting, Jorah and Dany having the world\u2019s most passive-aggressive fight\u2014but all of that falls by the wayside when Jorah, victorious, drinking in the boos of the audience, grabs a spear and hurls it at the stage where Dany and company are gathered. After just long enough for the audience to collect its breath, the spear turns out to have stopped a murderous Son of the Harpy sneaking up behind Dany. Suddenly, the insurgents are everywhere, and the former masters are dropping like flies. I get being scared for the heroes in \u201cHardhome,\u201d but this sequence offers way more characters we\u2019d (I\u2019d) rather not see killed off. Missandei\u2019s a target until Tyrion slices his way through her attacker. Jorah fights his way to Dany\u2019s side, and the two finally reconcile in the heat of battle.Hizdahr bites it, but the episode goes out of its way to make him expendable to us first by having him engage in a battle of wits with Tyrion in which his main argument is greatness can\u2019t be accomplished without cruelty. How elegant that he dies shortly thereafter as part of the great liberating movement of the Sons of the Harpy. \u201cThe Dance Of Dragons\u201d really stacks the deck in case we weren\u2019t sure how to feel about characters like Stannis or Dany. Just look at Meryn Trant. Dude \u201ckilled\u201d Syrio (I\u2019m a truther on this front; show me the body) and beat Sansa, but just in case we forgot who he is, he\u2019s reintroduced as an asshole who badmouths the man he\u2019s there to protect, gets in a good homophobic remark, and then turns out to have criminally young tastes in women at the brothel whose employees he treats like property, which adds some disquieting context to the earlier scenes of him either faintly recognizing Arya in the streets or just scoping out an underage conquest. Anyway, Arya doesn\u2019t kill him quite yet. So far he\u2019s just here to give Arya the dilemma between becoming faceless and killing the insurance salesman or remaining Arya and crossing names off her list, but Arya stalking her prey is every bit as rich as the other major sequences.The danger has never been more palpable in Meereen as when Dany, Jorah, Daario, Missandei, and Tyrion are surrounded in the middle of the fighting pits. Jorah and Daario can only take out so many insurgents on their own. Dany and Missandei don\u2019t even have weapons. They\u2019re just waiting to die. The close-up of Dany taking Missandei\u2019s hand is so vivid I\u2019m practically getting misty now. All of a sudden Drogon screeches in the distance, and everyone stops and looks. Soon enough he\u2019s flying around the arena inexplicably not torching every Son he sees. He does get down to war eventually, but on the ground. He\u2019s a jet playing a tank. He clambers forward at the camera and bites into some guy like it\u2019s Jurassic Park, and then he starts roasting people. He also takes a few spears in the side, and for a moment I wondered if they might actually take the dragon out. That\u2019s a red herring. So is the moment Dany pulls a spear out and Drogon screams in her face. Instead what happens is Dany climbs on his back and flies her dragon out of there. I repeat: Dany rides a dragon! The CGI could use some polish, but nothing short of Shireen can turn my smile upside down.It would have been nice for Drogon to make sure everyone else is safe, or hell, to carry them, too. It looks like most of the Sons are dead, but the plot mechanics are off, because danger is what necessitates Dany getting on Drogon\u2019s back in the first place. And where\u2019s Drogon going anyway? Regardless, Dany and Drogon make an excellent rebuke to Stannis. The tragedy of The Dance Of Dragons, and \u201cThe Dance With Dragons,\u201d is blood turning on blood.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.No Game Of Thrones character is truly safe. The series premiere ends with a young boy being pushed out of a window; nine episodes later, his father, the show\u2019s ostensible protagonist, is beheaded. Descriptions like these make the show sound every bit the meat grinder it\u2019s criticized for being, and an episode like \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy\u201d provides plenty of fodder for such criticisms. Let\u2019s run the body count for the fifth season finale: Selyse Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon, Myranda, Sansa Stark (assumed), Reek (n\u00e9 Theon Greyjoy, assumed), Meryn Trant, Myrcella Baratheon (technically Lannister), Cersei\u2019s hair, hundreds of unnamed soldiers on the battlefield outside Winterfell, and Jon Snow. No wonder HBO put a sixth season on the books back in April 2014\u2014Game Of Thrones needs all the time it can get to restock the casting cupboard. And though the ends of so many watches make for the highest-stakes finale in the history of the show\u2014on top of fateful turns for Arya, Daenerys, and Cersei\u2014the timing of it all leaves something to be desired.Game Of Thrones\u2019 fifth season is a powerful demonstration of the advantages and disadvantages of TV serialization. The past three weeks saw the show delivering three consecutive knockouts, triumphs of Game Of Thrones\u2019 massive scale, sense of suspense, and ability to affect its audience\u2019s emotions. But it could only get to this point after a spell of dawdling and meandering, threads gathered to build up new villains (Stannis\u2019 thirsty devolution into tragic figure; the silent and not-so-silent rises of the Sons of the Harpy and the Faith Militant) and poke at the wounds of old grudges (Night\u2019s Watch v. Free Folk; Lannister v. Martell; Stark v. Bolton; Snow v. Night\u2019s Watch; Ramsay Bolton v. common decency). It never completely lost its way, but season five lost a touch of eventfulness in preparation for the events of the past three episodes.So \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy\u201d raises the question: Was it all worth it? Do we accept the Dorne storyline\u2019s dull developments in vivid settings for the devastating payoff in \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy\u201d? Not really, but it seems as though there was no salvaging that corner of the Game Of Thrones map, a too-inconsequential representation of the show\u2019s basest impulses, best represented in Tyene\u2019s ridiculous parting words to Bronn:  Still, other conclusions justify the wanderings that precede them. I\u2019m thinking especially of Jon Snow\u2019s season-five arc, in which he attempts to lead with fairness and compassion in a world that\u2019s ready to reward neither of those qualities. Kit Harington nails Jon\u2019s downfall in his exit interview with Entertainment Weekly, noting that his character only had an eye on the big picture, preparing for a White Walker assault while more pressing threats rose up around him. \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy\u201d casts ominous shadows in Jon\u2019s direction, isolating the late lord commander in his quarters and restricting interactions with the men under his supervision. He allows his only genuine ally to take leave of The Wall; when he\u2019s out and about, it\u2019s only to check in with Ser Davos. An intrusion by Olly, Castle Black\u2019s diminutive angel of death, can only mean bad things to come. Jon possesses neither Dany\u2019s willingness to compromise (nor a dragon to bail him out of a sticky situation), for which he pays the ultimate price. He\u2019s the show\u2019s most symbolic sacrifice on the altar of good intentions, a martyr offering himself up in the name of Not Ready for Westeros ideals. And it\u2019s kind of a relief that he\u2019s gone (though let\u2019s reserve an \u201cuntil proven otherwise\u201d clause here, since there\u2019s a red priestess in Castle Black), because that position was starting to stick in Game Of Thrones\u2019 gullet. Like nearly every victim of \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy,\u201d Jon Snow had served his purpose: He was the audience\u2019s eyes on the wall and the good heart that couldn\u2019t change the minds of career warriors and hardened criminals. The significance of the \u201ctraitor\u201d sign goes beyond Jon\u2019s oath: his beliefs and his leadership style run counter to the way things are done in the known world. A single person can\u2019t change that\u2014not without at least three dragons.And I think that\u2019s why every little twist of the knife in season five stings more than it would have in a previous season. There\u2019s a revolutionary spirit to Game Of Thrones, but there\u2019s also the stark recognition that a) revolution is a lengthy, bloody process, and b) these characters ought to have dire circumstances to revolt against. The show\u2019s balance of light and dark is a major part of its complexity, but dark consistently won out this season. Neither quantity will ever be the undisputed champion of George R.R. Martin\u2019s universe, but season five belonged to the darkness\u2014watch as Jon\u2019s blood blots out its white backdrop in the closing shot\u2014and that made it a particularly grueling viewing experience. In Cersei\u2019s confession and subsequent atonement, \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy\u201d brings this feeling to its peak. More than any instance of violence in season five, the sequence signals that the dam is ready to burst in Westeros: The people of King\u2019s Landing are furious, and their fury is being stoked by an organization that wants to restore old, old, old ways of thinking and governing. Making us see this from Cersei\u2019s perspective is a massive achievement. Game Of Thrones has always done well to make Cersei a figure of metered sympathy, a selfish, conniving elitist who nonetheless loves her children intensely and harbors a love that dare not speak its name. In the long walk from the sept to the Red Keep, \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy\u201d does the near impossible: It makes the audience pity Cersei Lannister, full stop.It\u2019s all about the extremes: The length, the language, the viscera, the nudity. It\u2019s a massive undertaking, requiring hordes of extras and employing an effective blend of filmmaking techniques, with POV shots that put the viewer in Cersei\u2019s place and handheld camerawork that sells the turbulence of the situation. Director David Nutter makes it feel as though all of King\u2019s Landing has turned out to witness Cersei\u2019s humbling, the overwhelming size of the crowd illustrated in wide angles and closeups alike. Marching along to the hypnotic rhythm of a clanging bell and the septa\u2019s \u201cShame. Shame. Shame\u201d chant, it\u2019d be easy to lose a sense of time, were it not for the escalating unrest of the crowds and the diminishing distance to the Red Keep. The closer Cersei is to her home, the less she looks like her old self, the courtly countenance she holds for her first few hundred steps overwhelmed by insults, projectile garbage, and plain old emotion. The sequence takes up a significant amount of airtime, but it must go long in order to have an impact.  Lena Headey\u2019s work during the walk of atonement impresses even before the sequence\u2019s three-day production is taken into account. Without any dialogue, she must portray Cersei\u2019s journey physically, twisting her face as her character drops the mask of dignity to acknowledge the arduous task ahead. At the center of swirling, angry activity, she gives a performance that would be compelling all on its own, as pride gives way to vulnerability, which in turn gives way to a delirious defiance. It\u2019s award fodder for sure, a full range of emotion tidily compressed into a single, traumatizing march\u2014a more apt analogy for season five than David Benioff and D.B. Weiss may have intended. Because escape from Game Of Thrones\u2019 hellish existence is its own kind of godsend (with its own god within the Faith of the Seven), the \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy\u201d Olympics of feature events beyond death. There\u2019s also the loss of one\u2019s senses, the fate Arya now faces after placing a personal vendetta above of her Faceless Men duties. The Starks just can\u2019t catch a break, especially when they\u2019re leaning on the fact that they\u2019re Starks: After pledging herself to a nameless existence, Arya slips up and identifies herself to the dying Meryn Trant. Her final words to the first name on her list should\u2019ve been a reminder to herself: \u201cYou\u2019re no one. You\u2019re nothing.\u201dThere\u2019s a lot of Faceless Men trickery in Braavos tonight, beginning with Arya\u2019s disguise in the brothel and ending with Jaqen H\u2019ghar in the House of Black and White. Call me Lucille Bluth, because I fall for this Gene Parmesan tomfoolery every time\u2014but it works well in the momentous context of the season finale. These scenes raise some tough questions, however, including but not limited to \u201cWas The Waif actually Jaqen this whole time?\u201d, \u201cWhat are the limits of this storytelling device?\u201d, and \u201cGene Parmesan?\u201d (\u201cRight here!\u201d) But I have to give credit to \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy\u201d for pulling one gasp after another in the House of Black and White, the most satisfying of season five\u2019s new settings\u2014even though (or maybe because) most of its mysteries remain unsolved.With Arya blinded, Sansa is facing some tough competition for the title of unluckiest Stark in \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy.\u201d Fortunately/unfortunately for her, she has that old Winterfell poor sense of timing on her side: While the Boltons rally an army to meet Stannis\u2019 skeleton crew, Sansa dons her finest hood, grabs that corkscrew she stole a few weeks back, and finally makes it to the Broken Tower. Even more so than Arya\u2019s revenge and Jon\u2019s hoped-for reunion with his long-lost uncle, this is where the season finale smites whatever Game Of Thrones viewers come to this show with untempered optimism. Sansa\u2019s candle is seconds too late to catch the attention of Pod and Brienne, who spot the approaching Baratheon troops before they can see the Broken Tower distress signal. Forget the direwolf: At this point, the Stark sigil ought to be a lonely little flame, dancing for a recipient with other things on their mind. Those priorities give \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy\u201d some of its meatiest material, thoughts worth chewing on as we continue to sort through the carnage of season five. Even though Arya goes overboard in avenging the death of Syrio Forel\u2014not only gagging her victim, but setting up her own comeuppance by gouging his eyes out\u2014the act receives a triumphant framing. The same can be said for Brienne as she stands over a dying Stannis, confirming the provenance of Renly\u2019s murder and fulfilling a pledge to her late lord. With the mist rolling through the background and Brienne acting out the chivalric motions, her side of the exchange is nothing if not heroic. But her quarry is immobilized and badly wounded, already resigned to defeat when he hears Brienne\u2019s footsteps approaching. His last words are not those of a man willing to die for his cause. Instead, they\u2019re the resignation of someone about to be put out of his misery: \u201cGo on, do your duty.\u201d So what makes this any different from Ramsay picking off straggling Baratheon knights? Or Olly sticking Jon Snow after several others have stabbed the lord commander \u201cfor the watch\u201d? Arya\u2019s treatment of Trant wouldn\u2019t look out of place at the Dreadfort, and there\u2019s an explicit parallel drawn between Brienne and Ramsay, as Brienne\u2019s execution of Stannis is connected to one of Ramsay\u2019s kills by jump cut. After its bleakest, most violent season to date, Game Of Thrones leaves the audience with 10 months to consider the bloodshed. If any character can go at any moment, what makes a death at all significant in this world? With Ellaria poisoning Myrcella, that makes three eye-for-an-eye killings in \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy.\u201d Does any of this compensate for the people our killers have lost?Offering up those kinds of questions, and building some ambiguity into their answers, means the cruelty and suffering on display in the show\u2019s fifth season wasn\u2019t just cruelty and suffering for cruelty and suffering\u2019s sake. Game Of Thrones isn\u2019t a premium-cable fighting pit\u2014it\u2019s an epic story that challenges viewers to think hard about their reactions to the brutality that\u2019s a part of that story. Because there\u2019s always going to be more to the show than sword fights and naked bodies; the sword fights and naked bodies are the sugar that makes the political allegory and family power dynamics go down. With Shireen burned at the stake last week and Sansa assaulted on her wedding night, the ugliness of season five tended to monopolize the conversation about the show, even as it made some intriguing points about leading through compromise and the dangers of fanaticism. (And sometimes it\u2019s just easier to dissect and comment on that ugliness. See also: This review.) With so many characters in so many different places, the family stuff kind of took a back seat this season\u2014which might be why portions of it felt so off-center. You know things have gone askew when the Boltons are the ones leading the discussions about family identity and loyalty.There\u2019s also an advantage of the way season five cleared the decks: It makes room for promising new starts like Jorah and Daario\u2019s search for Dany, Dany\u2019s time within a new (?) khalasar, and the administration of Grey Worm-Missandei-Tyrion-Varys. (Also: Westeros\u2019 answer to Banjo-Kazooie, Hodor and Bran, are still out there.) These episodes were as much of an endurance test as they were a television season, for better and for worse. Fortunately, \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy\u201d features more of the former, even as it put the screws to the viewers until the very end. ", "episode_10": "\nWelcome to another season of Game Of Thrones reviews for those who have not read the books the series is based on. Since critics won\u2019t be receiving screeners this season, each week I\u2019ll publish the episode page once the broadcast ends and add my review to the page when I finish. That way newbies have a spoiler-free place to discuss the episode as soon as possible. Spoilers are strictly forbidden. Any spoilers in comments will be deleted on sight. Remember: Discussions of things that were different in the books or confirmations of things that won\u2019t happen count as spoilers, too. Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.Everything else in \u201cThe Red Woman\u201d moves at such an overworked gallop that it\u2019s almost funny how the Jon Snow subplot just lies there. The thing everyone wants to know most is the one thing still awaiting resolution. The typical season premiere luxuriates in the new status quo. Past premiere subplots include Dany lost in the desert, Oberyn\u2019s arrival in King\u2019s Landing, and Tyrion and Varys making plans for a road trip. It\u2019s natural to have expected Theon and Sansa to spend more time trying to evade the Boltons before getting caught. Or Dany to endure her march a while before she gets an audience with the new khal. Or Jorah and Daario not to have already found the only three clues to her whereabouts in all of Essos. The pace of things on Game Of Thrones has sped up considerably since the early years kept promising us winter was coming. But lately it feels like producers are so focused on destinations they\u2019re missing the journeys. Then again, \u201cMother\u2019s Mercy\u201d is no typical season finale. It\u2019s edited for maximum momentum, jumping between trains and expecting us to know the abandoned cars get where they\u2019re going. And sure, enough, they did: Stannis is dead, and Arya is blind, at least for now. But it ends that way, too, with Jon Snow lying in a puddle of blood and a skeptical audience refusing to take producers\u2019 word for it that he\u2019s dead. In \u201cThe Red Woman,\u201d Alliser quotes the party line: \u201cJon Snow is dead.\u201d Sure, but so was Beric Dondarrion. And as Davos attests, Melisandre can do some shit. \u201cThe Red Woman\u201d doesn\u2019t burn or bury Jon, but it doesn\u2019t magically resurrect him, either. The Wall plot is fairly methodical for late Game Of Thrones. The mutineers have left Jon there in the snow, Ghost howls in anguish, and that alerts Davos to the scene. Dolorous Edd and Unnamed Jon Snow Allies one through five or so join them, and they hole up with Jon\u2019s body in one room soon to be under siege. While they plot their next move, Edd leaving to rouse some wildling backup, Alliser executes his, owning the treason with the other officers and marshaling the remaining troops. This is classic Game Of Thrones, dueling strategies and dire odds, and it\u2019s a delight precisely because it doesn\u2019t skip any steps. It lies in the bed it made.Davos\u2019 position at the Wall sets the stage for a whole episode of individuals in enemy (or at least frenemy) territory and precarious balances of power in the ruling courts of the world. That is, Meereen is one bad day away from harpy rule, King\u2019s Landing is overrun with the Faith Militant and the Lannisters apparently helpless to stop them, and Dorne undergoes a coup to make Ser Alliser proud. Well, at least Alliser stabs Jon from the front. The Sand Snakes conspicuously consolidate power through literal back-stabbing. When Doran gets the news about Myrcella\u2019s death (from whom and why, I wonder), tiny Obara stabs her tiny dagger in Areo Hotah\u2019s back. Meanwhile her sisters face Trystane on the ship, raising other questions the episode races to avoid, and soon enough a spearhead sprouts from his face. Credit where it\u2019s due: Ellaria Roose Boltons Prince Doran right in the heart and tells him why. He did nothing when Elia died. He did nothing when Oberyn died. \u201cWeak men will never rule Dorne again.\u201d But to be clear, Ellaria\u2019s argument is that they have grounds for war because Oberyn died in a duel. It\u2019s not clear what Doran could have done, legitimately, but she clearly isn\u2019t very big on legitimacy anyway. Murdering your family has to rank somewhere up there with betraying guest right, right?Doran and Jon are viciously betrayed for the same reason: They seek peace. They\u2019re leaders who won\u2019t go to war willy-nilly, even when they have been wronged. Season five offered some hope of the world escaping all these short-sighted power grabs. Both Shireen and Tyrion suggested opting out of the Iron Throne altogether to potential rulers, and Jon and Tormund actually managed a truce between the wildlings and the Night\u2019s Watch. \u201cThe Red Woman\u201d reveals Ellaria\u2019s cut from the same cloth as Alliser. They\u2019re too self-centered to see the big picture.It\u2019s an exciting moment, and a disappointing one for fans of Alexander Siddig and DeObia Oparei, who were cast to be betrayed. With a little more time spent endowing Sunspear and its characters and its culture, maybe even calling the capital by its name on the title credits map, it would feel more like payoff than just getting to the good stuff. As it is, the episode skips over the pesky details of conspiracy and boat-racing to get to the high points, just as the season before it skipped over the careful strategizing of seasons past to give us opposing kidnapping missions in broad daylight under the prince\u2019s very nose. The other subplots are a little rushed, but only Dany\u2019s skips that many steps. It\u2019s interesting to see what Dany would do in a subordinate position after all this time ruling cities, but the answer should be no surprise. She asserts her power. She is Daenerys Of House Targaryen, Rightful Queen Of The Andals And The First Men, Breaker Of Chains, Stormborn, The Unburnt, And Holder Of The Sacred Chalice Of Rixx. Khal Moro (Joe Naufahu) laughs at her until he finds out she\u2019s widow to Khal Drogo. That gains her some power and loses her some. She won\u2019t be subject to rape, and she\u2019ll likely be treated fairly well, but she doesn\u2019t have the freedom to choose her destiny. The widows of khals are supposed to live out their days in Vaes Dothrak, and Khal Moro is going to see that she does. The way things are going so far, Jorah and Daario will beat her there.\u201cThe Red Woman\u201d almost continues the five-year tradition of torturing Sansa, although at least she and Theon both survive the fall with all their limbs intact. But they cross an icy river, and the Bolton hounds still catch up to them. There\u2019s never any escape for Sansa. This is the old woman who told her, \u201cThe North remembers,\u201d all over again. I was huffing and puffing about this impossibly frustrating horror movie Sansa\u2019s trapped in when Brienne Of Tarth and Pod appear. The fight\u2019s tense, but the real power is what comes next, Brienne kneeling before Sansa and pledging her services once again. The parallelism is gutting. If only Sansa had accepted her service the last time, she might have avoided Ramsay and Myranda. She would have been spared so much torment. But now the four of them make a strange, exciting brotherhood, Sansa holding court, Brienne kneeling before her lady, Theon nodding his head to advise her, and Pod standing by dutifully. The wide shot of the ragged underdogs against the ugly, snowy waste is the image of the episode, an old nudist notwithstanding.The line of the episode belongs to Ser Alliser: \u201cI never once disobeyed an order.\u201d He\u2019s a trip. In his speech to the Night\u2019s Watch he then pivots to loyalty, which is the quality the Night\u2019s Watch needs most now that some people have chosen to be disloyal. The cognitive dissonance is hilarious, but it focuses the episode. There is something special about loyalty in \u201cThe Red Woman.\u201d There\u2019s a moment before Brienne arrives when Theon decides to sacrifice himself to protect Sansa. She refuses to leave without him, but he insists, both of them devoted to each other in this hellish scenario. Team Sansa only survives the Boltons through force, but they have a rare loyalty, and not the Jaime Lannister \u201cFuck everyone who isn\u2019t us\u201d kind, either. That\u2019s the quality Tyrion admires in Pod, that\u2019s the defining romantic virtue of Brienne, and that\u2019s what binds old friends, well, old surrogate family Sansa and Theon. Now they\u2019re something like a court held together with oaths and honor. It\u2019s unusually dramatically satisfying for this show, because Game Of Thrones insists on self-interest trumping virtue just about every time. The good guys don\u2019t win so much as the bad guys die, too. But here in \u201cThe Red Woman,\u201d Sansa and company make a stark contrast with the coups everywhere else. Disloyalty has been punished plenty over the seasons: Prince Theon, Rickard Karstark, the Red Wedding. Maybe loyalty stands a chance.A question of loyalty comes up three times at the Wall. In the beginning, as Davos and Edd discuss who they can trust, there\u2019s a knock on the door followed by Melisandre\u2019s voice. Which raises the question: Can they trust her? Melisandre and Davos are the polar opposites of Stannis\u2019 court, and now they\u2019re the two still together. For years he\u2019s struggled against her. She\u2019s had him thrown in the dungeons of Dragonstone, she\u2019s manipulated Stannis against him, and now she\u2019s responsible for the execution of Shireen and the collapse of Stannis\u2019 forces. The question comes up again when Alliser tries to negotiate. Actually he dictates terms; it\u2019s Davos who comically begins the negotiation. \u201cAnd some mutton. I\u2019d like some mutton.\u201d Alliser offfers to let Davos take Melisandre with him or leave her to them, but Davos doesn\u2019t answer. Not that he would show his cards yet, but it\u2019s an open question. How loyal is he to her after everything that\u2019s happened? But at the end, with no sign of wildling reinforcements, Davos decides Melisandre might be their only hope, and he admits to her powers. Which leads to a revelation about those powers. In her own room, she removes her jeweled necklace to climb into bed, and suddenly she reverts to her real form, that of an old woman. An old naked woman\u2014this is still Melisandre, after all. It\u2019s played for the grotesque, because it\u2019s a scene about spectacle rather than character. It\u2019s about revealing Melisandre\u2019s true form rather than playing the actual moment of Melisandre, apparently shaken in her faith, crawling into bed alone and defenseless at a castle in conflict. \u201cThe Red Woman\u201d doesn\u2019t shed any light on Jon Snow\u2019s fate, but it does tell us a little more about the power that may yet resuscitate him.", "episode_17": "\nThis Game Of Thrones post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.Generally, I\u2019m reluctant to assign too much significance to an episode title. Often, a title is merely lines on a page, words distinguishing one installment of a TV show from the next. But when that show has as many characters, storylines, and settings as Game Of Thrones, an episode\u2019s title provides a helpful roadmap\u2014not unlike the lay of the land(s) that introduces each new installment. Four weeks into season five, the episode titles fall together to form a picture of the unknown world that awaits us this year, newly introduced locations and characters representing a Westeros between wars.The most recent pair of episodes draw our attention to rebellious factions gaining support and power in King\u2019s Landing and Meereen: \u201cHigh Sparrow\u201d illuminates a rising fanaticism by introducing that fanatacism\u2019s leader; The Sons of the Harpy aren\u2019t onscreen for much of their eponymous episode, but they make their presence felt in a short amount of time. It\u2019s an honor befitting an organization that strikes at its enemy from the shadows, its actions in \u201cSons Of The Harpy\u201d more serpent-like than the so-called Sand Snakes who make their Game Of Thrones debut this week. (If the Sand Snakes have their own marquee moment on the way, it won\u2019t be any of the episodes HBO has scheduled through the end of May.)Insurrection is at the heart of Game Of Thrones, but the Faith Militant and The Sons of the Harpy are different kinds of insurrections. They have no connection to the crown, like the campaigns of Daenerys Targaryen, Stannis Baratheon, Robb Stark, or Renly Baratheon\u2014and they don\u2019t appear to be reaching for it, either. And unlike the bloody struggle to remove the Lannisters from the Red Keep, there\u2019s no talk here of moving forward toward a freer, more just Westeros. The sparrows and The Sons of the Harpy want to reverse the clock, to restore societies in which sinners were brutally tortured and humans were bought and sold like chattel. In this way, they\u2019re Game Of Thrones\u2019 first reactionary revolutions.It\u2019s only logical that Cersei would back a movement like the sparrows\u2019. It\u2019s not out of religious faith: It\u2019s out of a selfish need to preserve and restore. As the Lannister line has dwindled, she\u2019s taken drastic measures and made dangerous allies in order to keep whatever power the family has left. Meeting with the High Sparrow, she nearly divulges conduct unbecoming of the sparrows\u2019 rigid ideology. But ideological allies aren\u2019t what Cerssei needs at this point\u2014violent maniacs who\u2019ll arrest Ser Loras are. By sidling up to the fanatics and reinstating the Faith Militant, she might think she\u2019s simultaneously quelling a rebellion, but the wall of black robes that separate King Tommen from the High Sparrow would argue otherwise.She might not know it\u2014because she might not know they exist\u2014but Cersei\u2019s own politics are more in line to those of The Sons of the Harpy. An elite that\u2019s upset about no longer being elite (though they still have plenty of advantages over their former slaves), their rebellion is the type of petulant lashing out the queen mother has outsourced to bloodthirsty zealots. To compensate for a weaker motivation (\u201cWhat do you mean we can\u2019t have slaves?\u201d\u2014The Sons of the Harpy, abridged), they get the better action sequence: Hand-to-hand, street-level combat that has actual stakes because it involves characters whose names we know, like Grey Worm and Ser Barristan. These are emotionally wrenching apples being compared to startling-montage-of-Faith-Militant oranges, but removing Grey Worm\u2019s helmet in that final battle is a move of instantaneous investment. In one expertly choreographed blow, the anonymity of the chaos evaporates. The Sons\u2019 motivations appear petty and unjust because they are petty and unjust, but they appear moreso because of the emphasis \u201cSons Of The Harpy\u201d places on systems of belief and the many definitions of the word \u201cfaith.\u201d A world-building component of other episodes, religion and religious practices factor heavily into this week\u2019s proceedings: There\u2019s the Faith Militant, but there\u2019s also Sansa\u2019s observances at Lyanna\u2019s tomb and Melisandre shining the light of her lord on Jon Snow. Religious beliefs provide comfort and reassurance in desperate times, and the times they are a-desperate in \u201cSons Of The Harpy.\u201d Sansa, promised to another lunatic and living in a home she doesn\u2019t recognize, keeps a flame burning for family members who\u2019ve moved on to the next life. The High Sparrow represents hope for the poor and hungry of King\u2019s Landing\u2014though they may be placing their faith in a figure whose piety is too pious.This is the other type of faith \u201cSons Of The Harpy\u201d deals with, the type Sansa reluctantly places in Littlefinger when he promises that Winterfell will soon be hers. On Game Of Thrones, you can believe in more than gods: You can also believe in people, as Jaime and Bronn do when they charter passage to Dorne. In this case, they choose poorly, because people are less trustworthy than the invisible hands that keep the world spinning. It takes a lifetime to learn if the seven (or the old gods or the Drowned God or the Red God or the Blue God or One God or the Two God) have forsaken you. A person can forsake you overnight.If there\u2019s any coming back from having a person turn their back on you, we\u2019ll soon find out when Jorah Mormont arrives in Meereen with Tyrion Lannister in tow. Ol\u2019 Jorah\u2019s a sight for sore eyes, agreeably crusty and highly confident about the catch he landed in Volantis. Like the introduction of the Sand Snakes, Jorah and Tyrion\u2019s scenes are just a tease of what\u2019s to come, but there\u2019s still good fun to be had in Tyrion\u2019s feelings of captivity leading to an actual incarceration. Just deserts for the most pampered fugitive in the known world: He got out of that wheelhouse, all right\u2014and straight into a stolen boat. It\u2019s quicker passage to Dany\u2019s realm than he was likely to find in Volantis, at least.But what will they find when they dock in Meereen? The skirmish between the Sons and Daenerys\u2019 troops will have dire consequences, especially if Grey Worm and Ser Barristan have suffered mortal wounds. Of \u201cSons Of The Harpy\u201d\u2019s big fights, this is the most comprehensible\u2014Jaime, Bronn, and director Mark Mylod all have difficulty navigating the hilly Dornish landscape\u2014though you can\u2019t count a Game Of Thrones character out unless their head has rolled or someone else says they\u2019re dead. (That said: After the preview for next week\u2019s episode, maybe I\u2019m being overly optimistic here.) But even grave injury could lead to the Khaleesi declaring an all-out offensive on The Sons of the Harpy, so Jorah and Tyrion may be cruising right into a warzone.King\u2019s Landing looks similarly on edge\u2014another parallel season five draws between the capital and the capital of Daenerys\u2019 new world. (The show sure loves its parallels, and it got a doozy of one in Jorah\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m taking you to the queen\u201d last week. We all should\u2019ve known there\u2019s only one queen he recognizes.) But \u201cSons Of The Harpy\u201d aims to distinguish between its brewing revolts, even if we find their actions equally revolting. At least the Faith Militant is serving a power greater than itself\u2014even in its bastardized, sanctimonious way. It commits heinous acts in the names of gods, while The Sons of the Harpy act out of their desire to be treated like gods. The thing about men is that they tend to die; the fallen Sons that we gaze upon at the end of \u201cSons Of The Harpy\u201d can only rise in number in the coming weeks.", "episode_16": "\nThis Game Of Thrones post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Remember: Discussions of things that were different in the books or confirmations of things that won\u2019t happen count as spoilers, too. Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.\u201cWinter is coming\u201d: It\u2019s more than a catchy tagline or a handsome inscription on Stark family heirlooms. It\u2019s a reality in the Game Of Thrones universe. All men must die, time marches ever forward, and the tumultuous summer our characters are experiencing must give way to cold winds and walking corpses. Even when Lord Commander Jon Snow isn\u2019t lecturing his men about winter\u2019s inevitable start, this fact remains in the back of the Game Of Thrones viewer\u2019s mind. It gives the show drive, and it gives the show an urgency\u2014even in a table-setter like \u201cKill The Boy.\u201d Tonight\u2019s episode is one of maps and proposals, of plans and parade formations. In what\u2019s been one of the show\u2019s most deliberately paced seasons, an episode of this type without a sense of urgency would be deadly. But while Game Of Thrones may have all the time in the world, its characters don\u2019t: If Jon Snow fails in persuading the free folk to move south of the wall, the ranks of the White Walkers can only expand. If Daenerys Targaryen doesn\u2019t quell the violence in Meereen, she\u2019ll be a monarch without sujects. If Jorah and Tyrion dawdle along the coast, the Lord of Bear Island may turn to stone before he reaches his destination. (He\u2019s already missed out on another chance to win Dany\u2019s hand, though ignorance of that fact will also put some pep in his step.) The scales up Jorah\u2019s sleeve are the sensational stinger at the end of an understated installment. But they\u2019re also evidence that we should still be paying close attention to Game Of Thrones, even in seemingly insignificant character exchanges. Shireen\u2019s bout with greyscale was the topic of two such scenes in earlier episodes: First the princess and Gilly bonding over their shared experience with the affliction, then Stannis detailing how and why his daughter contracted it in the first place. These are the spoils of serialized television: They don\u2019t always pay off, but when they do, they\u2019re a uniquely satisfying storytelling device. Gilly\u2019s greyscale story gives us context for the snarling, snatching Stone Men who attack Jorah and Tyrion as they sail through the ruins of Valyria; Stannis\u2019 explanation of greyscale\u2019s rapid spread puts stakes in Jorah\u2019s cries of \u201cDon\u2019t let them touch you!\u201d and gives precedence for the patch of rough skin he has up his sleeve. And with that image, a new Game Of Thrones doomsday clock begins counting backward.Such a clock now ticks away for Ramsay, within the womb of Walda Bolton. Developments in Winterfell and at The Wall dominate \u201cKill The Boy,\u201d re-establishing the cruelty and major-player status of the Bastard of Bolton. Dining for the first time with the woman he will soon call wife and the people who\u2019ve only recently recognized him as their son, he pulls a classic (read: horrifying) Ramsay move: Forcing Reek to face Sansa and apologize for the \u201cdeaths\u201d of her two brothers. They\u2019re already aware of one another\u2019s presence: Reek could only hide Theon\u2019s face from the Stark girl for so long, and she ultimately discovers him with \u201cassistance\u201d of Ramsay\u2019s lover Myranda. This is one of those instances where the amount of movement that\u2019s actually occurred within Game Of Thrones is made plain, becuase I\u2019d forgotten that the Greyjoys, not the Boltons, betrayed the Starks first, which is how Theon wound up in Ramsay\u2019s custody in the first place. The volume and frequency of Ramsay\u2019s offenses has more or less patched over Theon\u2019s crimes against his surrogate family.The awkward family dinner\u2014\u201cThat was getting\u2026 very tense\u201d Iwan Rheon says with the comic timing of an actor who spends the off-season ankle deep in Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi\u2019s Vicious venom\u2014presents season five in microcosm. At this point, the conflicting houses are engaging in their own versions of the Bolton\u2019s table-side pissing match, from Cersei\u2019s petty campaign against the Tyrells to Stannis\u2019 military might advancing on Winterfell. They\u2019re posturing, and they\u2019re power moves, and they\u2019re methods of declaring victory before a single body has fallen. By presenting Reek to Sansa and forcing him to make an apology, Ramsay potentially endears himself to his fianc\u00e9e while showing his father the sheer force of his will. The richly deserved irony of it all is that Ramsay\u2019s ability to break the wills of men will matter not if Walda\u2019s carrying a son. That son would be Ramsay\u2019s true successor, the \u201cbetter alternative\u201d to Roose\u2019s fickle acknowledgement of paternity. The announcement of Walda\u2019s pregnancy is an ably deployed killing blow, a surprise on par to Jorah\u2019s sudden need for an exfoliating body scrub. It presents a better sense of Roose as a heel, beyond the treasonous actions and heartless savvy we\u2019ve come to know him by. It must be difficult for Michael McElhatton to establish his character\u2019s sliminess opposite of Rheon: Ramsay\u2019s actions make the character despicable, but the sinister glee Rheon brings to those actions makes him a quintessential villain-you-love-to-hate. Promoted to series regular for season five, McElhatton now has a greater number of opportunities in which Roose can one-up his son, but his methods of torture are strictly intellectual. This is the man who chose his wife on the basis of a \u201cher weight in silver\u201d promise from Walder Frey, and the tiny cuts he gets in during \u201cKill The Boy\u201d establish his thought process. Less flamboyantly barbaric than Ramsay, Roose Bolton is ruthless nonetheless. That concept of the \u201cbetter alternative\u201d is all over \u201cKill The Boy.\u201d Jon and Daenerys each face tough decisions where an easier, more convenient path is presented\u2014only Dany sides with the path of least resistance. Inciting an uprising by merely refusing to open the fighting pits, she faces a situation where justice is a bloody, fiery prospect. Bowing to Meereenese tradition (with her own twist: only free men may fight) and suggesting a marriage to the imprisoned Hizdahr, she presents the flipside of Maester Aemon\u2019s \u201ckill the boy\u201d advice to Jon Snow. As stated at Castle Black, the idiom is one encouraging action over hesitation. In Dany\u2019s situation, it\u2019s about overriding the instinct to prevent action, the defeat of the idealism that got Ser Barristan Selmy killed. And so she prepares to make nice with the people of Meereen, a plan that includes marrying one of the city\u2019s proudest sons. \u201cThankfully, a suitor is already on his knees,\u201d she tells Hizdahr, digging into the sharpest Mother Of Dragons Day gift the writers could\u2019ve given to Emilia Clarke.Jon\u2019s \u201ckill the boy\u201d moment involves the Droopy Dog of the Night\u2019s Watch pursuing his plan to alert and unite the Free Folk. He\u2019ll make no allies deferring entirely to the opinions of Stannis or Tormund\u2014he must command Tormund to address the Free Folk, in addition to accompanying his red-bearded emissary on the journey. These are the choices a leader makes, even if we\u2019re only getting to see the lead-up to and declaration of those choices this week. Sticking by his guns while conceding some ground to Tormund demonstrates Jon\u2019s increasing comfort with his position as lord commander; the rewards and consequences of such will have to wait for another week.He can\u2019t hesitate, because forces greater than any human opposition are forcing his hand. In Valyria, such forces take the zombie-movie-like form of the Stone Men: Attacked by their fellow exiles, Jorah and Tyrion have no time to think before they act. In his first time behind the Game Of Thrones camera, director Jeremy Podeswa stages the scene as \u201cKill The Boy\u201d\u2019s tensest sequence (non-Bolton dinner division), the suspense naturally and automatically heightened by Tyrion\u2019s contraints. The assailants\u2019 craggy hides and inhuman ferocity put them in league with the living dead of Lucio Fulci\u2019s Zombi 2; the underwater photography draws the parallels even tighter, give or take a killer shark. The Stone Men\u2019s attack is preceded by the neatest trick in Tyrion\u2019s guided tour of the Valyrian ruins: After watching Drogon fly overhead (something only Jorah is accustomed to), the camera holds on Peter Dinklage\u2019s face. An indistinct shape stirs in the background, dropping into the water with an attention-grabbing splash. In the immediate wake of Drogon\u2019s majestic flight, it\u2019s a chilling confirmation that something\u2014be it \u201cthe Doom\u201d or not\u2014is amiss in Valyria. It\u2019s something just a little ways ahead of the duo, a threat whose unknown nature puts an otherwise gentle cruise in life-or-death terms.", "episode_15": "\nThis Game Of Thrones post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.\u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\u201d is the type of episode that makes its themes plain: If you\u2019re keeping a running tally of the word \u201clie\u201d (or variations thereof), you\u2019ll get the gist of it pretty quickly. The truth may set you free, but a lie can ensure a longer life in Westeros\u2014even if it\u2019s the truth dressed up like a lie.This is also an episode in which no one thread marks itself as the dominant storyline. Arya and Jaqen H\u2019ghar share the first half of \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\u201d with Tyrion and Jorah, but the episode turns away from these characters at its halfway mark, tending to the other half-dozen narratives that make up season five. Game Of Thrones is a television construction unlike any other, mimicking the deliberate build and intertwining paths of a novel, making episodic chunks out of scenes shot on multiple continents with scores of actors. There has to be some sort of connective tissue to explain why these particular chapters are being told within the same hour, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m always willing to give more leeway to an episode like \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.\u201d It\u2019s blunt in its language, but it might come across as a series of unconnected turning points without that bluntness.Bigger, costlier happenings are in the offing, but \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\u201d advances several season-five stories in intriguing fashion. Arya gains access to the the Faceless Men\u2019s secret chamber, where the towering columns of death masks suggest the assassins\u2019 inventory of disguises. Jaime and Bronn reach Myrcella at the same time as the Sand Snakes\u2014and both wind up apprehended by Dornish guards. Ser Loras\u2019 distinctive birth mark not only deepens his troubles with the Faith Militant, but it winds up contradicting Margaery\u2019s testimony, leading to the incarceration of both Tyrell siblings. And that\u2019s not to mention Tyrion negotiating his way out of death and dismemberment, Littlefinger\u2019s twisty play for Winterfell, or Sansa\u2019s torturous wedding day. It\u2019s an awful lot to sort through, but \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\u201d pulls it all together on strands of honesty and dishonesty.A Game Of Thrones character telling a fib isn\u2019t front page news, but \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\u201d stands out based on the sheer volume of lies told and variety of whom they\u2019re told to. There are lies that save their necks, like the slightly embellished account Tyrion gives of Jorah\u2019s heroic deeds\u2014none of which sink in as deeply as the incredible true story of Mormont Vs. Qotho. There are lies that lead characters to the next step in their journey, as with the comforting words Arya offers to the sick girl in the House of Black and White. There are even lies that go unspoken because their consequences have proven so dire: Theon didn\u2019t kill Bran and Rickon, but pretending like he did kicked off the chain reaction that took him from Prince of Winterfell to House Bolton torture puppet. Coming clean to Sansa would thaw the chill that now exists between the surrogate siblings, but it would also mean reliving a gauntlet of physical and emotional pain. Both types of pain are familiar to the Stark girls; what\u2019s interesting about Arya\u2019s current arc is that it invites her to channel the losses she\u2019s experienced into the experience of complete strangers. There\u2019s still so much about the House of Black and White and the Faceless Men that\u2019s unknown to us, but \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\u201d provides a tantalizing look at their methods. Curious about the corpses she\u2019s shown meticulously cleansing (in ways that are eerily echoed by Sansa\u2019s pre-wedding bath), Arya pushes The Waif for more information. She counters with a story that\u2019s similar to Arya\u2019s: Daughter of a noble, dead mother, mistreatment at the hands of other nobles, assistance from the Faceless Men. Once she\u2019s finished, she puts this question to Arya and the viewers: \u201cWas that true or a lie?\u201d The answer isn\u2019t really important\u2014what\u2019s important is that she told the story so convincingly that it could go either way.But this also exposes the shortcomings of lying as a narrative device, because while it\u2019s one thing to be a Faceless Man, it\u2019s an entirely different thing to be a man of as many faces as Petyr Baelish. Westeros\u2019 ultimate schemer returns to King\u2019s Landing this week to relay information that Cersei finds too good to believe: Sansa Stark is alive, living in Winterfell, and promised to Roose Bolton\u2019s newly legitimized son. As we\u2019re helpfully reminded, Cersei once tasked Littlefinger with locating Arya, so this report is partially meant to compensate for a failure. It\u2019s also setup for the latest Baelish power grab: If the Vale remains loyal to the crown and seizes Winterfell from whatever depleted army wins the pending Baratheon-Bolton bloodbath, Baelish will be named warden of the North. It\u2019s an awfully fragile deal he strikes here, one that seemingly contradicts everything we\u2019ve seen from Littlefinger since the early part of season four. The key to decoding the sequence is in Aidan Gillen\u2019s evasive tone and his character\u2019s non-answer to \u201cI\u2019ll know you\u2019re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark\u2019s head on a spike\u201d\u2014this is pure Baelish trickery, a chess move where a potential vulnerability enables victory after a few more turns. \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\u201d already has him fulfilling one of the promises he makes to the queen mother, as the Lion flies over the entire meeting between Cersei and Baelish.  But it might also be one wrinkle too many, muddying whatever understanding we have of Baelish\u2019s character and what he\u2019s actually trying to get out of all his time in the North. It comes down to The Waif\u2019s question for Arya\u2014\u201cWas that true or a lie?\u201d\u2014and whether we think Baelish is more truthful with Sansa or with Cersei. He\u2019s a shifty guy, and his plan is still in motion, but in the wake of \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken,\u201d it feels like all he has left is shiftiness. When the show leads us to believe he\u2019s lying to everyone, is there any way it can show us which lies actually contain a grain of the truth? Loras\u2019 arrest is a crisis that calls for intervention from Highgarden, resulting in Diana Rigg\u2019s first fifth-season appearance as Olenna Tyrell. Being a Tyrell homer, I cheered the mere appearance of Rigg in previews of \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken,\u201d and she doesn\u2019t disappoint, matching wits with Cersei and announcing her arrival with a new addition to the leather-bound Highgarden Burn Book: \u201cYou can smell the shit from five miles away.\u201d Rigg totally sells the olfactory offense, too.Unfortunately for Westeros\u2019 best grandma, Olenna spends her time in King\u2019s Landing having her face metaphorically shoved in that shit. The High Sparrow\u2019s interrogation of Loras is another \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\u201d lie, a farcical portrayal of justice in which Cersei keeps her hands clean because she\u2019s not the one dragging they Tyrells\u2019 name through the mud\u2014it\u2019s the people she deputized doing the dirty work, people who answer to a higher power than the queen mother. And all the while she gets to play the victim, a transparent pose that gets some fun fake histrionics out of Lena Headey after Margaery is hauled off for perjuring herself in the presence of the seven. Cersei\u2019s feigning surprise while the rest of us get to experience the real thing.Those \u201cwars to come\u201d are starting to look surer by the minute, with the Lannisters betraying multiple alliances during \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.\u201d The Tyrells are seemingly neutralized, but the Martells have the upper hand in Dorne. The collision of Jaime and Bronn\u2019s rescue team and the Sand Snakes\u2019 abduction plans might seem a little too convenient, but the ensuing fight scene is a proportional payoff for efforts that have been brewing in the background all season. Crossing paths in the Water Gardens, the best warriors from their respective lands square off in a kinetic action sequence, the Sands\u2019 varied arsenal bringing some novelty to Game Of Thrones\u2019 battle vocabulary. When Nym attempts to make off with Myrcella, the sequence almost collapses into an \u201cOur princess is in another castle\u201d anticlimax\u2014thank goodness for the intervention of Areo Hotah and the Dornish guard.The fight highlights one of \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\u201d\u2019s most admirable qualities: There\u2019s a sense of newness about the episode that Game Of Thrones can\u2019t always muster on a weekly basis. We know the major players and the major settings so well now that some of the best parts of season five harken back to the surprise and seemingly endless possibilities of the show\u2019s early years. The epic scale of the show is tied up in its sense of undiscovered lands, and these episodes have delivered on that front, like the glimpses of Dorne they\u2019ve afforded or last week\u2019s cruise through the Valyrian ruins. The chamber beneath the House of Black and White expands our knowledge of this world while retaining some mystery. The set is a feat of production design, massive in scale and simultaneously alien yet familiar. The way the scene is lit, the columns may as well reach to the sky; it\u2019s a space that dwarfs both Maisie Williams and Tom Wlaschia, all the better to suggest all the different people a girl can be once she becomes no one. No matter what she may have told herself before\u2014be it the truth or a lie\u2014these faces are the reason Arya has been cleaning floors and cadavers.   One of \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\u201d\u2019s most vibrant images is also its most tragic: Sansa, looking every bit the prisoner and the bride. With her hair restored to its natural color and the gothic tones of her Vale disguise traded for wedding whites, it stands to reason that this is Sansa playing a part, that the strength she gained since leaving King\u2019s Landing hasn\u2019t melted away in the intense heat of Ramsay\u2019s madness or Myranda\u2019s envy. She demonstrates as much, refusing to take Theon by the arm as he escorts her to the the Godswood. There\u2019s an impressive show of strength from Theon later in the sequence, when he represents himself by name and status during the wedding ceremony, reclaiming some part of the self he lost to Ramsay at the Dreadfort. Unfortunately for Sansa and Theon, Ramsay\u2019s still around to rob them of whatever strength they manage to muster, going to particularly despicable ends to do so at the end of \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.\u201d It\u2019s a deeply unpleasant scene, centering on the biggest lie that\u2019s told throughout the episode: The spartan \u201cDo you take this man?\u201d/\u201cDo you take this woman?\u201d wedding vows between Sansa and the Bastard of Bolton (still an apt sobriquet). On their marriage bed, Ramsay forcibly consummates the union, making Theon watch as he does so. It\u2019s a rape depicted only through audio, director Jeremy Podeswa sparing us the visual for slow zooms in on Sophie Turner\u2019s and Alfie Allen\u2019s faces.Game Of Thrones has whiffed with this type of development in the past, failing to treat an established reality within its universe with the proper amount of gravity. In the episode\u2019s one majorly sour note, \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken,\u201d swings too far in the opposite direction, as the ominous score, the characters\u2019 reactions, and the involvement of Ramsay all scream \u201cGame Of Thrones does not endorse sexual assault!\u201d Here\u2019s an example in which bluntness was the incorrect tactic, deployed largely to demonstrate to Sansa what a horrible dude she\u2019s married. Whether or not this was a complete misstep will depend on whether or not the rape has repercussions on anything deeper than a story level\u2014something that, as Myles points out in the experts review, Game Of Thrones isn\u2019t equipped to handle, on account of how many characters and stories are being dealt with each episode. I\u2019d like to think the people who make the show have learned from past mistakes with Daenerys and Cersei, but I could just be lying to myself.", "episode_14": "\nThis Game Of Thrones post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.Power is the prize promised to the game of thrones\u2019 ultimate victor. The power to rule, the power to define right from wrong, the power to mold the known world in your image. No matter how they may protest, nor matter what they may say otherwise, this is a motivating factor for any prospective Game Of Thrones royalty.Power is a prize that\u2019s won at the end of the game; survival is a gift given during its every turn. The gift of another chance, the gift of seeing your loved ones again, the gift of outlasting your enemies. Pain, suffering, and death are all givens for these characters, making life, and the living of that life, all the more precious. In \u201cThe Gift,\u201d The High Sparrow speaks of the seven heavens that await the virtuous in the afterlife, but even he can\u2019t speak from a place of authority on that subject. To pick yourself up out of the morass and live another day is a real and tangible reward, one \u201cThe Gift\u201d believes in wholeheartedly. If it didn\u2019t, what would be the point of coming back to this fucked-up dragon world week-in and week-out?We keep coming back because of the survivors. Partially because the only characters you can recognize in season five are those who\u2019ve made it through the preceding four seasons, but also because the endurance of Sansa, Brienne, Sam, Gilly, Dany, Jorah, and Tyrion suggest better things for a Westerosi future. Game Of Thrones doesn\u2019t necessarily believe that good is destined to triumph over evil\u2014or even believe in the existence of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d in the abstract\u2014but it is powered by the triumph of the spirit. No matter what cruelty Sansa faces within the walls of Winterfell, no matter the setbacks Jorah confronts on the road to Meereen, each keeps pushing on. (\u201cWe march to victory, or we march to defeat,\u201d surviving Baratheon brother Stannis says in \u201cThe Gift.\u201d \u201cBut we go forward, only forward.\u201d) They keep the candles burning, even when someone\u2019s trying to snuff them out.  \u201cThe Gift\u201d features a gorgeous transition to that effect, fading from an unlit window (monitored from afar by Brienne) to the flames illuminating Maester Aemon\u2019s final moments. There\u2019s a hopelessness to the Winterfell scenes this week, similar to that felt during season three\u2019s stay at the Dreadfort\u2014Ramsay\u2019s unrelenting sadism just has that effect, I suppose. Director Miguel Sapochnik even frames Theon\u2019s journey from Sansa\u2019s chambers as a classic Bolton bait-and-switch, implying a trip to the Broken Tower that actually leads to Ramsay\u2019s door. It\u2019s a shocker, albeit an inevitable one: Reek was never going to turn on his master so quickly. Hopelessness, in this instance, is more a case of getting your hopes up too high.And yet, the darkening conditions under Bolton rule are given some light by Sansa\u2019s faith that her torture marriage to Ramsay is merely a temporary arrangement. She has Littlefinger\u2019s word that the Boltons are not long for Winterfell, and after some time under his tutelage, she also has his ability for playing all the angles against her enemies. Verbally sparring with her husband, Sansa reminds him that the only thing making him Roose\u2019s true son and Winterfell\u2019s heir is the word of yet another bastard\u2014Tommen Baratheon. He breaks down her defenses with the flayed display of the Starks\u2019 friend in the North, but that\u2019s only after Sansa surreptitiously swipes some sort of pointy-looking implement from among the Bolton arms. When she makes the theft, she\u2019s yet to learn that she\u2019s lost an ally, but even then, she\u2019s thinking that the fight for survival is one she\u2019ll have to wage on her own. That adds a neatly ironic twist to Ramsay gloating that \u201cOur people are used to fighting in frost.\u201d In \u201cThe Gift,\u201d surviving in the north means surviving in isolation. While Sansa loses one accomplice and is betrayed by another, Samwell Tarly remains at Castle Black while one friend rides into enemy territory and another wades into oblivion. Jon Snow\u2019s sympathy for the Wildlings made it hard enough for Sam, Gilly, and li\u2019l Sam, and the Lord Commander\u2019s diplomatic trot with Tormund Giantsbane isn\u2019t making things any easier. (The campaign remains unpopular, Alliser Thorne reminds us, as spoken updates on Jon\u2019s popularity are one of the First Ranger\u2019s main duties.) Maester Aemon\u2019s death sets them further adrift, as the old man\u2019s funeral is barely a memory before two crows make unwanted advances on Gilly, only to be frightened off by the combined forces of Sam The Slayer and Ghost the direwolf.Here, as in Winterfell, there\u2019s a \u201cdarkest before the dawn\u201d sensation. The Night\u2019s Watch barely sticks to its oath when its leaders are present, and the removal of Jon and Aemon leads directly to this scene of lawlessness within the walls of Castle Black. Survival here is a matter of self-determination, Sam and Gilly taking their licks from brothers Rat Stache and Five O\u2019Clock Shadow but not backing down. Ghost scares the goons away, but he has the time to make it to the mess hall because Sam and Gilly held their attackers off. So thrilling is the rush of survival that the couple immediately sets about breaking one part of Sam\u2019s oath. They need all the allies they can get, so they may as well make one, biologically speaking. The plainest statement on survival comes from the sequence that gives \u201cThe Gift\u201d its name: Jorah and Tyrion, having successfully negotiated themselves to the fighting pits, stand among several slain warriors and declare themselves to Daenerys. Jorah\u2019s fellow fighters clumsily bludgeon each other to death, delighting the spectators, disgusting the queen, and disappointing the pit master. But the masked man who emerges from the gates mid-melee fights with skill and confidence. He fells opponents with non-fatal blows, using their own limbs and armor against them. In an arena that favors blunt force, Jorah is artful in his survival. Where the preceding violence is jump-cut brutality, his entry into the fracas plays out in relatively long, relatively smooth takes. His professionalism even halts an early exit by noted fan of professional warriors Daenerys Stormborn.Victory in the pit and a dramatic unmasking make a fitting end to Jorah and Tyrion\u2019s season-five picaresque. Weathering the sea, the stone men, slavers, and each other, the duo clears one last hurdle to stand before the queen. It\u2019s convenient that all three should wind up at the very same fighting pit, but we\u2019re at episode seven (and episode nine will almost certainly depict the battle between Stannis\u2019 frostbitten forces and the Bolton army), so D.B. Weiss and David Benioff are working with limited storytelling real estate here. \u201cThe Gift\u201d wraps its Meereen section before Jorah can explain what he means to achieve, but we already got his address about redemption a few episodes back. Once more, the demands of serialized storytelling must be paid heed, so the scene ends on one of those quintessential Game Of Thrones cliffhangers, in which one character drops some sort of bombshell (\u201cMy name is Tyrion Lannister\u201d) and the camera does a slow, soap-opera zoom on the assembled players. Ramin Djawadi brings the score to a crescendo, the actors do their best take on \u201cThe Californians\u201d (\u201cTyri-ahn? Whad\u2019re you doing here?\u201d\u2014Emilia Clarke\u2019s face), and we wait for things to pick back up next week. There\u2019s no visual reminder of the infection that\u2019s slowly turning Jorah\u2019s arm into a scaly stalagmite this week, but internally, that gives the character one more reason to meet with Dany ASAP. Swords can be shielded against, servitude can be talked around, but greyscale could be the only opponent Jorah doesn\u2019t survive. And so he gives himself the gift of being in his khaleesi\u2019s presence, knowing that such things are not granted. It\u2019s unclear what he and Tyrion will get out of their trip to Meereen, but in bringing Dany something she can use to win the game, Jorah himself is rewarded. On the \u201cWe go forward, only forward\u201d front, there\u2019s also a major development in the Red Keep: On the word of Brother Lancel, Cersei is locked up by the Faith Militant. In one of the most cathartic moments in Game Of Thrones\u2019 history, an episode that finds Cersei rubbing her freedom in Margaery\u2019s face ends with the Mother of Madness\u2019 own face being blocked from view by a cell door. This is the comeuppance she\u2019s been bucking for since the beginning of the series, a defeat more profoundly felt than the deaths of Tywin, Joffrey, or Robert because the misfortune is befalling her directly. Prior to this, the biggest defeat we\u2019ve seen Cersei suffer involved the loss of her title\u2014but even then, she retained the power and the control of queendom. Not even Margaery Tyrell could lay Cersei this low\u2014it took a shoeless man in rags to pull off that feat.Like Theon betraying Sansa, it was only a matter of time before the Faith Militant scheme backfired on Cersei. An army of fanatics has been granted unchecked and unrestrained authority, but to hear the High Sparrow tell it, it almost sounds like a positive for Westeros. His meeting with Lady Olenna is one of those instances when Game Of Thrones boldly refuses to paint in black and white: It begins by playing on our sympathies for the Tyrells, but ends with those sympathies in question. The High Sparrow is busy at work dismantling sword-and-sorcery conventions, pointing out that the protagonists of this show are, by-and-large, nobles disconnected from the struggles of the common folk. \u201cYou are the few and we are the many,\u201d he reminds Olenna, putting him in a position that represents the vast majority of Game Of Thrones viewers.It\u2019s a fascinating scene, for reasons beyond pitting Emma Peel against Sam Lowry in a battle of wits. While the High Sparrow retains his air of eccentricity, he shows he\u2019s as cunning as anyone in King\u2019s Landing\u2014a city that could eventually fall under his rule. (Not that he\u2019d ever consider himself a ruler.) He\u2019s already outfoxed the queen mother, and now his sights are set on working his way around the team that toppled a king. They\u2019re working toward similar goals, if not for the same reasons. The Baelish-Olenna conspiracy unseated Joffrey; the High Sparrow would unseat every Lannister, every Tyrell, probably every Stark, too.The Faith strikes at a moment when the crown is particularly weakened. Like their rivals in the North, the members of the royal family are scattered and isolated: Cersei\u2019s arrest leaves Tommen entirely on his own, with Jaime stuck in Dorne with Myrcella, who shows no interest in returning to her homeland. The great houses of the Seven Kingdoms are in disarray, making conditions all the more suitable for a populist uprising. They have no poisoned blades at their disposal, but the Faith Militant poses a greater threat to the Lannisters than a hundred Sand Snakes. But even the Sand Snakes are neutralized this week, behind bars like so many of the show\u2019s main characters. Talk about having something to survive: In nearly every one of \u201cThe Gift\u201d\u2019s storylines, there\u2019s someone incarcerated, in captivity, in chains, or incapacitated by the weather. \u201cThe Gift\u201d packs a remarkable amount of plot movement for an episode in which so many characters can\u2019t move. The weather\u2019s getting worse, the wind whipping the snow around The Wall and Winterfell in ways that foreshadow Stannis\u2019 frozen forces. Melisandre suggests that her king can reverse his misfortune and being laying his path to the Iron Throne if only he spilled his daughter\u2019s blood. But that\u2019s not a sacrifice he\u2019s prepared to make. Survival is a gift, but being someone\u2019s survivor can be a tragedy.", "episode_31": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of        view  of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.\nLook, I know last week was the Red Wedding, and after all that carnage and misery, it may seem that Game Of Thrones can never top itself again. Season one ended with Daenerys giving birth to her dragons. Season two ended with an army of white walkers. How do you match that, especially with the shockwaves of episode nine still reverberating through the internet? With that in mind, season three basically ended with, well, lots of people getting to where they\u2019ve been plodding all year!\nJaime\u2019s back in King\u2019s Landing, lacking a paw but making cute eyes at Cersei. We know he\u2019s a changed man, but can he stay that way now that he\u2019s safely ensconced in the capital again, likely in Cersei\u2019s warm grasp and under the cold eye of daddy Tywin? Will Brienne be able to exert her influence, or will she even be allowed in the court, considering she was an ally of Renly and then Catelyn\u2019s? So many questions! We have no answers, only the briefest glimpse of Jaime in the closing minutes of the show.\nA lot of \u201cMysha\u201d went that way. A show that usually excises some of its characters from each episode just for storytelling purposes had to check in with every one of them, setting up the next season and giving us plenty to look forward to. But at the same time, it didn\u2019t give us quite as much to just sit back and enjoy\u2014the episode lacked a lot of serious plot movement or major twists and may have fans gnashing their teeth a little bit as they wait nine months for season four. The previous season finales have also had that quality, but they each ended on a barnstorming note. \u201cMysha,\u201d not quite so much.\nThat\u2019s not to say that the closing scene wasn\u2019t lovely in its own regard. Daenerys liberates the people of Yunkai with nary a sword swung (although there was a fair bit of that last week), telling them to claim their own freedom and being greeted as \u201cMysha,\u201d or \u201cmother,\u201d by a cavalcade of slaves who hold her aloft in a moving bit of crowdsurfing. It is to Game Of Thrones\u2019 credit that this is the only time we see Daenerys in the episode, but the moment still works, because of what we\u2019ve seen over the season.\nSo Jaime\u2019s in King\u2019s Landing, and Daenerys is in Yunkai, having freed the slaves. Jon is back at Castle Black for the first time since season one, along with a relieved Sam and Gilly. Stannis is making a move in that direction too. Bran is finally beyond the Wall. Arya, sadly, made it to Riverrun but has little to show for it except more mental trauma and an impulse control problem that\u2019s only getting worse. We\u2019ll cover all that in a second.\nThe immediate aftermath of the Red Wedding is difficult to watch. The carnage at the Stark camp is bad enough, but grisly details like the head of Robb\u2019s wolf being sewn to his body? Man, George R. R. Martin, that is fucked up. It\u2019s the appropriate backdrop for the Hound to have another heroic moment\u2014he only really shines through at the darkest of times, when any humane action sticks out, even if it\u2019s just him grimly riding through the chaos to protect Arya.\nWhat to make of Arya\u2019s vengeance on the Frey lackeys, stabbing one mercilessly as he boasts of his work desecrating Robb\u2019s corpse? On the one hand, you give \u2018em hell, Arya. On the other hand, it\u2019s a bleak moment, meant to signify how far past rock bottom she\u2019s gone with no family left to turn to. Even the Hound is surprised (mostly that she managed to spirit a knife away from him), but what\u2019s really unsettling to watch is the little act she tries out before killing her prey, distracting him with a lost-little-girl routine that includes a dropped coin for misdirect and everything. It\u2019s creepy stuff, but what of Arya next year? Does she just become the Hound\u2019s murdering chum?\nSansa\u2019s misery is more conventional (she\u2019s more conventional after all) but also pretty tough to stomach, especially after her and Tyrion have a cute little moment at the top of the hour taking comfort in their shared outcast statuses. Tyrion\u2019s relationship with her is one of the most unambiguous in the show\u2014he wants to protect her, nothing more, but he\u2019s doomed to let her down forever just by being a Lannister. There\u2019s nothing he can do about that.\nStill, it\u2019s great to see him stick up for her at the small council meeting, which doubled as the funniest scene of the year\u2014blackly funny, for sure, but funny nonetheless. In fact, this whole episode was quite funny, with some moments (like Balon and Yara inspecting Theon\u2019s dick in a box) that had me laughing when they really shouldn\u2019t have. It\u2019s not like the content of the episode was any lighter\u2014if anything, it was darker. But after the misery of last week, I was glad for the arch tone.\nTywin et al dealing with Joffrey\u2019s awful glee was another great example. Joffrey plans to have Robb\u2019s head delivered and served to Sansa at her wedding, a spectacularly evil bit of thinking even for him. Tyrion is outraged, but even Cersei and Tywin won\u2019t hear of it, and if Joffrey\u2019s utter lack of power has not already been underlined, Tywin\u2019s frank conversation with his son afterward (\u201cYou just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a fool if you think he\u2019s the most powerful man in Westeros\u201d) makes it perfectly clear. I always find these scenes thrilling to watch, because it\u2019s just great to see Tywin speaking candidly, but as usual it devolves into making Tyrion feel miserable and unloved. Tywin says he resisted the urge to cast him into the sea, which makes him a good father, and with that, we add another chapter to the book \u201cEpically Bad Parenting: The Lannister Way.\u201d\nAnother bad parent? Roose Bolton. As I had guessed (and the show made painfully obvious) Theon\u2019s torturer is also one of the Boltons, his bastard son Ramsay, who even the ice-blooded Roose will admit is not the most compassionate soul. Watching the steely Roose and the pantomime villain Walder Frey clean up after the Red Wedding was a joyous bit of boo-hiss villainy, but I still find it tough to stomach Ramsay\u2019s cartoonish antics, even if sending Theon\u2019s junk to Pyke was a devilishly cruel twist. Now Theon is called \u201cReek\u201d and his spirit has been truly broken. Great. Can he come off the cross now? I\u2019d like this storyline to go somewhere.\nThis is a show that generally likes to keep its characters apart, but I liked Bran and Sam running into each other and delighting in their shared memories of Jon, before separating\u2014Sam goes back to the Wall where he belongs, safe with Maester Aemon writing letters, while Bran, Jojen, Meera, and Hodor march into the great unknown, believing themselves the only ones able to stop the white walkers. It\u2019s an exciting notion, but there\u2019s clearly miles to go in that storyline, so it\u2019s hard to greet it with anything more than a cheerful shrug.\nI\u2019m much more excited for Stannis\u2019 next move, also aimed at the white walkers. For most of the episode, he\u2019s plotting to burn Gendry alive as a sacrifice to the gods, pointing to Robb\u2019s death as evidence of Melisandre\u2019s witchery, but Davos (more and more the beating, honorable heart of the show, filling a void left by Ned) rescues the boy and manages to convince Stannis and Melisandre to cast their gaze north instead. The turnaround on this is \u2026 quick indeed. Davos is seconds from death, and two minutes later he\u2019s right at Stannis\u2019 side for the big push to the Wall. I assume this is a little less rushed in the books, but I\u2019m willing to forgive it if it gets Stannis out of Dragonstone and back into the thick of things. He\u2019s been licking his wounds too long, and with Robb out of the fight, the war is pretty much over. Time to play the long game, am I right?\nGame Of Thrones is very much about the long game. We\u2019re ending in the middle of a book, for crying out loud, and it\u2019s not going to mess with that just to give us some fancy shocking ending. I, for one, can live with that. I\u2019ll sit and bide my time and wait patiently for the next season to come, many months from now, with baited breath, as I always do. And so will all of you. Oh sure, we may complain that Daenerys\u2019 dragons haven\u2019t eaten Joffrey\u2019s head yet, or that the white walkers seem to be moving south awfully slowly, but that\u2019s fine. Crazy things will happen and we\u2019re going to enjoy the heck out of them. We just have to kill time until then.\n", "episode_30": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.From one perspective, the one Tywin Lannister would have us subscribe to, \u201cTwo Swords\u201d is the first look at a Westeros under Lannister rule. As far as the Hand is concerned, all challengers to the Iron Throne are defeated or in the grave: Stannis Baratheon was soundly defeated all that time ago at Blackwater, and the last known remnant of House Stark has been married away to his least favorite son. And with the weddings of Joffrey and Cersei on the horizon, power is all but consolidated under the banner of the lion. \u201cPeace\u201d is the watchword of\u00a0\u201cTwo Swords,\u201d\u00a0and the characters at King\u2019s Landing are insistent about establishing an air of harmony and tranquility, as sunny as those shores whose water is no longer glowing an unearthly shade of chartreuse.But that\u2019s one of the great things about Game Of Thrones\u2019 far-flung characters and multiple POVs\u2014we don\u2019t have to believe everything Charles Dance tells us. Because if this world truly was at peace, then George R.R. Martin could keep lounging about in his velvet-lined Grotto of Not Writing, as the TV show would be over and the author wouldn\u2019t have to worry about churning out additional literary source material. In truth, unrest persists in Westeros, just as it persists within Tywin\u2019s own family. With the aftershocks of the Red Wedding still reverberating, the Tyrells consigned to subplot, and the Baratheons (legitimate Baratheons, at least) nowhere to be seen, the Lannisters get to be this week\u2019s spotlight Game Of Thrones soap opera\u2014and it\u2019s fucking delicious. \u201cTwo Swords\u201d sets the stage for the season to come, so it\u2019s necessarily talky\u2014but when that talk involves two members of House Lannister, it\u2019s compelling on a sniping, intimate level that suggests there\u2019s a great family drama called Always Pays His Debts pounding away within Game Of Thrones.In this time of \u201cpeace,\u201d enemies amass within and without King\u2019s Landing, but a Lannister\u2019s most dangerous adversary is another Lannister. Tywin and Joffrey appear to be the only members of the family who are on good terms right now, but we don\u2019t even see them interact this week; otherwise, there\u2019s a lot of disagreement and withering sarcasm and cheap shots at Jaime\u2019s missing hand. Cersei\u2019s half in the goblet when her brother-lover pays her a call (and who wouldn\u2019t be, given her current situation?), and there\u2019s a sense that as juicy and entertaining as anything involving a Lannister is this week, it\u2019d be even more juicy and entertaining if they were all this drunk. Technically, the king and his hand (that has to sting every time Jaime hears it) are drunk with power, but \u201cTwo Swords\u201d awoke in me a previously unknown desire to see a Game of Thrones version of Girls\u2019 \u201cBeach House,\u201d in which Dance, Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, and Jack Gleeson decamp to some seaside Lannister retreat, raid the wine cellar, and bitch about all of the various ways they\u2019ve disappointed one another. (Of course, that can\u2019t happen, because there\u2019s no way that weekend ends without Tywin poisoning the lot of \u2019em.)With a script by showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the season premiere splits itself pretty evenly among the realm overseen by Benioff and Weiss\u2014yet it still feels like a Lannister-centric hour. That might have to do with how the impact of its many checkpoints is felt most acutely by Jaime and Tyrion. They\u2019re each dealing with a new status quo, neither of which they decided for themselves: Jaime\u2019s status within his father\u2019s army and his relationship with his sister were altered while he was away; Tyrion, meanwhile, struggles to keep Sansa from feeling like a prisoner while failing to acknowledge the painful bit of captivity his true love, Shae, is railing against. Season three was the year that Coster-Waldau truly came into his own as Jaime, and that sense of vulnerability and world weariness carries over to his scenes here. Now that they\u2019re in the same space again, it\u2019s fascinating to see how Jaime and Tyrion have almost become equals in the eyes of their father and their kingdom. I hope they get to share some moments of wounded cynicism together later in the season.Not every character gets a compelling catch-up, but the world of the show has grown so large that many of the major players can\u2019t get more than five minutes of screentime. And that world continues to grow as the people of Dorne arrive for the royal wedding\u2014their main emissaries in \u201cTwo Swords\u201d being Oberyn Martell and his paramour, Ellaria. Oberyn\u2019s vendetta against the Lannisters (an Inigo Montoya vibe given a nice, psychotic edge by Pedro Pascal) gives him a decent point of integration in his scene opposite Tyrion. Less elegant is the sexposition Oberyn and Ellaria engage in under Littlefinger\u2019s roof, which answers the Martells\u2019 bloodlust with their lascivious appetites\u2014but four seasons into Game Of Thrones, is it really a surprise that anyone in Westeros has lascivious appetites?\u00a0Excess and lack of self-control is better explored in the way certain reliable symbols of the Game Of Thrones universe are starting to break down. In Daenerys\u2019 first scene of the season, she\u2019s reminded that dragons cannot be tamed\u2014\u201cnot even by their mother.\u201d And it turns out the oath of The Night\u2019s Watch isn\u2019t as sacrosanct as Jon Snow was lead to believe, as the men weighing his traitorous offenses among the Free Folk basically scoff away the whole\u00a0\u201cchastity\u201d deal.\u00a0\u201cYou know nothing, Jon Snow,\u201d indeed.And then there are the\u00a0\u201cTwo Swords\u201d of the title, which ostensibly refers to the pair of blades Tywin\u2019s smiths forge from Ice, the Valyrian steel beauty that was both Ned Stark\u2019s most trusted weapon and the sword that took his head. The whole mythology surrounding Valyrian steel is that it\u2019s basically indestructible, and only the most experienced weaponmakers can rework. Right off the bat, season four sends the viewer a signal: Forget the Westeros you knew. Forget where on the board you\u2019ve mentally placed any of Game Of Thrones\u2019 chess pieces. It\u2019s not a reboot, but\u00a0\u201cTwo Swords\u201d is\u00a0a starting place that feels distinct from where\u00a0\u201cMhysa\u201d left off. Fortunes have risen and fallen while we were away, and the awful power of King Joffrey seeps deeply into the Seven Kingdoms.\u00a0What we have taken for granted about Game Of Thrones may have changed, but\u00a0\u201cTwo Swords\u201d also ends on a circular note: Arya Stark, in possession of Needle once more, exacting vengeance for Lommy and crossing one of the names off of her\u00a0\u201cprayer\u201d list. From one perspective,\u00a0\u201cTwo Swords\u201d and the weapons it describes belong to the Lannisters. From another, the episode is bookended by scenes about two swords belonging to the Starks. If we want to go even deeper into the significance of the title, it\u00a0could refer to Needle and the executioner\u2019s\u00a0sword avoided by Jon Snow (for the time being). From that angle,\u00a0\u201cTwo Swords\u201d stealthily belongs to the Starks\u2014who are down, but not out.\u00a0That\u2019s an enticingly rich way to begin a season.", "episode_19": "\nThis Game Of Thrones post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.Prophecies and predictions are the rare storytelling tool sharpened by lack of specificity. Ambiguous details about true intentions and dark secrets can only fail to live up to an audience\u2019s wildest imaginings, but a future like the one foretold at the top of Game Of Thrones\u2019 fifth season opens itself up to myriad connections through circular language. The witch\u2019s words are explicit in spots\u2014\u201cThe king will have 20 children, and you will have three\u201d refers to Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella\u2019s, er, \u201cunorthodox\u201d paternity\u2014but leave room for interpretation in others. Considering the chilly glances and private insults volleyed between the houses of Lannister and Tyrell in \u201cThe Wars To Come,\u201d the warning of \u201canother\u201d queen who would usurp Cersei draws a direct line to Margaery. But such a connection ignores a truer successor, the one with dragons and infinite infantry who looks a lot more like Cersei in season five\u2019s second week. There\u2019s a bonus thrill in realizing that the witch was also referring to Daenerys Targaryen, who, like the Mother of Madness, was also born to be royalty.As they order beheadings and preside over tense council meetings this week, Cersei and Dany are presented as two sides of the same iron coin. Their motivations differ, but each winds up exemplifying Game Of Thrones\u2019 own warnings about power. With her father dead, her non-condemned brother on a mission (of her devising), and her son ill-equipped to reign over any subject who isn\u2019t Ser Pounce, Cersei rearranges the Small Council to her advantage in \u201cThe House Of Black And White.\u201d Lena Headey strides into the chamber on a cloud of imperious confidence, settles into the Hand\u2019s chair like it was built especially for her, and slyly reshuffles the Seven Kingdoms\u2019 deck. She continues lashing out at the witch\u2019s prophecy, building a wall of alliances between her last living son and his promised golden shroud.That scene gives an elementary treatment to one of the series\u2019 primary themes, but without absolute power corrupting absolutely, Tyrion and Varys would be riding to Meereen without reason. And without that perspective, they\u2019d find an uninteresting-and-idealized version of their new champion. Backed into a corner by the strengths of her convictions and the realities of justice, Daenerys oversees a city on the brink. Attempting to exercise the type of compromise that was recommended to her last week, she makes a grim pronouncement: Mossador must die. His \u201cKILL THE MASTERS\u201d retaliation may have been just\u2014the man took the life of an Unsullied, after all\u2014but it also skirted the sense of justice Dany wants to instill in Meereen. This too was foreshadowed in \u201cThe Wars To Come\u201d: It\u2019s Mossador\u2019s tragic comeuppance for delighting at the line \u201cAngry snakes lash out\u2014makes chopping off their heads that much easier.\u201dIt\u2019s a turning point for Dany\u2019s time in Meereen, if not a turning point for the character overall. She makes a difficult decision, and witnesses the immediate (and bloody) public objection to that decision. It\u2019s a polarizing decision, illustrated by one half of the assembled crowd immediately turning hostile and clashing with the other half of the crowd. \u201cThe House Of Black And White\u201d traffics in these sort of right-down-the-middle splits and symmetrical compositions\u2014freed slaves and their former masters, the contrasting doors of the titular structure, Dany\u2019s white gown and Cersei\u2019s black robes\u2014but puts its characters through paces of greater complexity. The prophecy Cersei is futilely swatting away is shaded in gray, and the wrinkles of Mossador\u2019s crime go beyond the \u201cslavers bad, slaves good\u201d stance that took Dany to the top of the great pyramid. Even being a mother is no longer as uncomplicated as it once was: Boy kings require Small Council puppet-mastering; just because Drogon comes back to the nest, it doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s going to stand by Dany or obey her. (The dragons are in full-on teen mode this season, aren\u2019t they? \u201cEw, gross mom: Don\u2019t touch me. Everybody\u2019s looking!\u201d) Pushing the woman who was queen and the woman who would be queen toward (or away from) those conclusions is where \u201cThe House Of Black And White\u201d finds its narrative verve. They\u2019ll soon be joined in the Westerosi Leaders\u2019 Club by Jon Snow, who almost earns an escape from Castle Black this week. But that\u2019s before he\u2019s lifted into the position of Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch on the strength of a last-minute write-in campaign. Once more, destiny is at play here, but I can\u2019t be the only one who was hoping Jon would take the other position offered to him in this episode. Concurring with my esteemed colleagues Katie Rife and John Teti, I find a growing tediousness to scenes set among the Night\u2019s Watch, one that might be alleviated by Jon\u2019s installment as its leader. The same tensions will be at play\u2014the old guard won\u2019t want to follow the new guard\u2019s sensitive, brooding, and merciful style of leadership\u2014but here\u2019s hoping Jon\u2019s experience north of The Wall will get this portion of the Game Of Thrones ensemble off the damn Wall with greater frequency.Because Tyrion\u2019s correct to complain about being stuck in another traveling box: There\u2019s a whole new world to see beyond the established locations glimpsed in \u201cThe House Of Black And White.\u201d The episode does some intriguing work with longstanding members of the cast, but its most exciting scenes\u2014beyond the very \u201cspeeder bikes on Endor\u201d horse chase involving Littlefinger\u2019s men, Brienne, and Pod\u2014are those set in the courts of Dorne and on the streets of Braavos. Fortunately, more scenes like this are on there way, because a) Jaime and Bronn are sailing to Dorne, b) Arya gains access to The House Of Black And White at the end of the episode, and c) Dr. Julian Bashir doesn\u2019t beam down from Deep Space 9 for a single tense exchange with Ellaria Sand. But each time \u201cThe House Of Black And White\u201d cuts away from Arya or Doran, it\u2019s a tiny disappointment.But these scenes, like the witch\u2019s prophecy, are meant to tease\u2014in ways that intrigue as well as taunt. Appropriate for the group that operates out of The House Of Black And White, the building and this storyline form one big question mark, a mystery for Arya to solve as she determines her life\u2019s next course. There\u2019s a hint of Scooby-Doo in Jaqen H\u2019gar\u2019s re-appearance, but it\u2019s a shock nonetheless, its sense of surprise amplified by the utter uncertainty of Arya\u2019s journey to Braavos. She knows only to the show the coin to a Braavosi and say \u201cvalar morghulis,\u201d but neither she nor we know what that\u2019s going to get her. Requesting the true identity of her red-headed champion, he says he is \u201cNo one, and that is who a girl must become.\u201d Shedding a little more light on his idiosyncratic speech patterns, he opens the black door, Ramin Djawadi\u2019s score crescendos, Arya sees an interior that the viewers can\u2019t see, and destiny and ambiguity score one more \u201cThe House Of Black And White\u201d victory.", "episode_18": "\nThis Game Of Thrones post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our experts reviews are for.Game Of Thrones takes place in a world that\u2019s probably centuries away from any sort of global communications (or even a non-avian postal system), but news, information, and legends still manage to travel between the Seven Kingdoms. They can be carried by a raven, like Cersei\u2019s summons for Littlefinger in \u201cHigh Sparrow.\u201d They can travel in stories told to one listener (like Pod learning the origin story of Brienne\u2019s affections for Renly) or many (the red priestess of Volantis preaching the good word of Daenerys). Devices like these help bring Westeros and the world beyond it down to an understandable scale. They also lend plausibility to the idea of Essosi johns wanting to spend a night with the Mother of Dragons\u2014or a facsimile thereof. The common folk of Game Of Thrones \u201cknow\u201d the series\u2019 main characters with a familiarity that we might treat our own public figures. It\u2019s an elementary analogy\u2014they\u2019re politicians, celebrities, and icons in their own right\u2014but one that \u201cHigh Sparrow\u201d uses to great effect. Hear the crowds chanting \u201cWe love you Queen Margaery!\u201d during the procession to the royal wedding. Heed Varys\u2019 warning that Tyrion will be recognized, even in Volantis. Consider the value the episode and its characters place on something as fickle and arbitrary as a surname.After meditating on leadership and power in season five\u2019s first two episodes, Game Of Thrones turns to the most down-to-earth of its thematic pillars in \u201cHigh Sparrow\u201d: Family. Specifically one family, for most of its middle section: This week\u2019s installment places an emphasis on the heirs to House Stark, one of whom embraces the family name and two of whom cast it off. When Tywin Lannister was still alive, claiming to be a Stark was a death sentence. Now Stannis uses the name as collateral in his negotiations with Jon Snow, and at least one resident of Winterfell declares \u201cThe North remembers\u201d to Sansa upon her homecoming. The North remembers the deeds and the guardianship of the Starks, and the North colors the proceedings of \u201cHigh Sparrow.\u201d Even scenes that take place away from Winterfell and The Wall carry those location\u2019s signature palettes and chilly atmosphere. Arya\u2019s new home in The House Of Black And White is dark, dingy, and stony, not too far removed from the chambers of Lord Commander Jon Snow or the confines of the Bolton-rebuilt Winterfell. It\u2019s a significant break from the scenes that bookend the episode, which opens with the reds and golds of King\u2019s Landing and concludes in the coastal sunshine of Volantis. It\u2019s a procession that establishes the ascent of the Stark name and the decline of the Lannisters\u2019 stock.Jon and Sansa are both privy to these shifting fortunes, but only the latter acts upon it. \u201cHigh Sparrow\u201d presents a curious arc for the eldest Stark daughter: Once more, she\u2019s forced into a power-consolidating marriage, albeit it one that could put her back in control of her ancestral home. Marrying the son of her brother\u2019s murderer is an additional twist of the knife, but since this is post-\u201cMockingbird\u201d Sansa we\u2019re talking about, she\u2019s packing her own cutlery. The pending betrothal marks the return of Westeros\u2019 most eligible bachelor, Ramsay Bolton, who\u2019s taken to flaying disobedient subjects alive and displaying their skinned corpses like hogs in a butcher\u2019s shop. Not all of the Boltons\u2019 Winterfell renovations count as improvements.But in relying on the Starks\u2019 renown and prominence, Sansa also puts herself in a situation where she must give up the family name. Is she still a Stark at heart if she\u2019s a Bolton by marriage? Her sister\u2019s trials in The House Of Black And White indicate \u201cYes.\u201d There\u2019s much intrigue and mystery to be wrung from this new setting, but the ceaseless sweeping and the cryptic riddles of Jaqen H\u2019gar bring the sensation of Arya banging her head against the wall to the experience of watching \u201cHigh Sparrow\u201d\u2014and not in a good way.It feels contradictory to write those words a week after praising \u201cThe House Of Black And White\u201d for its ambiguity, but whereas Arya\u2019s scenes in that episode came off like a mystery, these ones feel more like a taunt. It\u2019s no small feat translating a character\u2019s frustrations in this manner, but the House Of Black And White sequences this week bear too much resemblance to video-game dead ends. To connect Game Of Thrones to another popular fantasy franchise, if season five was The Legend Of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening, H\u2019gar would be the laughing raccoon at the edge of the Mysterious Wood. There\u2019s satisfaction in halting the damn raccoon\u2019s damn riddles by sprinkling him with some damn magic powder (i.e. dropping Arya\u2019s possessions in the sea), but that satisfaction is diluted by the wheel-spinning that precedes it.Arya\u2019s season-five arc appears to be one that the writers need to stretch in order to keep it going. Fortunately, there are other developments within \u201cHigh Sparrow\u201d that move at a more rapid clip. Jon Snow\u2019s promotion makes for one of the livelier visits to The Wall in recent memory, strategically keeping one enemy close while sending another to the chopping block. Executions are becoming a regular occurrence at Castle Black, but the beheading of Janos Slynt still sends a clear signal: Jon Snow may be understanding, but he will suffer no insubordination. He is resolute in his decision-making, an implication of the execution that\u2019s intended for Stannis as much as it is the members of the Night\u2019s Watch. The end of Janos\u2019 watch seems an obvious climax for the episode, but it\u2019s a mere prelude to the introduction of Jonathan Pryce as \u201cHigh Sparrow\u201d\u2019s titular character. (His followers are extremists, but the High Sparrow appears reasonable enough, an eccentric philosopher who casts quite the spell on Cersei.) The true climax arrives when Tyrion makes the ill-advised decision to leave the carriage, putting him in the crosshairs of a disheveled, eager-to-redeem-himself Jorah Mormont.Because he didn\u2019t see the head that was delivered to his sister last week, Tyrion tells Varys that he\u2019ll just be \u201cone more drunken dwarf\u201d among the residents of Volantis. But nobody would ever mistake Tyrion for a Faceless Man: Partially out of intoxication, and partially out of lust, he can\u2019t help but be himself in public and in the brothel. (A Lannister in the streets and a Lannister in the sheets.) He sarcastically dismisses the red priestess\u2019 sermon about Dany, he flexes his easygoing charm and confidence while chatting up a prostitute. Even as he runs from his family members, he can\u2019t help but leverage the family name for a good screw: \u201cI always pay my debts,\u201d he says in the brothel, slyly alluding to the Lannister motto. \u201cI\u2019m well known for it.\u201dWithin this episode of Tyrion And Varys: No Reservations, \u201cHigh Sparrow\u201d delivers its sharpest points on names and identity. Tyrion can\u2019t disguise himself or his parentage\u2014not that he puts much effort into it. The Lion isn\u2019t a brand like those worn on the faces of the Volantene slaves, but it might be more difficult to cast off. After Varys runs down the identifying and degrading marks of the city\u2019s slave trade\u2014\u201cflies for dung shovelers, hands for builders, tears for whores\u201d\u2014he and his traveling companion are treated to an address from a woman of faith who\u2019s become more than the tear on her left cheek. There are traits, duties, and expectations imprinted on all of these characters\u2014not all of them so easy to see.Jorah Mormont wears his displeasure for Targaryen role play pretty evidently, though. He\u2019s the Members Only Guy of \u201cHigh Sparrow\u201d\u2019s final scene, sharing a physical space with Tyrion and Varys without any obvious overlap in their stories. They overlap before the cut to black, though there\u2019s enough ambiguity in Jorah\u2019s words (his first of the season, which are also the last words of \u201cHigh Sparrow\u201d): \u201cI\u2019m taking you to the queen.\u201d Does he mean the former queen who\u2019s seeking his captive, or the pretender to the throne who cast Jorah out in season four?One more scene like this and it\u2019s a pattern: Like Brienne and Pod last week, Jorah coincidentally crosses paths with a fugitive from King\u2019s Landing\u2014though, unlike Brienne and Pod, his intent is malicious and his pursuit successful. A man seeking redemption comes across the one quantity guaranteed to get him what he wants: Someone whose name is more notorious than his own.That\u2019s the thing about a name. Sometimes it needs to be cleared; other times it needs to be avenged. And as Game Of Thrones moves forward, sometimes it can be abandoned in the hope of starting all over again.", "episode_35": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of    view  of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.\nI\u2019ve been writing about this show for three years now, so I know the routine. Everything goes crazy in the middle of the season, then we slow down for a second just to get everything in place for the last big push, whatever that may be. There\u2019s a lot of things brewing: Daenerys has an army, Mance Rayder is marching to the Wall, Joffrey is going to get married, Robb is planning his big Lannister assault, Petyr and Varys are up to\u2026something. But there\u2019s more pot-stirring that needs to happen first, and if you\u2019re looking for epic shit, you\u2019re going to have to be satisfied by the awesome wall-climbing sequences this week (which were pretty darn satisfying).\nI think that every time we spend more time in the North, things slow down. I love those characters and that landscape, but if we\u2019re in the North, we\u2019re with characters struggling against greater powers, or working to wrest power from them. In King\u2019s Landing, it\u2019s all about intrigue and subtle sniping and wily characters like Tyrion, Tywin and Varys. Up North, everyone\u2019s just trying to stay alive. Robb is the first to say he\u2019s a dynamic warrior, but outside of the battlefield, he needs everyone to keep together, which is tough to do considering he just chopped a lieutenant\u2019s head off and he fucked everything up by marrying the wrong girl in the first place.\nEdmure Tully is obviously a pain in the ass, but I have to sympathize with him being forced to marry some unseen Frey girl just because Robb made sexy eyes with a cute nurse. Robb\u2019s betrayal would have made more sense if it gained them any strategic advantage, but it didn\u2019t, and it makes him a tough leader to respect, honestly. From where I\u2019m sitting (a comfortable couch in Brooklyn) Robb ain\u2019t looking too impressive right now.\nBran and his band of swamp folk are making even less progress\u2014this week we only get one scene with them as Meera and Osha agree that one is better at hunting, and the other is better at skinning, but not before threatening each other\u2019s lives over it. Yes, there\u2019s an interesting tidbit about Jojen\u2019s visions\u2014he has crazy seizures and Meera helps him through them, perhaps a dark portent for Bran\u2014but otherwise, I need something to happen here. We\u2019ve known that Bran\u2019s full of weird visions for three seasons now. Jojen hasn\u2019t really given us new info, just vague hints. Something more concrete would be wonderful.\nArya has a pretty bad time this week too, since Melisandre shows up to say hi to the Brotherhood and buy Gendry from them, disabusing Arya of whatever shred of respect she might have had for Beric and Thoros and the merry bandits. But Gendry\u2019s fate, whatever it is, is more intriguing than miserable (Melisandre is certainly very interested in him, perhaps for his royal blood) and I was glad to see the whole concept of the Lord of Light religion explored in more detail, since it\u2019s all been a bunch of vague, dark chatter until now. Melisandre is astonished that Thoros can revive Beric from the dead, and so is Thoros (Paul Kaye does very well with his big soliloquy). So the limits of the Lord of Light\u2019s powers are not defined, but even the idea that Melisandre doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on feels like new information. She does get to dispense a bunch of portentous, mysterious prophesying for Arya, just in case she felt too grounded for you guys this week. Apparently there\u2019s a bunch of eyes in her future, and they\u2019ll meet again. Well, shucks, thanks for that, lady.\nThe most intense, and most grueling up-North action is a solid tie: it\u2019s either Jon and Ygritte climbing the Wall with Tormund, or it\u2019s Theon getting tortured for what is now admitted to be no good fucking reason. Let\u2019s start with Theon, whose torturer reveals a disturbing, impish energy we haven\u2019t seen before. He got the information he needed (the Stark children are alive) and now he\u2019s just going to go to town on poor Theon for no real reason at all. What remains to be learned is his affiliation, but I think we have our answer. Keen-eyed viewers like myself might spot the banner in Roose Bolton\u2019s chambers later on in the episode. His red man is hanging upside down on a big X, much like the one Theon\u2019s nailed to. The show does its best to make that visual clear without being completely ostentatious (it took me this long to notice it) but I think it\u2019s clear Theon is held captive by the Boltons, who seem like an increasingly unsavory bunch. Sure, Roose maintains an air of hospitality, but one of his dudes cut off Jaime\u2019s hand, and the other is the sickest fucker alive.\nThe wall-climbing is really just this week\u2019s best example of how bloody spectacular Game Of Thrones can be. There\u2019s not a lot of plot\u2014sure, there\u2019s a Touching The Void moment where Ygritte and Jon get cut loose, and some hot top-of-the-Wall action to close out the night. But it\u2019s mostly just visual splendor, blasting snow, gripping tension, etc. Now they\u2019re at the top, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s next (I didn\u2019t really follow as to why they were climbing the Wall in the first place) but it was fun to see them get there.\nNot much news down south, but probably the most memorable scene of the night pitted Tywin against the formidable Oleanna, who proved herself quite a match for him, if you had any doubt about that. Tywin does win out\u2014Sansa can\u2019t marry Loras, since Tywin will just appoint him to the chaste Kingsguard if he denies Cersei\u2019s hand\u2014but at no point does he even faze Oleanna, who happily admits to Loras\u2019 sexual orientation (\u201ca sword-swallower through and through!\u201d) and fights back with Cersei\u2019s unhappy incest rumors. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare-enough thing, a man who lives up to his reputation,\u201d Oleanna says of Tywin, high praise indeed, but he could certainly say the same for her.\nTyrion ruefully notes that everyone is getting the shit end of the stick in this bargain, although even Cersei agrees that Sansa is probably the worst off of all, stuck married to Tyrion having had freedom, and the apple of her eye (Loras) dangled in front of her. We probably could have been spared a very silly scene where Loras goes on about flowers and dresses and wedding parties (we get it, he doesn\u2019t like ladies, yeesh) but Sansa\u2019s tears as she watches Petyr depart at the end of the episode are pretty powerful.\nThe episode ends on a very nasty note, however, disabusing us of a notion we never really held\u2014that Petyr is in any way a sympathetic character. He and Varys have one last standoff before Littlefinger\u2019s departure, and we understand the fundamental difference between their scheming. They both crave power, but in different ways, and for understandable reasons. Varys wants order, he wants the realm in the best hands possible, and that\u2019s why he looks out for men like Ned or Tyrion (and sings the praises of Daenerys)\u2014he sees the value in someone smart over someone he can control. But Petyr just wants chaos that he can stay one step ahead of, constantly poking his head out of whatever rubble he\u2019s brought down on everyone else.\nSo Petyr, in a final act of spite and loose knot-tying, gave Ros to Joffrey for torture (we see her arrow-ridden corpse tied to his bed, an image that\u2019s hard to shake), both as punishment for informing on him and as a last bit of favor to his benefactor. It\u2019s a sad loss of a character who came to represent quite a lot for this show, and I hope it\u2019s something that isn\u2019t forgotten within an episode. Because if it was just intended as a dramatic button to a slower-moving hour, it comes off as a bit of a waste.\n", "episode_34": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of     view  of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Remember: Discussions of    things   that were different in the books or confirmations of things    that\u00a0won\u2019t\u00a0happen count as spoilers, too. Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.\nI always enjoy the Game Of Thrones episodes scripted by George R.R. Martin. He has such a feel for his characters that their dialogue always feels more natural\u2014since so much of the dialogue on this show is expositional (plot and character-wise) that\u2019s a real skill, and it\u2019s too bad he only gets to write one per year. Although I suppose he should be working on those books so we can get more seasons of this thing before it catches up to the present.\n\u201cThe Bear And The Maiden Fair\u201d is very concerned with the show\u2019s many romantic pairings, from Jon and Ygritte\u2019s still-new, inflamed passion, to Tyrion and Sansa\u2019s forced arrangement, to Jaime and Brienne\u2019s deepening bond. I wouldn\u2019t call it action-packed, but it\u2019s a very satisfying hour, again thanks to Martin\u2019s script, which really has a feel for what\u2019s going on in these characters\u2019 heads. There\u2019s a bit of a nagging sense that we\u2019re in a holding pattern\u2014marriages are still just being planned, the wildlings\u2019 mission remains frustratingly vague, a lot of characters are just running around aimlessly. But there\u2019s enough cool shit to make it forgivable.\nI really like where Daenerys\u2019 story is going, even though it\u2019s obviously going to be a slow march to Westeros. Which makes sense\u2014those dragons are cool, but they\u2019re still pretty eensy, more on the person-burning scale than city-invading. So she\u2019s set her sights on liberating the slave cities at all costs. Her work in Astapor was a resounding success, freeing all the slave soldiers and getting them on her side. Now she\u2019s outside Yunkai, which seems to be the home of pleasure slaves, and also guarded by big enough walls that a siege would prove very costly, Unsullied army or no.\nDaenerys is, almost as a wink to the audience, offered as many boats as she needs to get the hell out of town and go invade Westeros like everyone wants her to. But the show simply isn\u2019t ready for that, and her feelings on slavery are so well-established that her new direction doesn\u2019t feel forced in the slightest.\nDaenerys\u2019 encounter with the \u201cMaster of Yunkai\u201d was one of the coolest scenes in the episode. Emilia Clarke has really honed the steely badass side of her character so that it now feels like the most natural thing in the world for her to take this guy\u2019s gold and send him on his way without blinking an eye. She\u2019s so cool that it\u2019s rendering Jorah\u2019s presence increasingly redundant\u2014Barristan I get as a bodyguard, but Jorah has been reduced to an annoying voice of caution, usually ignored and often not even a good advisor. One wonders if Daenerys\u2019 blunt dealings with Yunkai will bite her in the ass eventually. But right now it seems like she can do no wrong.\nThe wildlings\u2019 plan for invasion, though, seems more and more foolhardy. We don\u2019t really know much outside of Mance lighting some big fire (lighting the Wall on fire? Is that what he\u2019s planning?) and I still don\u2019t really understand why Tormund, Jon, Ygritte, Orell et al are bouncing around in the north right now. Whatever Jon does know, he\u2019s not impressed, charging that Mance has no hope of success and generally fretting with Ygritte.\nA lot of this material is re-hashing the last couple weeks. Ygritte has already made it clear to Jon that her loyalty lies with him as long as he\u2019s with her; she repeats that this week, but it\u2019s seriously old news. Orell makes a romantic overture to Ygritte, saying Jon\u2019s too different for her, but it\u2019s hard to take that seriously, even if he\u2019s a fellow wildling. Honestly, I\u2019m not really interested in a love triangle developing with these kids right now. I\u2019m way more interested in whatever Mance has planned. Credit to Rose Leslie, though, who\u2019s selling Ygritte\u2019s deepening passion for Jon\u2014we understand that she\u2019s a little frightened about falling for him, just by the look on her face.\nWe get a more intimate look at Robb\u2019s relationship with Talisa this week too, something we haven\u2019t really seen since they got together in season two. Ever since then she\u2019s been this problem floating over his shoulder\u2014the reason for all of his troubles even though he remains a great military leader. Is she worth it? Hard to tell, really. She\u2019s pregnant, which Robb is understandably pleased to hear, and she\u2019s gorgeous, but the major vibe from their bedroom scene is that she\u2019s a lingering distraction. \u201cI can\u2019t plan a war with you looking like that,\u201d Robb quips to his naked queen, a joke that\u2019s perhaps a little too on the nose, but nonetheless, we get it.\nStill, the Stark with the most problematic coupling is definitely poor Sansa, even though, as Margaery points out, Tyrion is the best Lannister you could hope to be marrying (she even says he\u2019s handsome). Everyone\u2019s now discussing the question of their prospective sex life, from Bronn (who\u2019s all for it) to Margaery (who has heard tell of Tyrion\u2019s skills) to Shae (who is jealous). Shae has become a problematic character for this show. She\u2019s very sweet in her scenes with Sansa, but with Tyrion she\u2019s just an annoying shrew, which is no fun for either of them. Given that so many of his scenes have been with her this year, it\u2019s really killing Tyrion as a character. I\u2019m sure this is a situation where the book just had Tyrion out of action for a little while and there\u2019s not much that can be done about it. But Peter Dinklage is certainly twiddling his thumbs after having such a baller role last year.\nAs has been true all season, the best scenes of the episode came with this year\u2019s breakout characters\u2014Tywin, Jaime, and Brienne. Tywin only gets one, but it\u2019s with Joffrey, and it\u2019s a real knife-edge moment, as the king\u2019s loyal adviser and grandfather has to balance his hatred for the boy with the required deference. I loved Charles Dance\u2019s slow walk up the stairs to the iron throne, as Joffrey mewls about the small council meeting without him and climbing the stairs to Tywin\u2019s tower, hissing the line, \u201cWe could arrange to have you carried.\u201d What a wonderful mix of disgust and obedience.\nThe scene is also interesting from a practical standpoint in that we learn just what Tywin et al know about Daenerys\u2014they know what she\u2019s up to and they know she has dragons. But since they\u2019re little buggers, they figure they\u2019re along the same lines as the last Targaryen dragons, stunted things with skulls the size of apples. \u201cThe biggest,\u201d Joffrey reminds him, \u201cwas the size of a carriage.\u201d That was the old days, Tywin assures him, rolling his eyes, and this is now. But boy oh boy am I excited to see some dragons with heads the size of carriages. When do we get that?\nJaime and Brienne\u2019s interactions follow the playbook this whole buddy-cop comedy has been on since the beginning\u2014first they hated each other, then they developed grudging respect, now they\u2019re basically soulmates. Jaime\u2019s transformation would not be as believable without the loss of his hand (just five or so episodes ago, he was still a total jerk), but as it is, it\u2019s completely believable and just wonderful to behold. He promises to rescue the Stark daughters and complete Brienne\u2019s mission, but that\u2019s not enough\u2014he leaves the Bolton castle and quickly realizes what trouble she\u2019s in, cashing in on his name to secure her safety.\nEven then, it\u2019s almost not enough to save Brienne who has been put in a fighting pit with a LIVE BEAR. Just who the hell is this Locke dude and why is he allowed to do such heinous things under Roose Bolton\u2019s nose? Even within the anarchic confines of the Game Of Thrones world it seems like this kind of shit wouldn\u2019t fly. The bear sequence is bravura stuff and even though I had no doubt of Brienne\u2019s survival it\u2019s tense, thrilling television. It\u2019s also one of the rare episodes to end without a cliffhanger\u2014just a big kiss-off from Jaime, who doesn\u2019t get to slice Locke into pieces (I wish he would) but does leave Harrenhaal with his sanity and Brienne intact. That\u2019s as close as an ending gets to happy on this show, but let\u2019s remember, we\u2019ve got three episodes to go.\n", "episode_37": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of   view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.)\nIt is no small feat that Game Of Thrones can so thoroughly telegraph a plot twist and still pull it off with ultimate shocking panache all the same. I\u2019m not talking about last week\u2019s cliffhanger with Jaime Lannister\u2019s sword hand\u2014that was masterful and among the best cuts to black I\u2019ve seen on any TV show in a long time. But that came out of nowhere. Sure, I figured bad things awaited Jaime, but nothing that drastic.\nOn the other hand, I definitely figured the Unsullied slaver making constant jabs at Daenerys wasn\u2019t long for this world. I never really believed that she would trade a dragon for the army, or even could\u2014as Daenerys notes, dragons aren\u2019t exactly easy for just anyone to take care of. His demise, which closed the episode (Daenerys only appears in the last five minutes), did not shock me. But it did have me jumping off my couch and pumping my fist because every single element of its execution was flawless, awesome, and affirming of Daenerys\u2019 character in a way we haven\u2019t really seen since season one.\nI really got a kick out of the specifics of how it unfolded. The reveal that Daenerys spoke the slaver\u2019s language was delicious\u2014not that surprising in retrospect, but not a detail I predicted for whatever reason. It explained her desire to save his translator better\u2014it\u2019s not just a tactical move, there\u2019s an element of compassion too, or at least recognition that she wasn\u2019t remotely in league with her master.\nEven better was how the dragon\u2019s freedom was underlined and tied to Daenerys\u2019 identity. She is the mother of dragons, of course, but they also represent her unfettered id, that Targaryen rage we saw in her brother, except much more effective. \u201cA dragon is not a slave,\u201d she tells the slaver before he gets flash-fried; the Unsullied are commanded to butcher their former masters and then join her as free men. The implications are somewhat terrifying.\nOn the one hand, Daenerys taking the reins and finally getting her hands on some real firepower is just awesome. It\u2019s a lot more fun to see her leading an army and three truly dangerous dragons; this definitely beats futzing around in the desert or talking to a bunch of boring old Qarthians. On the other hand, she now has an ARMY OF ROBOT PSYCHOS who seem happy to obey her every command. It\u2019s a terrifying prospect, even though we love and respect Daenerys, and I\u2019m sure I speak for all of you when I say we embrace her whole anti-slavery stance. It\u2019s also a prospect that can lead to many an intriguing plot direction. I await eagerly.\nBut that\u2019s a lot of talk about five minutes of what was an insanely satisfying, shocking episode. In any other week, the true standout moment would be the horrifyingly memorable, shocking death of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, a scene so chaotic I\u2019m still trying to unpack it. His death is the out-of-nowhere punchline to a much more predictable moment, the long-brewing rebellion of the Night\u2019s Watch against Craster, him with all the daughter-wives.\nI\u2019m honestly surprised it took this long to happen, and Jeor\u2019s ultimate mistake was definitely trying to brush over Craster\u2019s most depraved behaviors even though everyone knew what was going on. Still, the last thing I expected was him getting stabbed in the back by his own men. James Cosmo has been such a titanic presence on this show, one of the many Game Of Thrones actors who visually just fit right in to his role. I\u2019m glad Jeor didn\u2019t go down easy, and his delayed reaction to the fatal wound made sense to me, but god, I wish he could have taken down a few more traitors with him. The Night\u2019s Watch oath is one of the holier-feeling things on the show; sure, these guys aren\u2019t perfect, but a man\u2019s got to have a code.\nInstead, Sam is on the run, trying to rescue poor Gilly and her baby as everything goes to shit at Craster\u2019s. It\u2019s his first truly wise decision in a while, given that Jeor and Jon were all that was really protecting him from a hellish life among his new brothers. And plus, if things go wrong up north, he can always eat Gilly! Just kidding. I know he\u2019s got a big old crush on her.\nThis was pretty much a flawless episode. One scene that really bothered me was the Pod stuff, which I still can\u2019t really grasp. On the one hand, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s being addressed here because that means the championing of his innate sex skills in the last episode wasn\u2019t some pointless throwaway moment. On the other hand, it still doesn\u2019t really track. Pod is possessed with such great prowess that every one of Petyr\u2019s prostitutes is declaring him the best ever. Sure, his conversation with Ros segues into Sansa eventually, but I\u2019m still waiting to see how this all turns out.\nThe other scene I could have done without was Theon\u2019s mind-fucking\u2014the guy who rescued him last week just leads him back into the torture chamber for\u2026 guess what? More torture! Yaaay! So this was just another mind game on top of everything else? I think I get that Theon is going through hell, guys! Now I\u2019d like to know who his torturers are! I\u2019ve read that this is material that\u2019s not really covered in the books, and there is that feel of a thin thread of info being stretched as far as it can in these early episodes.\nTyrion is a minor presence here but is present for an intriguing, unsurprisingly creepy bit of backstory from Varys, who explains the method of his castration (dark experimentation by a sorcerer) and then, in a true display of force, shows Tyrion that he\u2019s finally obtained his former torturer, locked in a crate, and lord knows what he\u2019s going to do to him. Probably not just talk mellifluously.\nBut what is it all about? It\u2019s nice for us to know about Varys\u2019 origins, and his hatred of the dark arts lends some shading to his decision to settle in the grittier environs of King\u2019s Landing, oppose Stannis and Melisandre, and place such a high price on the one weapon he could still wield, information. But in telling Tyrion, is he trying to indicate that he\u2019s an ally, or one to be feared? The motivations of the aristocrats, like Tywin and Robb and even Margery, are easy enough to understand. But operators like Petyr and Varys are much more complicated\u2014they are webs of disparate alliances, some stronger than others, and I feel it will take us years to truly unpack their goals.\nBut Tywin, as always, keeps it real. Cersei comes to make the same overture her brother did: highlighting her strengths, noting her siblings\u2019 weaknesses, and essentially asking for a Lannister promotion. Tywin immediately dresses her down, concentrating on her most obvious weakness\u2014the mess she\u2019s made of her son. Cersei isn\u2019t even good at keeping him in check even though her indulgence is partially what created such a monster. She fears that Margaery understands his psychosis much better than her, which does seem to be true from their scene together this week. But her protestations that Joffrey simply can\u2019t be controlled fall on deaf ears with Tywin. \u201cPerhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes,\u201d she snarks. \u201cI will,\u201d Tywin says, and ooh, that\u2019s something I want to see. Sure, Tyrion slapping Joffrey is always worth a chuckle, but god only knows what Tywin\u2019s going to do.\nA couple other plot threads get nudged at but leave things wide open for next week, which is fine by me considering how much this episode got done. Olenna and Margaery come to some agreement about protecting Sansa, which leads to Margaery offering her brother\u2019s hand and promising her safety in Highgarden. Perhaps the Tyrells are playing the long game, figuring that peace will need to be made with the Starks one day? And sure, Sansa sure has bad luck with the betrothed (I don\u2019t think Loras will be too interested) but she could certainly do worse, both politically and in terms of protection.\nAnd Arya meets the leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners, the eyepatch-wearing Beric Dondarrion (Richard Dormer, as far as I know no relation to Natalie). I had to check back with the episode, but indeed, he did appear in season one, tasked with taking down the Mountain by Ned Stark in his brief period ruling as the king\u2019s hand. Man, he would have gotten a lot of stuff done by now, don\u2019t you think? Anyway, Beric\u2019s been making trouble, and seems to have come around to Melisandre\u2019s \u201cone true god\u201d religion. I\u2019ve always seen that as a bad thing because Melisandre\u2019s followers have a hint of \u201cmindless drone\u201d to them, but maybe I shouldn\u2019t judge? Beric has a good head on his shoulders, even though trial by combat with the Hound might remove that.\nAnd God. Jaime and Brienne. Jaime, wearing his severed hand around his neck, a miserable talisman, taunting him by lying next to him all flat and grey after he\u2019s bested by Locke\u2019s men in the mud (even though he\u2019s using his left, he still puts up quite a fight). He tells Brienne he wants to die, and from a character perspective that makes sense\u2014he\u2019s been robbed of what truly made him special. But he still has a little fight left in him and a sympathetic recognition of his humanity from Brienne, who thanks him for sparing her life (the Sapphire Island is actually not too much with the sapphires, it seems). She gets no response. But there\u2019s much more to come in this buddy-cop story. The longer the odds lengthen against these two, the more fun it\u2019s going to be to watch them beat them.\n", "episode_36": "\nThis\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of   view  of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.\nDare I say, Game Of Thrones is getting very soapy indeed, and I like it. It\u2019s not like this show hasn\u2019t always had soapy tendencies\u2014it\u2019s serialized, there are a zillion attractive characters, everyone\u2019s in a powerful family, there\u2019s lots of sex\u2014but this episode was teeming with relationship intrigue and ended on a shocking plot twist revealed just through conversation. Sure, Jaime getting his hand cut off and cutting to black is gnarly stuff. But Tyrion being told to marry Sansa by his scary dad? \u201cYou will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her.\u201d My jaw was in a similar spot on the floor.\nTywin\u2019s arrival in court heeded a whole new set of rules in King\u2019s Landing, for sure. Cersei is cruel and unusual, but she\u2019s not that smart\u2014for example, this week she just marches up to Petyr and informs him that she thinks the Tyrells are plotting against her, which gets her information (she learns of the planned Loras/Sansa nuptials) but also leaves her exposed to Petyr\u2019s machinations, whatever they may be. Tyrion is super-smart, but he\u2019s also rational and less obsessed with Lannister power (more obsessed with his own well-being). Tywin is extremely smart and utterly merciless.\nCharles Dance, an MVP for this show since his very first appearance, was brutally good in that closing scene. He wears Tywin\u2019s steely poker face until Cersei puts up a fight when she\u2019s told she\u2019ll have to marry Loras, and then he unleashes the cold, parental fury that helps us understand why all of the Lannister children are so fucked up in their own special ways. Now, to be fair, Tywin has good cause to be disgusted with Cersei and even references \u201cthe disgusting rumors\u201d about her and Jaime. \u201cMy children. You\u2019ve disgraced the Lannister name for far too long,\u201d he spits. But at the same time, it might be a good idea to look at the source of the problem, dude.\nI\u2019m spending a lot of time on this last scene, but it really did flabbergast me with its brilliance. Tywin is furious that the Tyrells are plotting to seize \u201cthe key to the North\u201d from him, but he doesn\u2019t get bogged down in that anger, as Robert would have done. No, he\u2019s just plotting to stay one step ahead, and so we may be in for a Tyrion/Sansa marriage before the season is done. That\u2019s not a pairing I would have seen coming.\nAs soapy as this episode was, it still had that Game Of Thrones brutality I require. One of my favorite plots of the episode was our return to Dragonstone and the introduction of Stannis\u2019 wife and daughter, long a mysterious component of his backstory. We did glimpse his wife once before when he was introduced, but now she\u2019s played by Tara Fitzgerald and, well, she\u2019s a little much, even for dour ol\u2019 Stannis. It\u2019s quickly revealed that she knows he\u2019s been sleeping with Melisandre and approves (it\u2019s in service of God, after all), and that she\u2019s desperately wanted to provide him with a son but has failed in three attempts. Oh, and she keeps the fetuses pickled in jars in her room.\nNo wonder Stannis is taken with Melisandre; I never thought I\u2019d think she was more normal than someone, but she does seem to have more of a head on her shoulders. Now, Stannis\u2019 daughter is a different story\u2014very cute, bookish, obviously smart, a big fan of Davos (always a plus in my book) but afflicted by some nasty facial scarring that has kept her a recluse. Stannis could be due a moment of surprising affection when he sees his daughter again and she asks after Davos. But this is a man who refuses to varnish the truth. He informs her that her beloved Onion Knight is a traitor rotting in a cell. \u201cBest forget him,\u201d he says, making a sympathetic face at least. I practically punched the air with joy. Almost any other show would have milked that moment for cheesy sentimentality.\nContinuing on the soapy theme, there were not one but two scenes of flirtation in the bath. The slightly hacky, traditional one was Jon and Ygritte\u2019s union in some hot springs up north; she has to make the first, second, third and fourth moves, but finally, that\u2019s all over with, despite some mild protestations from Jon and pillow talk about him being a maid. I like Ygritte, but this scene had been so thoroughly telegraphed, so I didn\u2019t find it very interesting. More interesting is the assault on the wall\u2014get to that, please, gentlemen!\nMuch better was Jaime and Brienne\u2019s moment of intimacy in the tub at Roose Bolton\u2019s. Again, a little bit of an obvious moment (a naked Jaime stomps over and gets into Brienne\u2019s tub for no real reason other than sexual tension) but both he and Brienne were granted fascinating moments. Brienne defiantly standing up and presenting herself as the awesome warrior Jaime knows she is was much needed; her bashfulness was in character, but I didn\u2019t want that defining her. Jaime\u2019s story about killing the Mad King was even better, really defining his internal conflict. To him, killing the Mad King was a moment of heroism in a life of nihilism, saving a city from being set ablaze, and yet he\u2019s mocked and hated for it. The button to the scene, where Jaime collapses and Brienne refers to him as Kingslayer and he moans that his name is Jaime, was unnecessary, but whatever, I get it.\nMan, a hell of a lot happened in this episode. Beric\u2019s big fight with the Hound to lead everything off was a terrific piece of action choreography, flaming sword and all. It\u2019s harder to know what to make of the revelation that he\u2019s a zombie knight, revived by Thoros and the fire god. On the one hand\u2014awesome. I like the \u201cscience\u201d of the magic, that he returns a little diminished every time, covered in scars. On the other hand\u2014so, the Lord of Light can just bring people back from the dead? That\u2019s a huge bit of legitimacy for a religion I haven\u2019t taken seriously so far. Melisandre giving birth to the shadow assassin was one thing, but I figured she was just doing evil magic. I guess Thoros could be too, but he barely had to do anything, just say a prayer over Beric\u2019s dead body. Maybe sign me up?\nArya\u2019s scene with a newly-revived Beric was lovely, though. The Stark girls are the ones who were most traumatized by their father\u2019s death, since they were present for it, and Arya so rarely gets to talk about it, since she\u2019s always on the run. Beric assures her that his life is not one he\u2019d wish on the great Ned Stark. \u201cI would. You\u2019re alive,\u201d she says flatly. Maisie Williams, as ever, doing a terrific job in a storyline placed entirely on her shoulders.\nRobb\u2019s storyline is becoming a bit of a problem, however. Everything\u2019s obviously fallen apart for him\u2014Tywin is barely afraid of the northern armies anymore after getting thumped by them in previous seasons. The execution of scary, bearded Lord Karstark was a long time coming (since Jaime strangled his son and wasn\u2019t killed for it) but well-handled and grim. But it\u2019s tough to watch the wheels come off this bus so slowly. Right now, Robb\u2019s big plan is to attack the Lannister homelands with the help of Walder Frey, whom I remember from season one as a mean piece of shit weirdo played by David Bradley. And then Robb didn\u2019t marry his daughter. So I\u2019m sure that meeting will go just splendidly.\nFinally, after the exhilaration of last week\u2019s slaver-burning, Daenerys has marched her Unsullied to a new town and is still learning things about them, like that they\u2019re called things like \u201cGrey Worm\u201d to remind them of their meaninglessness. I loved, loved, loved the scene of the Unsullied leader explaining that he takes pride in his weird new name, because that\u2019s the name he was freed with. Everything about these human-robot soldiers fascinates me, and every detail like that just adds to the enjoyment. The jockeying between Jorah and Barristan is less interesting just because it\u2019s predictable, but there\u2019s so much potential to Daenerys\u2019 journey now. She can do almost anything with her soldiers now, and Barristan and Jorah are adjusting to the new concept of having such power and influence within their grasp.\nEven though last week was more chock-a-block with \u201choly shit\u201d moments, I really, really enjoyed this episode. Human intrigue is the backbone of Game Of Thrones, after all, and a bathtub monologue or a planned marriage can be just as crazy as a slaver getting set on fire by a dragon.\n", "episode_52": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

As it is, it still has a conclusion sure to blow the minds (and break the hearts) of all us non-initiated fans. The episode itself, while terrific, was not quite as fast-paced as a lot of the latter half of the season has been. But it's impossible to criticize this show for lack of narrative thrust considering those last few minutes.\nThe question is, for those of us who hadn't read the books, did you see this coming? Were you, like me, hoping against hope that Arya would somehow draw her sword and save her dad, or that Ned would be able to take the black and hang out on the wall with Jon? His plot was loosely linked with his illegitimate son this week, as both weighed the choice between honor and love. Ned, discussing his possible death with Varys, says he has no problem dying, since he's a soldier. But lying, throwing himself on Joffrey's mercy, and calling himself a traitor -- Ned says, and we know, that that's not in his character. And yet once he sees Arya in the crowd and Sansa next to Joffrey, the choice for him is no choice at all, since he desires to protect his kids more than anything.\nOn the flipside, Jon's talk with Master Aemon up at the Wall reveals that Aemon was once in line for the throne himself, as part of the Targaryen dynasty, but he turned it down to take the black, and had to remain neutral even when his family were deposed and killed. Jon is now wrestling with a similar choice as Robb heads to war with the Lannisters and Ned dies (although obviously he doesn't know that yet). Aemon's point is that the black watchmen, who have no wives or children, still have to wrestle with their familial ties -- something Jon will be doing even more now that Ned is gone.\nBenioff/Weiss and HBO really pulled off a grand trick with this one. All of the Game of Thrones marketing had Sean Bean front and center, and from the start it was clear he was our hero, our eyes into the world of Westeros. But as the show went on and everything seemed to go against him (even as he remained the steadfast honorable man), it became clearer that this wasn't a show about a traditional hero saving the day. Ned did everything right -- he challenged Robert's bad decision-making, he solved the mystery of Bran's attempted murder and Jaime and Cersi's parenting of the royal children, and he tried to maneuver Joffrey out of the throne once Robert died without bringing the nation to civil war.\nBut all that failed. Oh well. Ned's failure is his belief that he's playing on an honorable field, as we've discussed in previous episodes, and his mistakes are too many to number here. His final scene was very effective and disturbing. Everyone -- Petyr, Pycelle, Cersi, the Hound and the rest of them -- who had greeted Ned as the new Hand of the King at the beginning of the show (OK, Renly was missing, but apart from him) was there to see him die. It's clear that Joffrey's decision to kill Ned was not part of the plan, from Cersi's panicked reaction, given that it will just serve to piss everyone off.\nThe second Joffrey shouted his command and the slow countdown began, it was pretty obvious no one was going to rescue Ned, and, well, the whole thing was just very upsetting. Beautifully directed, very moving, and quite the tear-jerker. Ned's final act of compassion, having his man protect Arya from watching her father die, was especially touching. Unfortunately for Sansa, a prisoner in the gilded cage of the Red Keep, things aren't going to get any easier.\nJeez. What else happened this week? There was a lot of fighting, but all of it was off-screen. The majority of the episode focused around Tyrion -- Ned was only seen at the very beginning and end -- and Peter Dinklage rose to the occasion as usual. His little slumber party with Bronn and his new concubine was quite an amusing sight but turned into a very well-acted game of truth, as Tyrion revealed his sad history with romance, revealing more twisted layers to his relationship with his father. Those Lannisters are a fucked-up bunch.\nI'm happy to see that Tyrion remains his own special kind of hero -- his men win a victory on the field, but it's against a decoy force sent by Robb to draw them away from his main attack. And Tyrion isn't really there to savor the victory, since he gets knocked out with a hammer after rallying his men to battle (although that does technically give him a war wound, to the surprise of Tywin). In his scenes the night before with Bronn and Shae, we see his real fear over the idea of going into battle, and so, even though he doesn't participate, the sheer fact that he's getting thrown into the thick of it is a real growth for his character.\nRobb's doing a lot of growing up, basically assuming the role of Lord of Winterfell before his dad is even executed. I was happy that the negotiation scene between Catelyn and Walder Frey was kept pretty short, but after bitching about stalling tactics last week, I actually could have done with more Walder Frey, since he was played by David Bradley, the king of grumpy, cantankerous British thespians (he also did far more subtle work, recently, in Mike Leigh's Another Year). Maybe we'll see more of him next season, considering Robb is now engaged to one of his daughters. Catelyn's report on their beauty (\"One was\u2026\") is not encouraging, but Robb takes the news like a man, and later makes the decision to send 2,000 men to their deaths to draw the Lannisters away.\nIt's too bad we couldn't see Robb's guys take on the Lannister host, however. I know that every show has a budget, even one as opulent as Game of Thrones, but all this off-screen fighting is just getting my blood rushing for some on-screen fighting. There's been lots of excellent dueling and a few group fights (this week, Jorah's battle with the Dothraki was great) but I hope there's enough in the HBO coffers for one all-out war scene before the season is done. Jaime's capture could have been especially exciting. As it is, Nikolaj Coster-Waldeau is forced to simper at Robb and challenge him to some sort of ridiculous duel before being hauled off to the dungeons. I can't imagine Cersi will be thrilled with that development.\nOver in Dothraki-land, Drogo is in pretty damn dire straits himself, which is quite a leap from the slightly big flesh wound he had last week. I know riding around in the sun isn't going to heal him, but even still, by the end of the episode he's at death's door and the crazy witch lady is making some impressively fucked-up noises to try and save him. It all rushes by a little too quickly (if Ned wasn't dead, Drogo's death would probably feel like a bigger deal) but it does serve as a sad and effective reminder of Daenerys' loose grasp on power, assured only through a marriage deal she had no part in. Invoking Drogo's name (and Jorah armoring up to back her up) seems to be getting by for now, but somehow I don't think we'll be seeing a Dothraki invasion by next week, especially since she's in labor. I could have done without all that underlined \"this magic HAS A PRICE\" stuff, but I won't speculate on Daenerys' near future. I am beginning to see a pattern with this show, though -- there's always bad shit around the corner. Or, as Ned would have said, \"Winter is coming.\" Sob.\n", "episode_48": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

That's what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.)\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk of power on this season of Game Of Thrones, clearly a primary theme for a show that\u2019s centered around the struggle for the crown of Westeros. In the first episode, Petyr haughtily told Cersei that knowledge is power, and she rebuked him with a show of brute force. But it\u2019s becoming clear that he\u2019s more on the right track. Cersei might have the reins in the short term, but we\u2019re watching Tyrion snip those reins away from\u00a0her, one by one, by being the better operator. But Varys reminds him that simply holding the right cards isn\u2019t going to be enough. \u201cPower resides where men believe it resides,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a trick, a shadow on the wall.\u201d Tyrion can cast such a shadow, he implies, but it\u2019ll take more than brokering deals with men of influence.\nStill, there\u2019s a lot of that going on this week in \u201cWhat Is Dead May Never Die\u201d\u2014a lot of uneasy alliances, a lot of long-term promises being made to secure help in the present. We finally get our first glimpse of Renly Baratheon since he fled King\u2019s Landing and proclaimed himself king this week, and if anyone lives up to Varys\u2019 idea of casting a big shadow, it\u2019s him. Our introduction to his camp is a scene of two knights fighting, much like the opening of the second season, which saw The Hound beat his opponent to death. The fighting here is much less brutal, much more for show\u2014sure, Loras ends up getting rugby tackled by his opponent (more on her in a second), but there\u2019s no real danger here.\nCatelyn, not being particularly tactful in her role as Robb\u2019s emissary, tells Renly that her son is fighting a war, \u201cnot playing at one.\u201d Renly pretty much smirks and takes it on the chin, but there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s taking a different tack in his approach to winning the throne. He\u2019s raised a huge army, both through his personal charm (he\u2019s much more familiar and friendly with his men) and a marriage to Margaery Tyrell (Natalie Dormer) that has allied his house to hers. Catelyn is her predictable dour self, muttering that winter is coming (she\u2019s right to be dour, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a real buzzkill for Renly), but his real problem is that kings have to make heirs, and marriages have to be consummated, which is tough when you\u2019re gay and in love with your wife\u2019s brother.\nThe fun twist to this plot is that Margaery Tyrell is obviously not the blushing maiden she appears to be, but an operator just like everyone else\u2014she knows her husband is gay (a fact that shocks him) and is happy to invite Loras into the bedroom if that\u2019ll get things going. It\u2019s a great introduction to her character and a welcome reminder that Game Of Thrones is a show that rarely traffics in clich\u00e9d characterization. Margery could just be a cypher, a mostly silent cog in Renly\u2019s plans for dominance, but instead she\u2019s going to be a lot more.\nSpeaking of strong female characters, we also met the teutonic Brienne (Gwendoline Christie) this week in equally surprising fashion: She\u2019s the giant in a suit of armor who tackles Loras in Renly\u2019s little tournament. We get less of an idea of what\u2019s going on with her\u2014she\u2019s devoted to Renly, and she wants to be in his Kingsguard, that\u2019s about it\u2014but she\u2019s an imposing presence just to look at, and will, I\u2019m sure, be sticking around on this show. You don\u2019t get an introduction like that for nothing.\nOver in King\u2019s Landing, Tyrion continues his mission of trying to avoid meeting the same fate as Ned by sniffing out who he can trust on the Small Council. Turns out that\u2019s Petyr and Varys, neither of whom leak his plans to marry off Myrcella to Cersei. Can he actually trust them? Probably not (obviously, we know Petyr had a hand in Ned\u2019s betrayal last season). But they\u2019re not directly allied to Cersei either, whereas Pycelle is completely in her pocket, and in Tywin\u2019s\u2014he spills his guts immediately upon being rumbled, saying he betrayed the Mad King, betrayed Ned\u2019s predecessor Jon Arryn (he didn\u2019t poison him, but he let him die), all in the service of the Lannisters. That should be great news for Tyrion, since he\u2019s a Lannister, but he\u2019s not dumb\u2014there\u2019s no familial loyalty between he and Cersei, and barely any with his father (that seems rooted mostly in fear).\nPycelle\u2019s downfall was kinda shocking\u2014even though he\u2019s a pious hypocrite, there was something weirdly upsetting about Tyrion\u2019s men cutting his beard off and bundling him off to jail. Tyrion seemed to have an idea, paying Pycelle\u2019s prostitute with two coins instead of the usual one (which, I assume, is the going rate for coitus interruptus-by-sword in Westeros). Maybe it\u2019s just that Tyrion is the closest thing we have to an audience surrogate, so watching him be so ruthless, while badass, is scary. But there\u2019s no doubt that the ruthlessness is working. Cersei throws a temper tantrum at the idea of Myrcella being married off to Dorne (a part of the world we still don\u2019t know much about, except that wine comes from there) but she obviously can\u2019t stop it from happening.\nTyrion still has a weakness, though, and that\u2019s Shae, who gets assigned as a handmaiden to Sansa in an effort to keep her from getting bored. Poor Sansa is already going through enough shit, and now she has to deal with an incompetent handmaiden, but it\u2019s obvious that Sansa\u2019s haughty lady mode (her default mode in season one) is really just there at this point as protective shielding. The idea of any kind of companion unattached to Joffrey and the Lannisters must be an exciting one for her.\nOur final lesson in uneasy alliances, and perhaps the scariest, came at Pyke, where Theon has pretty quickly abandoned his poor adopted brother and resolved to set sail with his father and sister to conquer the unattended north. This is a dickbag move, to be sure\u2014Theon considers writing a letter of warning, but instead burns it. Still, it\u2019s hard not to feel sympathy for Theon, who is very unloved. His bond with Robb always felt a little strained\u2014unlike Jon, Theon always had a whiff of being an outsider. Balon is hardly a model dad, and he\u2019s only giving Theon one ship to fight fishing villages with. As Theon points out, for all of Balon\u2019s tough talk, he surrendered to Robert and gave Theon away to Ned.\nStill, it\u2019s a real dilemma for Theon, since he\u2019s a man without a family\u2014rejected by his own father, raised by the Starks, belonging to neither. He\u2019s making the wrong choice by not warning Robb, since that would surely win more trust with the Starks. But throwing his lot in with his father makes sense from an emotional standpoint, and that grim baptism scene (Balon looks on, not proud, but not disgusted either) just reeked of abandonment issues.\nThis was a segmented episode, without too much flitting from one story to the next, and no appearance by Daenerys at all. It was bookended by the Starks: Jon and the rest of the Watch has to clear out of Craster\u2019s creepy house for his transgressions without any real repercussions, which really begs the question of why we spent three episodes there. Bran tries to convince Maester Luwin that when he dreams he\u2019s a wolf, he really is a wolf, which is getting increasingly obvious to us, but maybe not to him.\nThen at the end of the episode, we\u2019re treated to a pair of stunning vignettes: a conversation between Arya and her protector Yoren about dealing with the demons, and a brutal fight scene that sees Yoren dispatched in epic fashion while Arya, Gendry, and the rest are taken away by the Lannisters. Arya and Yoren\u2019s talk is great, very nicely acted by Maisie Williams and Francis Magee (particular props to Magee, since this was his last episode), filled with that hard-edged northern sympathy where Yoren can relate a story about burying an axe in a guy\u2019s head and make it seem like a lovely parable of overcoming loss and closure. Then, the minute the Lannister men arrive, he stands up and bellows, \u201cThere\u2019s men out there who want to fuck your corpses!\u201d\nHis takedown of several bad guys before finally being felled in a group melee was terrific\u2014maybe not as memorable as Syrio knocking down the city watch with just his wooden sword last season, but pretty fucking memorable nonetheless. Game Of Thrones is a show about a lot of things, but one thing it does well when it wants to is gruesome violence, and Yoren\u2019s death is a fine example. Note, though, that even after he\u2019s impaled with a sword and dies, he doesn\u2019t go down\u2014they have to kick his corpse to the ground. Is Arya in worse shape now? No doubt. She\u2019s off to some place called Harrenhal, which according to Petyr is a cursed castle. Sounds fun.\n", "episode_49": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what's coming? That's what ourexperts reviews\u00a0are for.)\nNow that Game of Thrones is done with the business of getting us up to speed with everything, it\u2019s back into world-expanding mode, a daunting task when you consider how much of that it\u2019s already done. But it seems there\u2019s always going to be more to learn about\u2014more places to visit, more characters to meet. The newest and most interesting plot thread in \u201cThe Night Lands\u201d is the introduction to Pyke and the Iron Islands, Theon\u2019s true homestead; other than that, everything else inches a little bit forward.\nGame of Thrones episodes are so expansive that they don\u2019t really have \u201cthemes\u201d per se, but this one does start with Arya peeing (her most vulnerable position, considering that she\u2019s pretending to be a boy), followed immediately by her Night\u2019s Watch protector Yoren aiming a knife at a Lannister man\u2019s crotch. The value (or lack thereof) of having a penis is definitely on this show\u2019s mind. Up at Craster\u2019s house beyond the Wall, there\u2019s something horrible going on with baby boys; over on Pyke, Theon is convinced he\u2019ll be welcomed with open arms as his father\u2019s heir, but finds he\u2019s been replaced by his sister Yara (we\u2019ll get to her in a minute).\nWe only glimpsed Arya last week, but here we get a better snapshot of her predicament: She\u2019s on the way to the Wall, hopefully with a stop in Winterfell, but people are combing the lands looking for her, so she\u2019s stuck pretending to be a boy. Gendry (whom we remember from last season) is also a marked man, since Joffrey has ordered the slaughter of all his father\u2019s bastards. There\u2019s a cute little spark between Gendry and Arya, though not so much a romantic one (Gendry is horrified that he\u2019s behaved so commonly in front of a noble lady), but everything\u2019s still tinged with the sadness of Ned\u2019s death.\nWe\u2019ve all acclimatized over the show\u2019s hiatus to the shock of Ned being killed off, but seeing Sansa last week and Arya this week brings us back there pretty quickly, and Maisie Williams, probably the most natural member of this show\u2019s outstanding youth ensemble, does a great job showing us how Arya\u2019s vulnerability and upset are giving her a steelier edge than ever. There\u2019s less here in terms of plot movement, but one imagines that the creepy, soft-spoken prisoner Arya spoke to (named Jaquen H\u2019Ghar\u2014I had to look that one up) is going to play some sort of role in the future.\nThe revelation of Arya\u2019s identity comes as some surprise to Gendry, but Theon\u2019s really the one who gets a shock this week when the rough-looking lady who takes him up to the castle on Pyke (and whom he instantly treats to some groping, in typical Theon style) turns out to be his sister. That\u2019d be bad enough\u2014a nasty spin on a simple twist that should serve as a lesson for Theon\u2019s gropey ways. But Yara (Gemma Whelan) has also gained the favor of her father Balon (Patrick Malahide) in the intervening years of Theon\u2019s life in Winterfell, and the glorious inheritance he had expected is not coming to pass.\nTheon\u2019s back-story was probably one of the most confusing aspects of season one\u2014I\u2019m sure there was more context in the books that got cut both for time purposes and because it\u2019s hard to convey such complicated history through the show\u2019s typical methods (that being, a sex scene with a prostitute). So this is really our first understanding of the Iron Islands, who rebelled against Ned years ago and were quelled, with Theon taken and raised in Winterfell as a kind of insurance. Balon lectures his son about \u201cthe iron price,\u201d a.k.a. taking things from people in battle rather than buying them, which seems a bit rich coming from someone who lost his last major battle. His armor must be getting rusty.\nBut Theon is nonetheless cowed. There have been consistent warning signs that, despite Ned\u2019s surrogate fatherhood, something is not quite right with that kid. He was a little too aggressive toward women and a little too hasty to resort to violence in any circumstance, as if trying a little too hard to prove himself as loyal to Robb. With the introduction of Balon, that chip on his shoulder makes a lot more sense. Yara\u2019s prowess, and favor with her father, comes from her skill as a naval leader\u2014even though Theon\u2019s been fighting alongside Robb, that\u2019s pretty much meaningless to dad. Unfortunately, that seems to put Robb\u2019s plan (get the Iron Islands\u2019 support by promising them independence) right out the window. \u201cI pay the iron price. I will take my crown,\u201d Balon says. And he\u2019s not interested in the Lannisters, either.\nThings are even rougher up beyond the Wall and out in the desert, where the narrative is moving the most slowly. We get another one-scene check-in with Daenerys, who loses one of her men to rival Dothraki who don\u2019t like a lady being in charge of things. There\u2019s a little more going on with Jon, but it\u2019s not the most interesting material because it involves him uncovering a mystery that seems pretty obvious. Where are Craster\u2019s male children? Well, considering all the furtive glances and the generally creepy atmosphere, they\u2019re probably killed or abandoned pretty quickly after they\u2019re born. But this is still treated as a revelation for the end of the episode, a bit of a let-down as a twist.\nSam also strikes up a friendship with a nervous-looking pregnant gal called Gilly (Hannah Murray, from the early days of Skins), who unsurprisingly wants out of the whole Craster situation. If she has a girl, Craster will end up marrying her; a boy will meet a quicker, but not worse, fate. That all makes sense. But this plot seems like trouble, because it has to do with Sam, whose defining characteristic is how sweet and na\u00efve he is. Jon looks very hardened and sure of himself next to silly old Sam, but still doesn\u2019t manage to keep his nose out of Craster\u2019s beeswax. Baby steps, I suppose: At least he tells Sam not to take in Gilly. He\u2019s still learning (maybe Mormont\u2019s little pep talk from last week will sink in at some point).\nContinuing with the world-building, we get a better picture of new character Davos this week, after he was introduced mostly looking grim in Stannis\u2019 background last week. Apparently he\u2019s a former smuggler, and a friend to a pirate (Lucian Msamati) whom he recruits to Stannis\u2019 cause. He also has a pious true believer of a son, very much in the Stannis mold. Now, the pirate (named Salladhor Saan) is obviously a less-than-honorable type who goes on about how he\u2019s going to fuck Cersei when he takes King\u2019s Landing for Stannis. \u201cI\u2019m not going to rape her; I\u2019m going to fuck her,\u201d he makes it clear, in case we were wondering.\nDavos seems to serve as a symbol of Stannis\u2019 past style\u2014this was a guy who allied with a smuggler and made him a knight. That doesn\u2019t seem to gel with the Stannis we\u2019ve met, but that makes it all the more useful as contextual information. For all of Stannis\u2019 piousness\u2014he thinks he deserves the crown not just by royal succession, but as Melisandre\u2019s messiah\u2014there is definitely more color to him than we\u2019ve seen so far.\nYou could say that\u2019s further revealed in his sex scene with the priestess, which seems at odds with his vows but in line with his intense bond to Melisandre. That scene is a bit too on the nose\u2014the little wooden ships falling beneath them perhaps a metaphor for how she\u2019s hurting him from a military standpoint. Last week, Stannis was defiant about allying with Renley or Rob, but in private with Melisandre, he\u2019s obviously worried that his brother can summon a bigger army. As enticing as Melisandre\u2019s words about the Lord of Light are, he won\u2019t be completely convinced until it translates into victory for him, it seems. \u201cI\u2019ve said the words, damn you, I\u2019ve burnt the idols,\u201d he moans. Apparently cheating on his (supposedly sickly) wife is part three of that. But, down to her wardrobe, Melisandre just screams \u201cred flag.\u201d\nI think the most satisfying part of this episode was watching Tyrion take care of business. Not only does he know what he\u2019s doing, but he does it with panache\u2014dispatching of Janos Slynt, leader of the corrupt city watch, in the night when no one will notice him being transported up to the Wall. But the show is quick to remind us that putting Bronn in charge is only an improvement in that Bronn has a fondness for Tyrion. Otherwise, he\u2019s a man who will do things for a certain price\u2014and isn\u2019t that what prompted Ned\u2019s downfall last season?\nLast week, while he was taking her down a peg, Tyrion also showed a hint of sympathy for his sister. There\u2019s more of that this week as he realizes her utter lack of control over her son. For all of Cersei\u2019s assurances last week that \u201cpower is power,\u201d that\u2019s not entirely the case when someone as nutty as Joffrey is in charge. He gave the order to kill Robert\u2019s children, and he\u2019ll keep doing things like that no matter what his mother or uncle say. The key for Tyrion, clearly, is to get everyone else on his side, which really lent charge to his conversation with Varys at the top of the episode.\n\u201cThe Night Lands\u201d is a nastier, broodier episode than the table-setting of \u201cThe North Remembers,\u201d and it doesn\u2019t have quite the same epic feel, but things are moving along slowly but surely. Hopefully, there\u2019ll be more from Daenerys and Jon in the weeks to come, but the intrigue at King\u2019s Landing and the excitement of the war are more than enough to keep things interesting.\n", "episode_40": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of  view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.)\nTwo things immediately occurred to me after watching the first episode of Game Of Thrones\u2019 third season. (I don\u2019t watch ahead of my reviews to keep myself truly unspoiled.) The first, which other reviewers have noted, is that this is truly unlike any other TV show, to the extent that it can be considered the pioneer of some new form of epic serialization, not bothering to wrap up any arc or theme within an hour but just point the viewer forward, leaving us salivating for more, more, more. There\u2019s a nominal cliffhanger moment to the episode, but it\u2019s not the kind of shocking twist you might imagine, just another intriguing wrinkle to a colossal story full of them.\nAt the same time, one can\u2019t help but watch \u201cValar Dohaeris\u201d and, for very similar reasons, be reminded of many a serialized show (like Lost or what have you) that succeeded at both ensnaring its viewers and frustrating them with a bit of delayed gratification. The final image of the season two finale, a giant snow zombie standing over the cowering Sam, left me slobbering with anticipation for the next nine months. Sure, we\u2019d seen glimpses of these nightmare creatures over the last two years, but now we were face-to-face with one and his army of monsters.\nLike any TV show would, the first scene of \u201cValar Dohaeris\u201d pretty much hits the reset button. Sam runs away from the Walker and gets saved first by Jon\u2019s wolf Ghost, and then by Mormont, who sets the damn thing ablaze (not easy in a blizzard), yells at Sam for not sending out ravens (again, not easy in a blizzard!), and commands his troops back to the Wall. As opening scenes go, it\u2019s not bad, but it\u2019s basically a bunch of dudes deciding that shit is fucked up beyond the Wall, and it\u2019s best to turn tail and run. It doesn\u2019t quite have the hook of the zombies\u2019 first appearance in the pilot, or Stannis standing over his dying advisor in the first episode of season two.\nGame Of Thrones is dense with plot, and I\u2019m sure there are many twists and turns to come this year, but it also knows it has to parcel these things out, especially since the third season is apparently only covering half of the colossal third book of the series. So the monsters are gone for now, and this episode is more about table-setting, not even checking in with a lot of our favorite characters (Arya, Bran, and Jaime come immediately to mind). That\u2019s fine. Every year this show takes a couple weeks to spool up, then it\u2019s always humming along nicely. And \u201cValar Dohaeris\u201d may not be action-packed, but it\u2019s still an incredibly fun watch, not just because it\u2019s wonderful to be back in this world again.\nHell, this show is so cool it\u2019s exciting just to see the opening credits again. Not much has changed, but Winterfell is now a smoky ruin, and Daenerys has left the dull if pretty Qarth for the seaport of Astapor, where she\u2019s chartered a boat filled with vomity Dothraki patrolled by her growing dragons. After a whole season that really went nowhere and was best represented by Xaro Xhoan Daxos\u2019 ornate safe door guarding an empty room, I\u2019m immediately much more intrigued by her adventures here where she\u2019s confronted by a serious moral quandary rather than a bunch of political doublespeak by a council of fat ponce idiots. (God, Qarth really sucked when you think about it.)\nDaenerys wants to be Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, and so far, she\u2019s got dragons, an alluring mix of charismatic leaderly steel and empathy for the common man, and her mighty Targaryen name to back her up. But she needs an army, and with most of the Dothraki very far away and uninterested after the death of Drogo, she goes to a one-stop army shop where an extremely distasteful slaver offers her the Unsullied, a group of 8,000 warriors trained in the most brutal, horrifying ways imaginable to utterly strip them of their humanity and seemingly any kind of free will.\nThey\u2019ve been castrated, they fear neither pain nor death, they can stand without food and water for at least a day and a night, and to win a shield, they have to drown a (slave) mother\u2019s baby in front of her, just in case they were ever thinking about having a happy thought again. At one point, the slaver cuts a nipple off an unreactive soldier in case we didn\u2019t get it. Daenerys is understandably horrified, but as Jorah tells her, she needs an army, and hey, these guys have already been put through unimaginable horrors, so one would reject them only because of moral compunction. Daenerys has fiercely disapproved of slavery throughout the series, but there\u2019s no way we\u2019re being shown these guys without a reason, so I can\u2019t wait to see how she gets her head around this.\nWe don\u2019t get much action up north, but beyond the Wall, Jon is led into the camp of Mance Rayder (Ciaran Hinds), a fine bit of casting if I say so myself. Hinds is the perfect mix of rugged and charming; since every Wildling lord and fighter we\u2019ve met so far is more your garden-variety guerrilla thug wearing coats of bones, there has to be something distinctive about Rayder, and we immediately pick up on it in this scene. Jon thinks some chicken-eating meathead is the boss, but Mance is lurking in the background, not needing to posture when he already has everyone\u2019s utter respect. It\u2019s hard to tell how much Jon wins him over; as a former member of the Night\u2019s Watch himself, Rayder clearly isn\u2019t stupid, but he\u2019s also talking about getting him a new cloak, so everyone\u2019s favorite bastard can probably breathe easy for another week at least.\nWe also get our first look at Davos in the aftermath of the battle of Blackwater; he\u2019s still alive, to my utter joy, although he\u2019s definitely worse for wear and still making stupid decisions like convincing his fun pirate friend to drop him off at Dragonstone AFTER being told that Stannis and Melisandre have become very fond of setting heretics on fire. But hey, that\u2019s Davos\u2014loyal to the point of insanity. His return to Stannis goes about as well as you could imagine, since Stannis never had the greatest temperament and he now holds Davos responsible for not letting Melisandre go to war with them (there\u2019s nary a mention of \u201csorry about your dead son\u201d), so Davos understandably loses his shit and tries to stab Melisandre. Guys, guys. Let\u2019s not fight. Let\u2019s get Stannis on the iron throne. It\u2019s all David Sims wants.\nMost of this episode\u2019s action takes place at King\u2019s Landing where a new power structure is settling into place post-Blackwater. Two Lannisters are going to have their power severely checked\u2014first, poor Tyrion, who is taken down several pegs in a brutal monologue by his father who confirms that he shouldn\u2019t look forward to any Lannister land, titles, or responsibilities anytime soon, let alone love or trust. Charles Dance is the master of long, nasty, but expertly-worded diatribes and makes this scene epically painful to watch, even though it\u2019s good for Tyrion to know where he stands.\nThe other Lannister (although he\u2019s technically a Baratheon) undergoing a reality check is Joffrey, whose name is mud after his pathetic performance in battle and who doesn\u2019t dare leave his royal carriage while being led around King\u2019s Landing. In this episode he gets quite the lesson in public relations from his new betrothed Margery, who is politically smart enough to know that she won\u2019t be respected as a Queen simply because she\u2019s marrying the little blonde shit. More importantly, with Tywin in control, Kings Landing and the kingdom will likely be ruled with a much more brutal fist and less given over to his pathetic whims.\nWhat\u2019s hardest to guess is how Cersei fits into all this. She\u2019s obviously worried about her status, posturing before Tyrion about her network of spies and worrying that he\u2019s going to tell Tywin a whole tissue of lies (i.e.: the truth) in an attempt to discredit her. But she\u2019s also not entirely without brains, or power, and with Tyrion diminished and Jaime on the lam, she\u2019ll be the real wild card this year. God know what she makes of Margery Tyrell. She\u2019s not usually someone who responds well to pretty, popular noblewomen.\nThere\u2019s a lot to digest here, but it\u2019s all fun. I can only assume episode two is just as dense and features a whole plethora of unseen characters. Along with Arya, Bran, and Jaime/Brienne, we\u2019re also missing Theon and the Hound and probably others I\u2019m forgetting right now. The important thing is that Game Of Thrones is back, and it\u2019s hit the ground without missing a beat.\n", "episode_41": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.)\nGod, I\u2019m going to miss this show until next year. It\u2019s the biggest clich\u00e9 in the world, but there honestly isn\u2019t anything like Game Of Thrones on television. Now, if you haven\u2019t watched the episode yet, get outta here, cause I\u2019m starting off at the end, with Sam hiding underneath a rock watching a bunch of ruined-looking corpses walk through the snow towards his friends. The image was cool\u2014the snowstorm that followed them was an especially nice touch\u2014but I was almost a little let down, since we\u2019ve seen these fuckers before, and I\u2019m maybe a little worn out on zombies.\nThen what I can only describe as an\u2026ancient frost demon? Rides by. On a dead horse. Making a noise you can\u2019t even begin to describe. This show is the War of the Roses shot through with Led Zeppelin. The alliances, the politics, the battles feel authentic, and then there\u2019s zombies, and dragons, and warlocks, and face-changing assassins, and it\u2019s easy to roll with that as well. There\u2019s nothing for us to turn to on TV that\u2019ll fill that void. We\u2019ll just have to wait patiently for nine months until the whole beautiful shebang gets kicked into action again.\n\u201cValar Morghulis\u201d was pretty much the opposite of last week\u2019s spectacularly focused \u201cBlackwater,\u201d satisfyingly dangling all of Game Of Thrones\u2019 many wonderful storylines over 70 minutes so that we\u2019ll be chomping at the bit for season three. I\u2019ve compared this show to The Wire before, even though they\u2019re universes away from each other in so many ways, and this finale really reminded me of that show. On \u201cBlackwater,\u201d shit went down, pretty spectacularly, and we were right there on the front line to see what went right and what went wrong. Now that that\u2019s over with, it\u2019s time for everyone to jockey for their new place in the world and try and survive (and most likely, not everyone will).\nThe biggest changes are afoot at King\u2019s Landing, where Joffrey has to wriggle out of his betrothal to Sansa to wed Margery, the lynchpin in a new alliance between the Lannisters and the Tyrells, an alliance we saw sweep through Stannis\u2019 forces last week. Luckily, the Starks\u2019 disgraced name makes the switch easy enough (although the crowd seems a little perturbed) but it was fun to watch the political theater\u2014Margery\u2019s declaration of love for a man her recently-dead husband had sworn to execute, Pycelle\u2019s assurances that the gods wouldn\u2019t be offended, Petyr\u2019s prize of Harrenhal for arranging the whole thing. That it was preceded, a scene earlier, by that glorious shot of Tywin\u2019s horse taking a dump outside the throne room\u2026never let it be said that Game Of Thrones is a subtle experience (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that).\nWith Tywin\u2019s arrival, however, comes Tyrion\u2019s near-banishment: Cersei\u2019s attempt on his life may have failed, but he\u2019s scarred-up, robbed of his political power, and sleeping in a much less spectacular room, all prizes for his brilliant defense of the city. He still has friends (Shae, Pod and Varys\u2014no sign of Bronn, but he\u2019s lost his job) but no influence, and Shae\u2019s offer to run away with him and dine and fuck until they die has to be an appealing one. But Tyrion\u2019s addicted to the game, like the rest of them. \u201cThese bad people are what I\u2019m good at!\u201d he tells Shae, and he\u2019s right\u2014that realization has been his character arc this season. He\u2019s no longer the wise jester of season one, getting in and out of deadly scrapes by his wits alone. There\u2019s more purpose to him now, even if that purpose is centered around the ridiculous, never-ending power struggle of Westeros.\nStannis, meanwhile, has been robbed of his religious fervor, although Melisandre is already promising that the Blackwater battle was the first fight in a long war. At this point, there were really two places for Stannis to go, and we saw both of them: he strangles his infuriating priestess, who\u2019s more cryptic than a character on Lost, but she eventually convinces him to look into the flames and he sees\u2026well, something. Who knows what. It\u2019s enough to re-kindle his fervor, possibly at greater levels than ever before. In the hands of another actor, this scene would feel like a bit of a cheat, but Stephen Dillane brings it home just with his eyes. Before, you always felt like Stannis had his feet in both worlds: a tactician and military leader at heart, swept up in Melisandre\u2019s promises of glory because it was what he wanted to hear. But from that look in his eyes, Stannis may have become a true believer.\nAs crazy as Melisandre seems, there\u2019s more and more evidence of the \u201cdark arts\u201d on this show, which have grown from being the ignored, mocked old wives tales of season one to a crucial part of the power dynamic. The white walkers have been around since scene one, of course, but that\u2019s a little different\u2014they\u2019re some unknowable force, demonically powered, inhuman to the core. Melisandre\u2019s spells were crazy, but they felt tied to reality\u2014Stannis needed to impregnate her to create the shadow assassin. But the warlocks of Qarth were straight-up wizards, conjuring crazy visions for Daenerys to walk through (including the welcome reappearance of Drogo, who probably had more lines in this scene than the entirety of season one) and then chains to bind her to her dragons.\nI liked the explanation for the warlocks\u2019 behavior: the dragons are enhancing their magic to levels they\u2019ve never seen before, which explains the coup and why they\u2019re not more notorious around the world. The upshot was predictable, but fun to watch\u2014perhaps powered by their mother being in danger, the dragons up their firepower from \u201cgrill\u201d to \u201ccharbroil\u201d and take that scary bald Scottish fuck down once and for all. Quickly enough, we realize that Xaro was full of shit and used Daenerys as a bargaining chip in his takeover of the city, another fairly obvious twist. It was hard not to take his empty safe as a symbol of Daenerys\u2019 plot this season, however. If season two had a weak link, it was in Qarth, because it seems that all our Khaleesi learnt was not to trust rich dudes without opening their safes first. It was a pretty short character arc thinly spread over ten episodes, so hopefully she\u2019ll be on a more involving track in season three.\nAnother straight-up piece of magic we witnessed was the goodbye of Jaqen, who changes his face in front of Arya and gives her a magic coin in case she ever wants to look him up again. Arya, word to the wise: it\u2019s a good move to hang out with unkillable, undetectable assassins who can change their appearance at will and have taken a shine to you. Definitely a better companion than Gendry, and that\u2019s no slight against Gendry. One thing\u2019s for sure: in Game Of Thrones, the eastern continent is way more magically-inclined than Westeros. Jaqen\u2019s from there, Qarth is over there, and I\u2019m pretty sure Melisandre hails from there. Robb should keep an eye on his new wife before she sprouts wings and breathes fire.\nThe only flaw with this episode is that it really leaves you wanting more. We just get little hints of some characters\u2014Tywin\u2019s on his horse, but he doesn\u2019t talk to Tyrion at all. Sansa grins because she\u2019s free of Joffrey, then gets propositioned by Petyr, and that\u2019s it. Brienne has one awesome scene bantering with Jaime and taking out some northern scum, but their perilous journey has just begun. Most exciting of all is Jon\u2019s showdown with the Halfhand right before things cut out\u2014as he hinted two weeks ago, the Halfhand goads Jon into killing him so he can join the Wildling club. We\u2019ll be meeting the King Beyond the Wall next season, and that\u2019s definitely something to look forward to, but I\u2019m fit to burst after watching this episode.\nSome characters\u2019 fates are particularly unclear. Davos, last seen being blown off a boat last week, may or may not be dead. Theon gets bonked on the head by his bastard first mate, and Winterfell is razed, but we never see a body. I was perhaps most disappointed by that, because Theon\u2019s story really felt like it had reached a natural conclusion. I loved his scene with Luwin (RIP), who begs him to go to the Wall and seek redemption. Theon has been a friend to the Starks this season, then he\u2019s been a coward, he\u2019s been a brute, he\u2019s been a fool. None of this really clicks with the path Luwin\u2019s suggesting, and he knows it, even if Luwin is right when he says he\u2019s not the man he\u2019s pretending to be. \u201cI\u2019ve gone too far to pretend to be anything else,\u201d Theon says, and he\u2019s right. His goodbye was pathetic, shot through with black humor, and a little sad, so I\u2019m frustrated that we didn\u2019t get complete closure on the story, but I\u2019m willing to believe there\u2019s a reason for it.\nThat leaves us with\u2026frost zombies. Hundreds of them. Closing on the Night\u2019s Watch. With Sam quaking under a rock and Jon in league with the wildlings. There\u2019s a lot to look forward to. I love the characters on this show, the intrigue, the encyclopedic knowledge it demands from its fans. But indelible images like that are what I love the most.\n", "episode_42": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of  view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.)\nExpectations are a total bitch sometimes. So when I say that there\u2019s no way that \u201cBlackwater\u201d could have actually lived up to the hype, that\u2019s not saying it ended up being a bad episode of television. But it certainly showed the limits of the medium, even for a network as the Scrooge McDuck-esque coffers of HBO. While there were a few epic moments indeed, a lot of it felt stitched together in ways that allowed the seams to clearly show. Luckily, even if the big picture stuff sometimes got muddled, there were plenty of smaller moments that the episode nailed. Given the choice between the two, I\u2019d always rather follow a few people inside a large-scale battle than watched a flawlessly produced battle sequence any day. But the two sides were at war with each other, even as Stannis\u2019 fleet waged war against King\u2019s Landing.\nThis season of Game of Thrones has shuffled between various parties in various locations across Westeros. The smartest choice that the George R.R. Martin-penned script did was keeping tonight\u2019s action in and around King\u2019s Landing. That type of focus doesn\u2019t mean the other stories don\u2019t matter, but accentuates just how out-of-place they would have been in this particular hour. There\u2019s plenty of time later on to judge how well this season of the show paced out its storytelling across its vast landscape. But seeing Theon Greyjoy or Jon Snow tonight would have taken away the urgency of the battle at hand in King\u2019s Landing. So while any episode without Arya Stark seems like less of an episode, her absence tonight was probably for the best.\nIn favor of those characters we get plenty of intimate moments with the Lannisters still inside King\u2019s Landing, along with those they have drawn into their web. We see Tyrion, having avoided a large battle last year but now potentially the only threat to Stannis Baratheon. We learn that fact from Varys, who seems to have intimate knowledge of the dark arts practiced by Melisandre. Varys might loathe Tyrion, but also prefers him around to those previously serving as Hand. Serving as moral support rather than armed warrior is Cersei, sent via long-held custom along with Sansa and the other women of the city to Maegor\u2019s Holdfast. While those two women drink wine and share stories of the roles women are forced to play in this particular game, Sandor Clegane starts to question his loyalty to King Joffrey. Joffrey talked a big game when Stannis\u2019 fleet was thousands of leagues away, but seems more ill-fit for rule than ever as his would-be usurper\u2019s ships come crashing down upon the shores.\nIf the geography and the tenseness of the battle itself were at times vague, \u201cBlackwater\u201d never had trouble in following the emotional paths of its main constituents throughout. In particular, Cersei\u2019s long night\u2019s journey into drunkenness and potential filicide added even more shading to an already complicated character. Many in Game of Thrones see themselves as the hero of their own particular version of the story. But lately, Cersei has viewed herself as a type of cancer, infecting the story and mutating it from something initially pure into something base. A lot of this has to do with Jaime\u2019s prolonged absence, but also in the way that Joffrey\u2019s innate sickness has grown (if not outright thrived) inside that vacuum. Throughout this installment, I expected her to use Pycelle\u2019s essence of nightshade on a variety of people: Cersei herself, Sansa, and Joffrey were all candidates at one point or another in my notes. But instead, it\u2019s meant for Tommen, the youngest of her children with Jaime. It\u2019s posited as a potential act of sacrifice, but it could also be seen as a way to prevent Joffrey\u2019s cruelty from taking hold in his unformed mind. Even if it\u2019s too late for Joffrey to be \u201ccured,\u201d so to speak, there\u2019s still time for preventative measures to be taken.\u00a0\nPreventative measures are what Tyrion attempts to employ at the outset of the battle, using wildfire in an incredibly creative way. Rather than hurling it down one pot at a time via catapult (ostensibly endangering King\u2019s Landing as much as Stannis\u2019 fleet), he loads up the sum total into a single ship from the harbor straight toward Stannis\u2019 Sailors. When the ship reaches those populated by Davos and his son Matthos, Tyrion signals Bronn to fire a single arrow into the ocean. Then? BOOM goes the (green) dynamite! It\u2019s a glorious, horrible, unexpected spectacle, and instantly one of the show\u2019s most iconic images. As a non-book reader, I had conflicting thoughts. The first? \u201cSon of a bitch, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d The second? \u201cUm, that can\u2019t be IT though, right?\u201d From Tyrion\u2019s point of view, that flame consumed everything from King\u2019s Landing to Qarth. In reality? It only knocked out a fraction of Stannis\u2019 fleet.\nAnd therein lies the problem with most of the actual Battle of Blackwater onscreen tonight: It was terrifically difficult to ascertain what was going on during various key moments of the battle. What I am sure played out in painstaking detail on the page turned at times into a murky mess inside the episode. That\u2019s a little strange, since most of the battle played out over a fifty-yard stretch of sand near the Mudgate. A few factors played into this confusion. Firstly, the nighttime setting, used to cut costs, made for a lot of dark shots that obfuscated the action. Secondly, our primary human-scaled POVs inside the warfare were The Hound and Bronn, two secondary characters who certainly have had some memorable scenes but don\u2019t particularly serve well as anchors around which we can emotionally anchor ourselves. Lastly, the pacing didn\u2019t feel as if it were steadily building towards an epic crescendo so much as intermittently starting then stopping again.\nThe pacing problem dovetailed directly into the scenes with Maegor\u2019s Holdfast. While they were well-written and performed admirably, they did not for a single second feel like they were taking place in the middle of a warzone. Lancel\u2019s repeated (and repeatedly wrong) in-person updates from the field might as well have been delivered from a battlefield five hundred miles away. Maybe the soundproofing acoustics in the Holdfast are just fucking incredible, but Ser Ilyn Payne\u2019s presence alone couldn\u2019t tie these scenes intimately with the bloody action on King Landing\u2019s doorstep. As tense as the moment was when Cersei nearly identifies Shae\u2019s true identity, the scenes leading up to that moment felt like strong character moments devoid of context. Yes, everything Cersei says and does is related to the battle. But there\u2019s a difference in that battle feeling impossibly beyond one\u2019s grasp and a battle literally outside your door. Most everything in the Holdfast felt like the former, not the latter, and it robbed both halves of the episode of some well-needed urgency.\nOne moment played with an alarming lack of urgency, yet worked like gangbusters, was Sandor\u2019s decision to stop playing Joffrey\u2019s perverted reindeer games anymore. Sandor saw a man on fire rushing to him in the heat of battle, and subsequently froze in place. Here\u2019s a warrior, who only moments either declared that he would rape the corpse of anyone who didn\u2019t have blood on their sword when they died, absolutely inert on the battlefield. Bronn\u2019s trusty bow and arrow save The Hound\u2019s life, but it certainly seemed like some childhood memory of The Mountain burning his face flashed before his eye. And rather than continue to serve the latest person to treat him cruelly, Sandor defiantly leaves the castle mid-battle. \u201cFuck the King\u2019s Guard! Fuck the city! Fuck the king!\u201d he coldly stated to an aghast Joffrey and Tyrion. If there were microphones in Westeros, The Hound would have then dropped one at the king\u2019s feet. Instead, he collects his things, collects Sansa, and agrees to take her home to Winterfell unharmed. \u201cThe world is built by killers,\u201d he tells her, when it seems as if she\u2019ll stay behind rather than being near his face. \u201cSo you better get used to looking at them.\u201d I loathed scenes with Sansa in the first season. Now? I anxiously await them. \u201cSansa and The Hound\u201d might rival \u201cJaime and Brienne\u201d for the best buddy road trip movie in the seven kingdoms.\nWith The Hound gone, and Cersei sending Lancel to collect Joffrey, Tyrion is left to pick up the pieces and inspire the troops with his own version of the St. Crispin\u2019s Day speech. Instead of appealing to their loyalty to the throne, Tyrion appeals to their baser, more selfish desires. Rather than thinking about Stannis taking the throne, he implores them to think about him taking their homes. That seems to do the trick, and by the end of the speech everyone is eating out of Tyrion\u2019s hand. \u201cThose are brave men knocking at our door. Let\u2019s kill them!\u201d he shouts, in one of Peter Dinklage\u2019s best line readings to date on the show.\nTyrion\u2019s earlier strategizing with Varys revealed a series of tunnels, more than fifty miles in length, built by the Targaryens during their reign as a means of easy and undetected escape. While Stannis scales the walls of that fifty-yard stretch of weak protection, Tyrion leads the remaining forces around the back to sneak upon those forces from behind. The victory gained is short-lived, and soon the first truly massive land force in the entire hour showed up to kick some late-episode ass. Whose forces these are is by design a secret, but we soon realize (just as Cersei is about to give a lethal dose of nightshade to her youngest son) that Tywin has led the massive force tardy to the Blackwater party. Instead of attacking Robb Stark in the north as he promised last week, he went south to save his family\u2019s place on the throne. Perhaps he finally figured out Arya\u2019s identity in Harrenhal after all, and lied in her presence as payback for Robb\u2019s deceit last season?\nWhile I appreciate how focused tonight\u2019s episode was on those involved in the battle, I do wonder how this retroactively colors the time spent with other storylines this season. Their lack of direct applicability or involvement tonight speaks to the fractured nature of the show at this point. If we can leave out a) Robb Stark\u2019s impending war against Theon\u2019s forces at Winterfell, b) Jon Snow\u2019s capture north of The Wall, and c) Daenerys\u2019 attempts to reclaim her dragons this late in the game, what does that say about their overall importance this season as a whole? It\u2019s a largely rhetorical question, because it would be foolish to assume time spent with them has been meaningless. But while it has seemed for a while as if many disparate forces might finally collide in tonight\u2019s huge battle, instead only a third of the storylines seemed to matter in the series\u2019 grandest episode to date. Again, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that focus. But why set up so many pieces last week only to ignore them this time around? It\u2019s an odd way to organize a season of television, even if it\u2019s customary for Game of Thrones to ignore certain characters and/or storylines for weeks before reintroducing them to the fold.\nEven if we couldn\u2019t spend time with Arya and Gendry, why couldn\u2019t we have spent a little time with the Cersei-lusting pirate Salladhor Saan? If there was ever a time to bring that character back, it would have been tonight. Even if he only had a line or two about how anxious he was to fuck Cersei before turning into a giant green fireball, it would have been something. Now? It turns out he wasn\u2019t a character so much as a walking, taking ship procurement system. I assume Tyrion isn\u2019t dead, but what about Davos? It would be stretching the limits of credibility should he and/or his son survive that blast. But I still feel like I don\u2019t know enough about him to care if he\u2019s really dead at this point. Game of Thrones keeps checking in on certain parts of Westeros out of obligation rather than narrative need. While certain combinations provide thematic resonance, it also means that the more time I spent in Qarth, the most anxious I become when those scenes don\u2019t seem to be anything more than table settings for the third season. Either keep me in Qarth and let things play out in more than 5-minute intervals each week or just hold off entirely. This in-between approach is hurting the show the longer it airs. Planning for the future is fine, and necessary. But playing for the here and now is also important, and vastly more vital.\nLast season\u2019s ninth episode, \u201cBaelor,\u201d was a statement both for Game of Thrones as a story but also as a television show. Even if everyone involved in the game wasn\u2019t present for Ned Stark\u2019s death, the reverberations from his death echoed into every part of the landscape. Just as the comet in this season\u2019s premiere episode united all players under one sky, Ned\u2019s death united all under one common event. The Battle of Blackwater featured ostensibly thousands of more deaths than Ned\u2019s beheading, but somehow still didn\u2019t feel quite as seismic across the Westeros landscape. This doesn\u2019t reflect poorly on the scale of battle achieved onscreen: while it was sometimes unfortunate, it wasn\u2019t the reason that the episode didn\u2019t truly have the same impact.\nRather, it\u2019s the scope of story involved tonight that is to blame. The impact of this battle affected those north of the wall or east of the narrow sea about as much as it seemingly impacted those inside the Holdfast. (Which is to say, barely at all.) There may be reverberations down the line, to be certain. While the Lannisters still hold the Iron Throne, there will be some changes to come due to Tywin\u2019s return. Maybe Ned\u2019s death is a one-time thing, not unlike Tyrion\u2019s wildfire trick. One deployed, it can never truly have the same affect. But those looking for a repeat of the emotionally epic \u201cBaelor\u201d might have found this hour lacking. That\u2019s not damning \u201cBlackwater\u201d with faint praise. It just means that epic doesn\u2019t denote the number of people on screen. It denotes the amount we invest in those onscreen, no matter how small that number may be.\n", "episode_43": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.)\nThis might be the first episode of Game Of Thrones\u2019 second season that gives off a hint of discomfort, prompting squirming reactions akin to Milhouse watching Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie and saying, \u201cWhen are they going to get to the fireworks factory?\u201d Which, really, is to the show\u2019s credit. Since we\u2019re in the closing act of the season and shit is likely about to get real, an episode that\u2019s about getting characters in position is forgivable. While the show has mostly eschewed a storyline or two per episode to keep the focus narrowed and more involved, \u201cThe Prince Of Winterfell\u201d checks in with nearly the entire cast and ladles in a heavy dollop of romance to keep things intriguing. Which is fine, but when you\u2019re waiting for Stannis to invade King\u2019s Landing, or Daenerys to invade the House of the Undying, or Robb to invade anything, kissing will only get you so far.\nPerhaps the most involving stuff revolves around the titular Prince, Theon Greyjoy, who greets his sister to start the episode and quickly sees the writing on the wall: His triumphant conquest of Winterfell was meaningless before it began and even more so now that he\u2019s supposedly killed the Stark children (more on that later). It\u2019s amazing that Theon\u2019s plot still pulls focus, since he\u2019s such a difficult character and his behavior since arriving at Winterfell has been foolish even by his standards.\nBut Yara\u2019s surprisingly sympathetic confrontation, and Theon\u2019s insistence on seeing his conquest through, added even further shading to the twisted Greyjoy saga. Yara\u2019s moment of compassion for her brother kinda clicked everything into place. In all of the scenes on Pyke, Yara had come off as a bit of a kiss-ass; her reputation was clearly earned, but she basically chimed in on everything her father said. But here, alluding to she and Theon enduring Balon\u2019s parenthood and their connection as young children, Yara makes it clear that she\u2019s mostly interested in survival, not glory. The Greyjoys are not Targaryens, and they don\u2019t care about controlling the North; they\u2019re just perpetually in search of battle and strife and ways to prove themselves.\nOnce again, Theon\u2019s been acting like a mainlander, thinking Winterfell the grand prize (although his troublemaking first mate is partially to blame for all this). Later, it\u2019s confirmed that he didn\u2019t kill the Stark children\u2014just the two orphan boys, in an attempt to prove a point to the villagers. He offers to pay off the farmer to keep his mouth shut, but, of course, the farmer has already been put in the ground by Theon\u2019s men. Theon\u2019s demise, or at least his overthrow, can\u2019t be far off. Yara knows it, telling him to leave and not die near the sea. But I understand Theon\u2019s thinking: He can\u2019t return to the Starks, he can\u2019t go back to his father, so why not stand his ground?\nThe Stark family is behaving pretty badly right now too (although for far better reasons than Theon). Last week\u2019s little cliffhanger with Catelyn and Jaime is resolved with a fairly surprising twist: She sends Brienne off with him to trade him for her daughters, a bonehead move by anyone\u2019s standards since Jaime is one of the best fighters in the world and Brienne, walking into King\u2019s Landing, would pretty much be doomed to death. Remember, this is Cersei we\u2019re dealing with: she\u2019s doesn\u2019t honor contracts brokered by Petyr Baelish.\nIt\u2019s a twist that\u2019s been hinted at for many episodes, though, and it\u2019s a dramatically promising one. Robb has to lock Catelyn up to try and fend off further discord within his own forces. Meanwhile, the quippy, nihilistic Jaime is on the road with the pious Brienne, a comedy team made in heaven. This\u2019ll be a great way to draw both characters out of their shells. They\u2019re both very intriguing, but they both operate behind a thick veneer: Jaime\u2019s dark humor seems to be masking even darker pain, and Brienne\u2019s thick skin has obviously been built up over years of taunting. So setting them to work on each other is a genius move.\nA much less surprising twist comes when Robb finally hooks up with Talisa. The most interesting thing about this plotline is the actress playing Talisa, Oona Chaplin, is Charlie Chaplin\u2019s granddaughter; otherwise, it\u2019s been a bit of a slow burn (plausible, considering how busy Robb is). Talisa\u2019s description of life in Volantis is fascinating, however, especially the fishing-boat slave with a fish tattooed to his face, since it hints at the complicated back-story of slavery in this universe that is still mostly unknown to us.\nMostly, though, this is just another screw-up for Robb, who\u2019s a master on the battlefield but increasingly showing his ineptitude everywhere else. I guess it wasn\u2019t his fault that he trusted Theon, or his mother, but this is an area where he easily could have avoided trouble. Just\u2026 don\u2019t hang out with the sexy Volanti nurse, dude! It\u2019s a big camp, you\u2019re in charge, you don\u2019t have to run into each other!\nAlso in the doomed romance department: Shae\u2019s brush with danger at the hands of Cersei, who captures and tortures another prostitute (poor old Ros, who\u2019s really been through the wringer on this show) thinking she\u2019s Tyrion\u2019s girl. For Tyrion, the fact that Cersei even got that close is enough to strike mortal fear in his heart, which means Cersei is right: Tyrion\u2019s love for Shae is his weakness, and it\u2019s going to get him in trouble. The fun stuff in King\u2019s Landing comes with Varys, Bronn, and Tyrion, essentially the brain trust at this point, desperately trying to figure out how to defend the city. Joffrey has his own half-baked plans, but as Varys and Tyrion confide in each other, if they want to survive (and boy do they want to survive), they\u2019re going to have to work on something better. It\u2019s the closest thing to an alliance Tyrion has struck, and whether it\u2019ll prove to be fruitful remains to be seen. But it\u2019s fun to see them making friends.\nElsewhere, there are brief check-ins with the other major characters. Stannis chats with Davos about his working-class origins and Stannis\u2019 own bitterness at being denied the Baratheon homestead under Robert. Stephen Dillane is absolutely electrifying in this role, which is funny since Stannis is such a grump and his idea of delivering praise is utterly unenthusiastic. Still, he\u2019s magnetic; it\u2019s understandable why he\u2019d rub some people the right way even as he rubbed so many the wrong way.\nArya, denied the chance to kill Tywin (though did she ever really want to?), uses her brains and persuades Jaqen to set her free by naming Jaqen as her final target. It\u2019s a nice capper to the Harrenhal storyline (although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not the last we\u2019ve seen of Jaqen). I\u2019m just glad Gendry\u2019s still alive and we\u2019re not going to have to endure more grim scenes at the burned castle without Tywin around to cheer me up.\nJon, up north, has been captured along with the Halfhand, who seems to have notions of infiltrating the Wildlings by sowing fake discord between them. Anything that gives us more info on the Wildlings (like the Lord of Bones dude this week) is welcome. Meanwhile, Ygritte repays her own life debt by arguing for Jon\u2019s life, a nice reversal that maintains the wildlings\u2019 menace without Jon just being killed on sight.\nFinally, Daenerys doesn\u2019t have much to do except ponder going into the House of the Undying (Jorah just wants to get the fuck out of there, but he\u2019s a scaredy-cat). It\u2019s plots like these where you could really feel the episode stalling: obviously, some big denouement is going to happen with the warlocks, and we just\u2026 can\u2019t\u2026 quite get to it yet. But waiting is okay. If \u201cBaelor\u201d (episode nine of season one) is any yardstick to go by, next week\u2019s going to be crazy.\n", "episode_44": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.)\nIf there\u2019s a dominant theme emerging from this season of Game Of Thrones and the convoluted \u201cwar of the five kings,\u201d it\u2019s that everyone\u2019s best laid plans are absolutely meaningless. The many schemers and would-be rulers who are trying to set the table for ultimate conquest should be looking over their shoulders, because the situation is so constantly chaotic, it feels like the balance of power is upended every five minutes. Tyrion, who by this point is sporting a constantly worried expression, is smart enough to fear the future. But maybe the lame-brained Theon, whose conquest of Winterfell is going about as horribly as one would expect, has the smartest mindset. \u201cDon\u2019t look so grim,\u201d he tells a justifiably horrified Maester Luwin. \u201cIt\u2019s all just a game.\u201d\nHey, that\u2019s almost the name of the show! Many times, we\u2019ve seen how the antics (or gaming) of the ruling class in Westeros spill into the lives of the ordinary folk\u2014think of the poor butcher\u2019s boy, executed just for looking on as Arya humiliated Joffrey early in season one. But Theon\u2019s occupation of Winterfell is perhaps the starkest example yet. He arrived promising Bran that no one would get hurt as long as they surrendered\u2014that lasted about five minutes (R.I.P. Rodrik). Now, with his prize of Bran and Rickon vanished, Theon embarks on a scorched-earth approach to find them again, leading to the death of the two orphan boys who Bran sent to help on the farm last week.\nOh, sure, we\u2019re supposed to believe that the charred corpses Theon presents to the (tired-looking) populace of Winterfell are Bran and Rickon. But I find it hard to believe that the show would off one of its most crucial characters in such a way\u2014even this show. I\u2019ve read enough comic books to know that if the body is unidentifiable, and the murder happens off-screen, you shouldn\u2019t believe a word of it. Plus, it\u2019s Theon. The man can\u2019t do anything right (although he\u2019s finally getting his brutal crew in line, at the expense of his honor with anyone else). \u201cIt\u2019s better to be cruel than weak,\u201d he declares, but he\u2019s doomed himself to being weak by taking the easy approach at every turn. It\u2019s clear that Theon is a follower, not a leader\u2014his plot to re-take Winterfell was barely-planned nonsense designed to impress his father, just as his attempt to sway his father was just an attempt to impress Robb. At this point, he\u2019s basically taking orders from his first mate. I\u2019m looking forward to the cruel, but more-competent Yara to assess the situation whenever she decides to show up.\nArya\u2019s brief moment of carelessness last week (walking around with a secret war message in her hands) has similar reverberations this week, with Tywin instructing the Mountain to pillage the land looking for traitors after the death of his man before his very eyes. But we\u2019re spared whatever horror that is, as well as any sight of the \u201cbrotherhood without banners\u201d (some sort of dissident group the Mountain mentions). It\u2019s all just Tywin and Arya, matching wits together in Harrenhal, and dammit if they aren\u2019t some of the best scenes of the episode. It\u2019s all down to Charles Dance and Maisie Williams, who have been knocking it out of the park every week.\nThese scenes are actually a sneaky way for the show to get in some background exposition\u2014we\u2019re learning about the original Targaryen invasion, Tywin\u2019s weak father, etc., but it\u2019s all gripping stuff since you\u2019re watching Arya try to present the right balance of faithful servant and sharp-tongued Northerner to keep Tywin interested (and keep him from guessing her true identity). She can\u2019t help but desire his praise, since he is such an archetypal scary father figure (and, of course, Arya\u2019s in search of father figures). At the same time, it feels like Tywin knows something is up (Arya is too well-spoken and well-read to be a stonemason\u2019s daughter) but he doesn\u2019t really care because he gets a kick out of her. It\u2019s a balance of power that I\u2019m sure will eventually be upset, but for now it\u2019s fascinating to watch.\nBeyond the Wall, Jon\u2019s sexy adventures with Ygritte are moving along just as you\u2019d expect\u2014she constantly teases him about his blue balls until he\u2019s frustrated enough to be led into a trap and captured by wildlings. I\u2019m very much enjoying Ygritte\u2019s presence just for the energy it brings to scenes with the usually dour Jon, but I\u2019m even more interested in getting a better glimpse into Wildling life. So far, apart from Osha and Ygritte, they\u2019re just nameless Inuit warriors for the Watch to kill, but this is Game Of Thrones, and no villain is one-dimensional.\nOkay, except for Joffrey, who probably attracts the most ire from anyone who watches this show. He\u2019s never going to be afforded much sympathy, but we get the closest substitute here with Cersei and Tyrion having a frank discussion about the problem child, including Cersei admitting his parentage and Tyrion assuring her that the other kids are okay. (Two out of three ain\u2019t bad, right?) I love that the dynamic between Cersei and Tyrion is anything but simple. Sure, she\u2019s constantly professing her hatred of him and he\u2019s constantly needling her with mocking jokes, but there is still that unbreakable family connection. Tyrion looks sympathetic when Cersei starts crying\u2014sure, she\u2019s the one who had children with her brother and spoiled them rotten, and he should trust his sister as far as he can throw her, but there is still a core kernel of humanity there, and it\u2019s impressive that the show can still find it.\nCersei\u2019s \u201cflowering\u201d talk with Sansa serves as the companion to this discussion, of course. Sansa is rightly horrified at the concept that she\u2019s now ready to marry and have babies (and Shae threatens a handmaiden at knifepoint to try and keep it a secret) and rather than subject her to the usual bullying, Cersei acknowledges the issue\u2014what person in their right mind would want to marry Joffrey? Sansa sticks to the company line, of course, professing her undying love for her beloved king, but Cersei, who had a troublesome husband herself (although Robert was just boorish, not evil) knows the misery that awaits. As she explains, she dealt with it by hardening her heart, but that\u2019s not a fix when it comes to her children.\nThe ongoing saga of Qarth is beginning to bore\u2014particularly the Xaro character, who is constantly going on about how poor he used to be and how rich he is now and blah de blah. There\u2019s finally some action as Xaro and the warlock king take out the rest of the Thirteen in an alliance to rule the city, but I am growing as frustrated as Daenerys with everyone\u2019s circular dialogue, which is distracted by gaudy clothes and wacky behavior (the tile-faced lady casually paints a naked man while delivering her lines, just in case you didn\u2019t know she was peculiar).\nI was very heartened, though, by the return of Jaime late in the episode (he\u2019s been missing since the season opener, locked in his cage with nothing to do). He\u2019s probably the least fleshed-out major character on the show, but I\u2019ve always found him a fascinating mess of contradictions\u2014a paragon of knightly mojo who can fight and love better than anyone, but cares little for honor and less for ladies (except for his sister). He\u2019s getting even more cynical and jaded since being held captive, and his long scene with a lesser Lannister prisoner was undoubtedly the best of the episode.\nIt was clear, once Jaime started talking about a plan of escape, where things were heading\u2014despite the family bond (and the friendliness) between them, Jaime barely thinks about having to bash the boy\u2019s head in if it means a chance at escaping. Here\u2019s someone who would probably nod sagely at Theon\u2019s aphorism about it all being a game. To the end of the episode, even once he\u2019s been recaptured, Jaime is kidding with Catelyn and marveling at Brienne\u2019s proportions. Sure, there\u2019s the implication that he\u2019s baiting Catelyn because he wants to die (it\u2019d hurt Robb\u2019s bargaining position) but despite the cliffhanger, I doubt he\u2019s going anywhere, just when he\u2019s getting interesting.\n", "episode_45": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Game Of Thrones has been brutal before, it\u2019ll be brutal again, but there was something particularly gruesome about Theon\u2019s botched execution of Rodrik Cassel (or, as I always knew him, beard-braids) which ended with him basically kicking his head off. Cassel\u2019s death wasn\u2019t the only wince-worthy bit of violence in a particularly tough episode\u2014with Renly gone, the people of King\u2019s Landing rioting and Winterfell in the hands of the Greyjoys, things seem especially grim for Westeros right now.\nTheon\u2019s \u201csiege\u201d of Winterfell leads things off with a long string of scenes, brilliantly done in showing how quickly things can spin out of control in warfare, especially for someone in Theon\u2019s position. What was hinted at last week comes to fruition extremely quickly\u2014the castle is undefended because of Yara\u2019s attack, so Theon creeps in with a skeleton crew and rouses a particularly stubborn and uninterested Bran out of bed, declaring himself prince of the Iron Islands and Lord of Winterfell.\nThe whole thing seems almost comical at first. Bran can\u2019t even surrender the castle until someone finds Hodor, Theon is roundly mocked by the townspeople, and you get the impression that if Ned Stark was still around, none of this would be going on. But things take a sudden turn when Cassel spits in Theon\u2019s face and his first mate informs Theon that he must pay \u201cthe iron price\u201d for the affront. Even as he\u2019s conquered his old castle, it\u2019s clear that Theon\u2019s heart really isn\u2019t in it\u2014he\u2019s trying to impress his father and sister, sure, but he\u2019s also trying to save face with Bran and Maester Luwin, assuring them he won\u2019t hurt anyone. That goes out the window quickly, and after Cassel\u2019s nasty death, Theon is definitely a lot further over to the dark side.\nFortunately, Osha makes like Jenna Maroney and manages to get Bran and Rickon (and Hodor) out of the castle\u2026using her sexuality! I liked how this picked up a stray thread from season one (Theon had rather aggressively hit on her when she was taken captive) and further cemented Osha\u2019s status as one of the baddest of badasses around. With the introduction of another wildling this week, it\u2019s obvious that the people beyond the Wall are smart, cunning and resourceful\u2014hardly the savages we\u2019ve been hearing about for so long.\nJon\u2019s portion of the story was his strongest of the season so far. Not that I don\u2019t like Sam and Jeor and all the Watch lads, but it\u2019s nice to have him interacting with some new characters (who aren\u2019t pedophilic, incestuous farmers). Halfhand is another in a long line of cold-as-ice Night\u2019s Watch motherfuckers (RIP Yoren) who\u2019s there to cut right through Jon\u2019s idealism, lest he start thinking too loftily and try and save the world by himself. Seems Jon is always hell-bent on saving the world by himself. After bucking up his spirit with talk of Jon\u2019s eventual death being a gift to those south of the Wall, even though they\u2019ll never know his name, Halfhand immediately undercuts himself with a chuckle. If the Night\u2019s Watch are grizzled, the rangers beyond the Wall are several levels more so.\nYgritte the wildling is grizzled in her own way, but it\u2019s pretty obvious what purpose she\u2019s going to serve\u2014finally, a love interest for Jon, whose good looks have been utterly wasted so far serving up north. The whole thing is very contrived\u2014Halfhand can obviously sense how green Jon is, but he leaves him to execute the gorgeous Ygritte on his own. When Jon can\u2019t do it, he chases after her and then they\u2019re lost together and have to snuggle up on a mountain just to survive the night. It\u2019s all very meet-cute, really. But it\u2019s also nice to have Jon out of his element. It\u2019s more plausible that he\u2019d behave stupidly with a pretty lady than, say, when he\u2019s at Craster\u2019s house.\nWhile things are getting worse up north, the situation is no better in King\u2019s Landing, where a riot breaks out after the departure of Myrcella for Dorne and Joffrey handles the situation about as well as you\u2019d expect. To be fair, this wasn\u2019t your run-of-the-mill riot\u2014a few slogans shouted, some shop windows smashed, etcetera. No, this is an angry, hungry crowd\u2014it\u2019s not too long before people\u2019s limbs are getting torn off and Joffrey is shouting for everyone\u2019s head. Tyrion yells at him (and smacks him, very satisfyingly) for losing his cool, but I don\u2019t know how much better I would have performed under that sort of pressure.\nSadly, the worst wound Joffrey suffers outside of the slap is some cow shit to the face. Sansa is almost raped before being rescued by the Hound, who takes care of things in his usual brute force fashion. But his affection for Sansa is obvious (\u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you,\u201d he tells Tyrion), another in a long line of inappropriate romantic interests on Game Of Thrones. I hope the Hound gets more fleshed out in the weeks to come, because there\u2019s definitely an interesting dynamic between him and his master (and his brother). He\u2019s just as brutal, but without the explosive temper, and with more of a sense of right and wrong.\nWith all this nastiness going on, Arya\u2019s plot is downright hilarious by comparison. She\u2019s trying to avoid Petyr\u2019s gaze when he visits Tywin (and offers an alliance with the Tyrells), she\u2019s making off with Tywin\u2019s battle plans by distracting him with talk of his father, she\u2019s rushing Jaqen through his assassination of another Lannister stooge before he reveals that he\u2019s rumbled her to her new boss. Okay, none of it\u2019s laugh-out-loud funny (except for the usually inscrutable Jaquen\u2019s eye-roll when Arya insists that he kill Amory Loch right away) but it\u2019s funny how much of a relief the Harrenhaal scenes have become, just because Charles Dance and Maisie Williams are giving possibly the two best performances in the show. I liked the shades of grey we\u2019re getting for Tywin\u2014raised by a weak, loving father, he reversed the polarity for his own children, and has achieved great success but at an obvious cost.\nDaenerys\u2019 misadventures on Qarth are continuing to move pretty darn slowly. The return of the mellifluous Spice King (the first man to greet her when she arrived at the city\u2019s gates) heralded another exchange where he\u2019s excessively, patronizingly polite and Daenerys tries to win him over whatever way she can\u2014through flattery, royal majesty, and finally just by being downright threatening. The revelation at the end that her dragons had been taken felt like something that was a long time coming\u2014they were being kept in wooden boxes, for God\u2019s sake\u2014but it\u2019s probably just going to lead to more negotiations with another Qarthian weirdo while Xaro looks on talking about how freaking rich he is.\nEpisode six of season one was \u201cA Golden Crown,\u201d and it ended with Drogo dumping liquid gold onto Viserys\u2019 head. I remember that being the episode that really locked a lot of people into this show. I don\u2019t know that season two has quite the same narrative thrust at this point\u2014there\u2019s a lot of stagnation both in the Westeros war and abroad\u2014but this show has been as compelling as ever right out of the gate and has never flagged. With this many plot elements spinning around, there\u2019s just always much more to look forward to every week.\n", "episode_46": "\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

Have you read the books and want to discuss what\u2019s coming? That\u2019s what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.)\nThis week\u2019s Game Of Thrones begins about as shockingly as can be expected, even from a show this twisty, to the extent that I don\u2019t want to delve into the plot in my first paragraph for fear that it\u2019ll spoil people who accidentally clicked on a link. So, just\u2026 get out of here, folks.\nThe end of last week\u2019s episode was brilliant and strange: A writhing, naked Melisandre birthing a shadow monster for obviously nefarious purposes, a representation of magic on the show that still felt somewhat grounded in reality\u2014she didn\u2019t read from a spellbook; she physically birthed this shadowy assassin with the assistance of a love- and power-struck Stannis Baratheon. Still, considering the abruptness of the opening scene in \u201cThe Ghost Of Harrenhal,\u201d I don\u2019t know if that was the right place to cut off episode four.\nChatting with Catelyn about an alliance with Robb (and the chat seems to be going well for the Starks), Renly sheds his armor as one would, and shockingly quickly, he\u2019s stabbed to death, with the shadow monster there and gone before anyone can really take stock of what\u2019s happened. A grief-stricken Brienne, found over the body, is the immediate suspect, which means we\u2019re treated to some more conventional violence from her in some of the show\u2019s nicest, roughest swordplay yet (further evidence of her skill as a warrior).\nBut it\u2019s just impossible to take stock of anything that\u2019s happening, because Renly\u2019s death comes out of nowhere. Now, obviously that shadow creature was going to be up to no good, and Stannis\u2019 threat to Renly (something along the lines of surrendering before nightfall or facing his doom) ties all the foreshadowing together fine. But there\u2019s so much left to explore with Renly\u2014his relationships with Loras and Margery, not to mention his enmity with Stannis, being the prime examples.\nThere\u2019s an obvious answer to that complaint\u2014unless David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are really veering from the source material with this, Renly\u2019s death occurs within the pages of\u00a0A Song Of Ice And Fire, probably as sharp and sudden as it feels here. Plus, his death creates an interesting power vacuum for the show to explore\u2014his large army and natural charisma (and potential alliance with Robb) made him an obvious favorite for the crown, which will now be fought over by the far less palatable Joffrey and Stannis (neither of whom are remotely interested in preserving Robb as King in the North).\nHappily, it looks like the two new characters presented out of the short Renly arc\u2014Margery and Brienne\u2014aren\u2019t going anywhere. Brienne helps Catelyn out of trouble (how she does so isn\u2019t clear, but they\u2019re eventually in some secluded clearing with their horses) and swears an oath of fealty to her. She\u2019s a bit serious, but that insane physical strength mixed with a righteous, pious, honest outlook will be fun to explore. Knowing Game Of Thrones, her righteousness and piousness will quickly be beset on all sides by the world\u2019s more cynical, venal forces.\nLuckily, Margery\u2019s already well on the way there\u2014her husband is barely cold before she\u2019s telling Loras to spirit her away and hinting to Petyr that she\u2019s amenable to new arrangements. \u201cDo you want to be a Queen?\u201d he asks. \u201cNo. I want to be the Queen,\u201d she replies, which is basically music to Petyr\u2019s ears. Not to say that Margery is being presented as any kind of villain\u2014just an operator working on Petyr\u2019s level, free of any idealism or romanticism about the world. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, this is a show where operators thrive as its best characters, and I expect no less from the new\u00a0widow.\nSpeaking of operators, Tyrion has taken to conducting his secret meetings in a tiny little portable chamber, a rare visual gag about his stature. Tyrion\u2019s scenes are often the funniest on the show but there\u2019s an especially comedic bent this time around\u2014something about how he\u2019s treating poor, stammering Lancel, plus his buddy-cop scenes with Bronn stalking around the city (his horror at a street preacher calling him a \u201cdemon monkey\u201d was especially funny). Things do get serious again, with the introduction of \u201cwildfire,\u201d some sort of weapon of mass destruction that Cersei commissioned in secret. But even Tyrion\u2019s scenes inspecting the stuff with Bronn and a comically old alchemist had a lighter touch to them\u2014a welcome one, considering how grim everything was last week.\nHarrenhal, luckily, isn\u2019t quite the horror show that it was in the previous episode\u2014Tywin\u2019s calming influence has put everyone to work as prisoners of war, but even though he\u2019s figured out that Arya is a northern girl, she\u2019s still smart enough to avoid dropping hints about her nobility. Maisie Williams is really doing wonderful work this season\u2014her material is challenging, subduing Arya\u2019s firecracker nature (with flashes of\u00a0it when she talks to Gendry). And more than anyone else on the show, she makes you feel the impact of Ned\u2019s death. Her response to Tywin when he asks her about the rumors surrounding her brother (he\u2019s a shape-changing immortal warrior) is intended to throw him off the scent, but she definitely believes it\u2014\u201cAnyone can be killed.\u201d\nNow that her buddy from the cage who she rescued is out and about, it turns out that he\u2019s some sort of ninja (at least, he\u2019s from a foreign land) who offers to kill three people for her to repay his debt. Arya picks the torturer from last week, which I understand, but dude, pick the Mountain, or Tywin! If not Joffrey! At least now that you know this guy\u2019s got the skills, put him to more interesting work on your little death list.\nThings remain grim up north, getting grimmer, although Theon\u2019s new crew does have fun at his expense before they set about trying to conquer all of the North. Bran inches forward on understanding his prophetic dreams (Osha doesn\u2019t tell him what a three-eyed crow means to preserve his spirits, which isn\u2019t a good sign). And up beyond the Wall, we get the most dramatic imagery of the show so far. While the Wall stuff was shot in Ireland last season, it moved up to Iceland this year, and you can tell\u2014the \u201cFist of the First Men\u201d location is beautiful.\nWe finally got some justification for the time spent with Craster, too\u2014it helped Jeor recognize that Jon might not work out as a steward, since he\u2019s such a dopey fool. So now Jon\u2019s going on a secret mission with an especially frostbitten ranger called Halfhand to infiltrate the wildings; meanwhile, Sam will serve as Jeor\u2019s steward, a development that makes perfect sense.\nFinally, there\u2019s Qarth, where I feel the show is also having a bit of fun\u2014each one of the cast of characters Daenerys has to deal with is more insane-looking than the last, from a skeletal warlock to a woman wearing a mosaic on her face. Xaro comes across as a bit more normal\u2014he\u2019s incredibly rich, a self-made man, and he wants to marry Daenerys and buy her an army, an offer she\u2019s understandably tempted by. He\u2019s also smart enough to sow discord between Daenerys and Jorah, implying that he\u2019s sticking around for love, not as an adviser.\nThat makes Jorah come across as especially clingy in his scene with Daenerys when he warns against invading with an army she\u2019s bought, even though he\u2019s right. It also makes his proclamation that she is worthy of ruling because she can be both feared and loved seem like a declaration of love. Which it probably is, in a way, but it also crystalizes the show\u2019s case for Daenerys as Queen\u2014ignore the Targaryen creepiness and the unfortunate genetic stock of her brother and insane father, there\u2019s something special about her, especially when up against the folks trying to capture the throne right now. It\u2019s the most fascinating part of the show\u2014trying to bring us around to the side of a conqueror.\n", "episode_47": "\n\n(This\u00a0Game Of Thrones\u00a0post is written from the point of view of someone who has not read the books the series is based on.

That's what our\u00a0experts reviews\u00a0are for.)\nWell, that was a bit of a bummer, wasn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not tuning into Game Of Thrones expecting a breezy laugh riot. This is a show with real emotional peaks and valleys\u2014especially heavy on the valleys\u2014so it\u2019s not like I was surprised by the grim content of \u201cGarden Of Bones.\u201d With a title like that, Tyrion is hardly going to start singing show tunes for us, fun as that might be. Still, the episode has a tighter focus, excising a lot of settings (Winterfell, beyond the Wall, Pyke) and upping the intensity as a result.\nThere\u2019s real plot movement on some fronts, too. After brief scenes in the first two episodes (and nothing in the third), Daenerys finally finds somewhere to hang her dragon boxes by encountering the walled city of Qarth, which appears to be run by a council of thirteen rich, fat bald dudes who are very interested in looking at her pets (and far less interested in the Dothraki stragglers behind her). It\u2019s a little silly of me to describe this scene as \u201cplot movement,\u201d since we barely get a glimpse inside Qarth\u2014it\u2019s all just negotiations over whether Daenerys can get in without exposing her dragons to the council.\nStill, it\u2019s a well-played scene, especially on Emilia Clarke\u2019s end. She conveys Daenerys\u2019 natural terrifying Targaryen charisma, threatening to burn the city down once her dragons get big, but it\u2019s also obvious that she\u2019s at her wits\u2019 end. One of the more pleasant rich fat bald dudes, a younger fellow by the name of Xaro Xhoan Daxos (would it shock you to learn that I had to look that name up?), speaks up for Daenerys and gets her inside, but I have a sneaking suspicion that perhaps this is not the end of her journey. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s just going to rent a hotel, put her feet up, and charge 10 bucks for a look at the dragons.\nThings have been moving along at a decent clip for most of the Westeros storylines, which is perhaps why Daenerys\u2019 plot seems draggy. Or it might just be the relative blandness of the desert setting when compared to some of the series\u2019 more peculiar locations (although the desert is plenty dramatic, don\u2019t get me wrong). Either way, I\u2019m hoping the mysteries of Qarth will be enough to get things going on this end. One of the most memorable thing about the season one finale was those dragons getting born\u2014that doesn\u2019t have to get paid off this very second, but Daenerys\u2019 journey can\u2019t be coasting on that moment alone for too long either.\nOver to grim old Westeros, where things start off positively\u2014Robb wins another victory against the Lannisters, taking their forces by surprise\u2014but otherwise, the horrors of war seem to be setting in. I\u2019m still a little bummed that we haven\u2019t seen a real battle yet on this show. It finds cool ways to get around it, like Tyrion getting whacked in the head last year or Robb\u2019s dramatic secret entrance in the rain here, but before the season is done, I\u2019d love to see a bit of hacking and slashing. Here, we get a view of the aftermath, with Robb interacting (flirting, in a serious sort of way) with a Florence Nightingale-type on the battlefield, and of course it\u2019s a nice bit of character development for steely old Robb, who is one of the show\u2019s least-defined characters.\nIn the first season, Robb was just the level-headed brother trying to grasp the reins of responsibility while Theon flew off the handle or Jon moped about. There still isn\u2019t a lot more to him\u2014although Richard Madden is doing a fine job in the role\u2014but the only impression we get is his trepidation about the trappings of power (even though he seems to be good at winning battles). So maybe this is laying the groundwork for some future development on his side. He can\u2019t always be in his tent looking at maps and talking to old bearded men.\nRobb\u2019s victory has the unfortunate, if predictable effect of throwing Joffrey into a rage, and we\u2019re treated to a heart-rending scene of humiliation where he has Sansa stripped in front of the court at crossbow-point by his jerky bodyguards (although the Hound seems unimpressed by this behavior). Tyrion cements his status as the show\u2019s best character by breaking it up and shaming the knights following Joffrey\u2019s orders (Sansa keeps her cool and proclaims her love for Joffrey again, upping Tyrion\u2019s awed pity for her) and I thought maybe that was it from Joffrey this week. Another friendly reminder of what a piece of shit he is, just in case I fell on my head since last week and forgot.\nExcept no, that\u2019s not all. Tyrion and Bronn decide that the king is acting out partly because he\u2019s so horny (although, as Bronn notes, just having sex won\u2019t solve his problem\u2014\u201cthere\u2019s no cure for being a cunt\u201d). So Tyrion gifts him some prostitutes, which in the Game Of Thrones universe is akin to a fruit basket, at least among the aristocrats. It all goes horribly wrong, though, and descends into a nightmare of torture and death for the two women as Joffrey indulges his sadistic side (while also sending a message to his uncle, although that seems almost beside the point).\nI don\u2019t know how much more that scene brought to the table\u2014there\u2019s nobody watching this show who isn\u2019t already convinced that Joffrey is evil incarnate, and that scene with Sansa definitely hints at a nasty sexual streak. But it does cement in our minds that Joffrey isn\u2019t a child, stripping Sansa in front of the court of a whim\u2014there\u2019s a tactical element to what he\u2019s doing with the prostitutes, an attempt to shock and awe his uncle, as well as revel in his own sadomasochistic tendencies.\nThat was bad enough, but the goings-on at Harrenhal, this new \u201ccursed\u201d castle that Arya has been dragged to, are no picnic either. One definitely gets a whiff of Abu Ghraib from the whole scene\u2014Arya and Gendry and the rest of them are being tortured, one by one, ostensibly for the purposes of war intelligence, but it\u2019s pretty obvious that this is a bunch of kids who know nothing. One thing I wasn\u2019t quite clear on: Is the big bearded dude picking them out for torture the Mountain from last season, the guy who cut off the horse\u2019s head? Because he looks different, but I\u2019m pretty sure Arya was referring to him in her little list of people she\u2019d like dead (an idea taken from the sadly dead Yoren). He may have been recast from his brief (but very memorable) appearance last year.\nEither way, it\u2019s a grim scene for poor Arya, alleviated only by the surprising appearance of Tywin Lannister, who shows up being the monster badass that we all remember from last year (The monologue Charles Dance delivers while cutting open that stag remains one of my favorite moments in the whole show). He instantly tells the weird, evil idiots running the show at Harrenhal to stop being weird, evil idiots, points out that Arya\u2019s a girl, and hires her as his cup-holder. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s a good guy, but it\u2019s nice to see a smart villain on this show (Joffrey and company certainly don\u2019t cut it in that regard).\nFinally, the grim scale goes off the charts with the return of Stannis, who has a tense, failed meeting with his brother that was one of the best scenes of the episode. Stephen Dillane is doing a great job with this role\u2014as prickly and mean as Stannis is, he\u2019s pretty damn fascinating. That dour intensity could be boring in a lesser actor\u2019s hands, but Dillane makes you aware of all the insecurity below the surface. Stannis might talk big, but he\u2019s definitely cowed by his younger brother\u2019s popularity. So much so that he bids Melisandre (who is her usual chipper self) to go\u2026 give birth to a shadowy nightmare monster in a cave. I assume the shadow nightmare monster will immediately get to brokering peace between everyone, and definitely won\u2019t be used for nefarious purposes.\nWhile I\u2019m praising Dillane, I should also throw in some support for Liam Cunningham, who is doing a great job as the increasingly horrified Davos. Cunningham\u2019s been great many times in his years as a journeyman actor\u2014I loved him in Shooting The Past years ago, and his long, unbroken dialogue scene with Michael Fassbender in Hunger is a sight to behold. But as much as I enjoy the Stannis scenes, I\u2019m very much glad Davos is there to keep the audience grounded, and keep Melisandre from dominating the frame with her craziness.\nThis shadow pregnancy has to be the most outwardly magical the show has been so far, or at least on the level of Drogo\u2019s re-animation last year. Sure, you have Bran looking through the wolf\u2019s eyes, and as far as I know dragons are fantastical creatures, but what Melisandre is up to this season is out-and-out sorcery. It should be a little jarring on a show that mostly apes the wars of the roses and has lots of medieval pageantry and deal-making. But because everything fantastic is introduced so gradually, it comes off well. Melisandre\u2019s birthing doesn\u2019t come from her reading from a spellbook or waving a wand around; it\u2019s tied to her sexual hold over Stannis and his burning desire for power. Game Of Thrones is doing something right if the audience watches the horrifying, bizarre scene that ends this episode and nods, saying, \u201cthat makes sense.\u201d\n"}
